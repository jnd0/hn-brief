# Hacker News Summary - 2025-11-21

## [Helping Valve to power up Steam devices](https://www.igalia.com/2025/11/helpingvalve.html)
**Score:** 859 | **Comments:** 315 | **ID:** 46006616

> **Article:** The article details Igalia's contract work for Valve to improve the open-source graphics stack on Qualcomm Adreno GPUs. Specifically, they developed and optimized Mesa3D's "Turnip" Vulkan driver and a custom Linux kernel scheduler ("EEVDF" with specific patches) to deliver high-performance, low-latency gaming on ARM-based devices. The work is framed as a necessary intervention, since hardware vendors like Qualcomm typically neglect robust Linux driver development. This effort is positioned as foundational work for future Valve hardware, potentially including an ARM-based Steam Deck.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, viewing Valve's funding of open-source consultancy (Igalia) as a rare example of a corporation acting as a "good citizen" in the Linux ecosystem. There is a strong consensus that Qualcomm and other ARM vendors fail to provide adequate driver support, forcing the community to reverse-engineer or build critical infrastructure from scratch.

Key insights and disagreements include:
*   **The "ARM Steam Deck" Theory:** Many commenters speculate that this low-level optimization work confirms Valve is preparing an ARM-based successor to the Steam Deck. However, others temper this, suggesting Valve is simply hedging its bets to ensure they aren't locked into x86 if ARM becomes the dominant mobile architecture.
*   **The "NIH" (Not Invented Here) Critique:** A minor disagreement arises regarding the kernel scheduler. One user argues Valve/Igalia ignored existing community solutions (like the BORE scheduler used in Bazzite Linux) to reinvent the wheel. Others counter that Valve's approach is a more rigorous upstream contribution rather than a niche fork.
*   **Valve's Business Model:** Commenters praise Valve's private ownership structure, contrasting it with shareholder-driven companies that would not fund such unglamorous, long-term infrastructure work.
*   **Igalia's Reputation:** The consultancy is highly respected for their "thankless" technical contributions to projects like WebKit and Mesa, though some users admit they wish they had the skills to work on such low-level systems themselves.

Overall, the sentiment is that this is a significant technical win for the open-source ecosystem, driven by Valve's unique willingness to invest in platform-agnostic infrastructure.

## [Show HN: Wealthfolio 2.0- Open source investment tracker. Now Mobile and Docker](https://wealthfolio.app/?v=2.0)
**Score:** 676 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46006016

> **Project:** The author is showcasing "Wealthfolio 2.0," an open-source, self-hosted investment tracker. The key updates are the availability of a mobile app and a Docker deployment option. The project aims to provide a privacy-focused, subscription-free alternative to commercial fintech apps, allowing users to track investments across various institutions in a single dashboard. It supports manual entry or automated data fetching via providers like Yahoo Finance and AlphaVantage.
>
> **Discussion:** The reception is largely positive, with users praising the app's polished UI and the commitment to open-source. The discussion highlights a few key themes:

*   **Inspiration and Niche:** The author admits the design is inspired by Wealthsimple, which is viewed as a positive by commenters. The project fills a specific niche for users wanting a unified view of their finances without relying on a commercial service.
*   **The Privacy vs. Automation Trade-off:** A central debate emerges around the core tension of self-hosted finance: privacy versus convenience. While users love the idea of keeping data local, many, like GoatOfAplomb, admit they are unwilling to give up automated bank syncing. The author suggests an optional aggregator integration could bridge this gap.
*   **Competition and Comparison:** Users compare Wealthfolio to alternatives like Actual Budget (better for budgeting, less for investments), Ghostfolio, and Quicken. The consensus is that Wealthfolio is a strong contender for investment tracking specifically.
*   **Usability Hurdles:** The most critical feedback comes from a user who ran into significant onboarding issues. They reported UI bugs (modals being cut off), a difficult manual process for handling stock splits, and poor CSV import handling for major brokerages like Schwab. This suggests that while the app looks polished, the user experience for importing and maintaining data needs refinement to be a truly viable alternative.

Overall, the project is seen as a promising and visually appealing tool, but its success will depend on smoothing out the rough edges of data import and maintenance, which are the primary pain points for users migrating from automated commercial services.

## [We Induced Smells With Ultrasound](https://writetobrain.com/olfactory)
**Score:** 676 | **Comments:** 184 | **ID:** 46008332

> **Article:** The linked article describes a proof-of-concept method for inducing olfactory sensations (smells) in humans using focused ultrasound (FUS) to stimulate the olfactory bulb in the brain. By directing ultrasonic waves through the nasal cavity to specific brain regions, the researchers claim they can make subjects perceive distinct smells—such as popcorn, smoke, or ammonia—without any external chemical odorants present. The technique essentially "hacks" the sense of smell by directly triggering the neural processing centers, bypassing the nose entirely.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of genuine scientific curiosity, speculative futurism, and standard internet cynicism.

**Consensus & Key Insights:**
*   **Technical Feasibility & VR:** There is interest in the potential for this technology to revolutionize VR and AR by adding a olfactory dimension ("Smell-O-Vision"), though the practical engineering challenges of miniaturizing the transducers for headsets are noted.
*   **Medical Parallels:** Several users with personal experience (or knowledge) of COVID-19-induced parosmia (smell distortion) noted that the "burning" or "chemical" smells reported in the study mirror their own phantom smell experiences, suggesting a shared neural mechanism.
*   **Scientific Context:** Users connected the phenomenon to the "Vibration Theory of Olfaction"—a somewhat fringe but historically significant theory that suggests smell is based on molecular vibrations rather than just shape, which aligns conceptually with using sound waves to trigger smell.

**Disagreements & Controversy:**
*   **Safety & Ethics:** A significant portion of the discussion focused on the terrifying implications of "write access" to the brain. Users expressed deep distrust of tech companies having direct neural control, joking about malicious "execute bits" and the potential for weaponization.
*   **Commercial Application:** While many envisioned high-minded uses (VR, medical), the inevitable "porn" application was debated. Some argued it's the logical first adopter for sensory tech, while others were repulsed by the idea of "scented" adult content.
*   **Skepticism of Results:** Some users questioned the validity of the specific smells reported (e.g., smoke, garbage), hypothesizing that the ultrasound might just be stimulating a generic "danger" response in the brain rather than precise, nuanced scents.

## [Personal blogs are back, should niche blogs be next?](https://disassociated.com/personal-blogs-back-niche-blogs-next/)
**Score:** 659 | **Comments:** 389 | **ID:** 46009894

> **Article:** The article posits that while personal blogs are experiencing a "revival" (a premise immediately questioned by the HN audience), the next logical step should be a return to niche, specialized blogs. It argues against the current trend of algorithmic, generalized content feeds, suggesting that focused, expert-driven content is due for a comeback. The piece essentially diagnoses the fatigue with mainstream social media and proposes a return to the web's roots as a solution, framing it as an evolution from the general "personal" to the specific "niche."
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely skeptical of the article's core premise. The consensus is that personal blogs never actually "left" for those who were already doing them, and that the structural barriers to a true renaissance—specifically the collapse of search engine utility and social media referral traffic—are insurmountable for new entrants. The "revival" is dismissed as a niche phenomenon, not a mass movement.

Key insights and disagreements include:
*   **Traffic is Dead:** The primary counter-argument is practical, not philosophical. Participants argue that discoverability is broken; search engines are filled with AI slop, and social media algorithms are explicitly designed to prevent users from leaving their platforms. The only exception noted is Bluesky, but its reach is still limited.
*   **The "Revival" is a Misnomer:** Multiple long-time bloggers state they haven't seen any change in traffic or participation, suggesting the "comeback" narrative is detached from reality. The activity is merely concentrated among a self-selecting group that never stopped.
*   **Federation as a Solution:** A recurring theme is the desire for federated alternatives to traditional forums and aggregators (like Reddit), indicating a search for new infrastructure rather than a simple return to old models.
*   **Implementation Paralysis:** On a personal level, potential bloggers admit to being bogged down by the technical details and the "fits and starts" of choosing a platform, highlighting that the barrier to entry isn't just distribution, but also the friction of getting started.

In essence, the HN crowd agrees with the *sentiment* of wanting more specialized, human-curated content but is deeply pessimistic about the viability of a large-scale return to the blog era due to a fundamentally broken discovery ecosystem.

## [A time-travelling door bug in Half Life 2](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@TomF/115589875974658415)
**Score:** 522 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46009962

> **Article:** The linked article is a Mastodon post by TomF, likely detailing a "time-travelling door bug" in Half-Life 2. The bug is caused by floating-point calculation inconsistencies between different CPU instruction sets. Specifically, the game's physics engine behaves differently depending on whether it's compiled to use the legacy x87 FPU instructions (with their 80-bit internal precision) or the more modern SSE instructions (which use strict 32-bit or 64-bit precision). This minute difference in math causes a door's physical interaction with an NPC to diverge, leading to a "time-travelling" effect where the door's state is calculated differently on different builds, breaking the expected gameplay sequence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a nostalgic and technical deep-dive into the perils of floating-point determinism in game development. The consensus is that this is a classic, well-known issue stemming from the transition away from the x87 FPU.

Key insights from the discussion include:
*   **Historical Precedent:** Commenters immediately identify this as a known problem, citing similar floating-point discrepancies in Team Fortress 2 (affecting Engineer metal counts on Linux vs. Windows) and other Source Engine games.
*   **The Root Cause:** The core issue is the x87 FPU's 80-bit internal precision, which is inconsistent with the 32-bit/64-bit floats used in memory and by SSE. This leads to non-deterministic results where a calculation might be just slightly different, causing a physics object to clip or not clip, leading to a major divergence in outcomes.
*   **Broader Implications:** The conversation broadens to include other infamous floating-point "gotchas," such as third-party DLLs (like handwriting software) resetting FPU control words and breaking an application's math, and the challenges of emulating consoles with non-standard floating-point behavior (e.g., PS2).
*   **Disagreements/Minor Debates:** There is a minor pedantic debate about whether HL2 doors are truly "physics objects" or just animated kinematic objects, though testing confirms they do interact with physics.
*   **Meta-Commentary:** A small tangent complains about the format of the original post (multi-paragraph on a microblogging platform), which is a classic HN gripe.

Overall, the thread serves as a "war stories" session for veteran engineers who have battled the non-deterministic ghosts of floating-point math.

## [We should all be using dependency cooldowns](https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/11/21/We-should-all-be-using-dependency-cooldowns)
**Score:** 489 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46005111

> **Article:** The article proposes "dependency cooldowns," a policy where developers intentionally delay applying automated dependency updates for a set period (e.g., 30 days). The core argument is that this waiting period allows time for the community to identify and report malicious packages or breaking changes before they are integrated into your project. It frames this as a necessary defense against supply chain attacks, arguing that the risk of a new update being malicious or buggy is higher immediately upon release than it is after a short vetting period. The goal is to trade the "freshness" of updates for increased stability and security.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a classic clash between pragmatic stability and security purism. There is no consensus, but the prevailing sentiment leans towards skepticism of the proposed method, favoring more traditional risk management.

**Key Disagreements & Insights:**

*   **The Vulnerability Window:** The most immediate objection is that a cooldown period leaves systems exposed to known vulnerabilities and bug fixes. Proponents counter that this is only true for "dumb" automated updates; developers are still expected to manually patch critical vulnerabilities immediately. The debate essentially boils down to whether developers will actually perform these manual interventions or if the cooldown becomes an excuse for general neglect.
*   **Automation vs. Professional Judgment:** Many senior engineers view the cooldown as a clumsy patch for a self-inflicted wound. The argument is that the problem isn't the speed of updates, but the over-reliance on unaccountable automation. The correct solution is to manage dependencies deliberately, updating when necessary for features or security, rather than blindly following upstream.
*   **The "LLM as a Filter" Idea:** A prominent sub-thread suggested using LLMs to triage the firehose of security reports and dependency changes. While technically interesting, it introduces a new layer of complexity and trust. The counterpoint is simple: sort by CVE score. It's a classic case of over-engineering a solution for a problem that can be solved with established, simpler methods.
*   **The Real Problem is Dependency Bloat:** A significant faction argued that the entire premise is a distraction. The real issue is having too many, or too complex, dependencies in the first place. The solution isn't to manage the firehose better, but to turn down the tap.
*   **The "Debian Stable" Model:** Several commenters pointed out that this entire problem was solved decades ago by Linux distributions with stable release cycles and long-term support. They curate and vet a set of dependencies, providing a single, coherent, and tested system. This is contrasted with modern language ecosystems where every project pulls in its own transient, unvetted dependency tree.

In summary, the discussion treats the "cooldown" as a naive solution to a complex problem. The more experienced voices suggest that the answer lies in better engineering discipline: reducing dependency counts, using established stable distributions, and applying human judgment rather than creating more complex automation to fix the flaws of previous automation.

## [How a French judge was digitally cut off by the USA](https://www.heise.de/en/news/How-a-French-judge-was-digitally-cut-off-by-the-USA-11087561.html)
**Score:** 486 | **Comments:** 545 | **ID:** 46003778

> **Article:** The article details how a French judge, Nicolas Guillou, a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), has been effectively "digitally cut off" by US sanctions. The sanctions were imposed because the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli political leaders, a move the US (and Israel) opposes. As a result, US-based companies, including major banks and tech firms, are legally compelled to sever ties with him. This has frozen his assets, blocked his access to payment systems, and made it nearly impossible for him to function in the modern digital economy. The article highlights a proposed countermeasure from the EU: activating a "blocking regulation" that would make it illegal for EU-based companies to comply with these US sanctions, potentially setting up a major legal and economic conflict between the US and the EU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of geopolitical analysis, legal debate, and existential concerns about the global financial system.

**Consensus & Key Insights:**
*   **US Financial Hegemony:** The central theme is the immense, unilateral power of the US to weaponize its control over the global dollar-based financial and tech infrastructure. Commenters recognize that US sanctions are not just a political tool but a mechanism that can instantly render an individual or entity a "non-person" in the global economy.
*   **The EU's Dilemma:** There's a clear understanding of the EU's precarious position. While the EU has a legal framework (the blocking regulation) to retaliate, doing so would risk a major rupture with the US, particularly given the ongoing war in Ukraine where US support is critical. This is seen as the core geopolitical tension.
*   **A Step Towards Decoupling:** Many see this incident as a significant step towards a "splinternet" or a decoupling of the US and EU economic and digital spheres. The conflict forces the EU to confront its dependency on US-controlled systems.

**Disagreements & Nuances:**
*   **Uniqueness of US Actions:** There's a minor debate on whether the US is uniquely villainous in this. One user claims it is, while others counter that many powerful nations act similarly, defining their own "war criminals" and "heroes" based on self-interest.
*   **Moral Stance:** The discussion touches on the ICC's jurisdiction and the merits of the warrants against Israeli leaders, but these points are secondary to the broader concern about the *mechanism* of the US response. The dominant sentiment is that the method (financial excommunication) is more alarming than the specific political dispute.
*   **Individual vs. Systemic:** Some comments focus on the personal impact on the judge, while others, like the "decentralization" argument, frame it as a systemic failure of centralized choke points, arguing that only a decentralized system (e.g., crypto) could offer true sovereignty.

**Tone:** The discussion is largely cynical and pragmatic, reflecting a deep-seated understanding of how global power dynamics actually function, independent of stated ideals. It's less about outrage over a specific injustice and more about a sober assessment of the capabilities and constraints of the current world order.

## [Olmo 3: Charting a path through the model flow to lead open-source AI](https://allenai.org/blog/olmo3)
**Score:** 390 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46001889

> **Article:** Allen AI (Ai2) has released OLMo 3, a new 32-billion-parameter language model. The headline feature is its "fully open" nature, which Ai2 claims makes it the best model in its class under this definition. The release includes the base model, post-training details, and a unique tool called "OLMoTrace," designed to show which parts of the model's training data may have influenced its output by finding matching n-grams. The announcement is accompanied by a blog post detailing the training and post-training process, positioning the model as a transparent alternative to more closed-off competitors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mixed bag of appreciation for genuine open-source efforts, practical benchmarking against existing models, and technical skepticism.

**Consensus & Appreciation:**
There is broad agreement that releasing a truly open-source model is commendable, especially in a landscape where "open" often comes with restrictive licenses. Users see this as a valuable contribution to the community.

**Disagreements & Practicality:**
*   **The "Best" Claim:** Skepticism arises over the "best fully open" title, with users pointing out that the pool of truly open models is small, making the claim a bit of a "low bar."
*   **Performance vs. Speed:** A key debate centers on utility. While OLMo 3 is praised for its openness, some users argue that for daily tasks, speed is king. Models like Qwen3-30B are highlighted as being "fast enough" and more practical, even if OLMo 3 might be technically superior in reasoning.
*   **Use Cases:** The model's capabilities are tested in real-time. One user successfully used a similar model (Gemma 32B) for a massive translation task, but another cautioned that small models are poor for translating into non-English languages, highlighting the limitations of "good enough."

**Key Insights & Criticisms:**
*   **OLMoTrace Scrutiny:** The traceability feature drew significant criticism. One user argued it's misleading because it only finds matching n-grams (short text snippets), not true attribution of knowledge. An Ai2 researcher clarified that the tool's purpose is to show *influence* (e.g., common phrases or jokes), not to claim the output is directly copied from a single source.
*   **Technical Quibbles:** A user went on a tirade about the poor quality of a chart in the blog post, citing misleading axes and a lack of labels as basic data visualization failures.
*   **Ecosystem Friction:** Early adopters reported issues with the model hanging in certain UIs, a common problem when new models are released before the wider software ecosystem catches up.
*   **Hardware Constraints:** Practical concerns about VRAM were raised, with users suggesting that a 20B model would be a more accessible sweet spot for consumer GPUs than the 32B release.

In short, the community views OLMo 3 as a noble and important project for AI transparency, but it faces immediate, practical competition from faster, more established models and skepticism regarding the marketing claims and specific features.

## [Arduino published updated terms and conditions: no longer an open commons](https://www.molecularist.com/2025/11/did-qualcomm-kill-arduino-for-good.html)
**Score:** 351 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46005553

> **Article:** The linked article, titled "Did Qualcomm kill Arduino for good?", posits that Arduino's recent update to its terms and conditions represents a fundamental betrayal of its open-source ethos. The author argues that the new terms, particularly the explicit denial of any patent licenses, effectively kill the "open commons" that Arduino was built on. The article frames this as a direct consequence of Arduino's acquisition by a larger corporate entity (Qualcomm), suggesting the community's goodwill is being monetized at the expense of its principles, turning a collaborative platform into a legally hazardous environment for tinkerers and small businesses.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely a cynical eulogy for the "old" Arduino, confirming the article's premise that the platform has lost its way under corporate ownership. The consensus is that the new terms are a hostile move, explicitly highlighted by the removal of implied patent licenses, which fundamentally undermines the project's open-source foundation. There's a palpable sense of "I told you so," with users noting that selling out a community-driven project inevitably leads to it being "squeezed for every penny."

However, the discussion reveals a significant practical disagreement: the immediate threat level. One camp argues that Arduino is already functionally dead for serious users, who have long since migrated to more powerful and open alternatives like ESP32, Teensy, and BeagleBone, often using modern toolchains like PlatformIO instead of the clunky Arduino IDE. The other camp contends that for its core niche—education and simple prototyping—Arduino's inertia and simplicity are still unmatched, and the changes aren't drastic enough to cause an immediate exodus.

Key insights from the discussion include:
*   **The "Why":** The acquisition is seen not just as a simple buyout, but as a strategic move by a large incumbent (Qualcomm) to neutralize a disruptive, commoditizing force in the embedded systems space.
*   **Historical Context:** Veteran users point out that Arduino's governance and licensing have always been a "mess," but the community's goodwill papered over the cracks. The platform's origins in the art-focused "Processing" language explain its initial design philosophy, which was less about general-purpose engineering and more about accessibility for a specific audience.
*   **The Real Fight:** The community's response is framed as a classic tech battle: the only way to fight "corpos" is with their feet—by migrating to genuinely open platforms and tools.

## [You can make PS2 games in JavaScript](https://jslegenddev.substack.com/p/you-can-now-make-ps2-games-in-javascript)
**Score:** 320 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46006082

> **Article:** The linked article announces that the "AthenaEnv" project enables game development for the Sony PlayStation 2 using JavaScript. It relies on QuickJS, a lightweight JavaScript engine by renowned developer Fabrice Bellard, to interpret code and interface with the PS2's native libraries. This allows developers to create homebrew games and applications for the 25-year-old console using a modern, web-centric language, effectively bypassing the need for the notoriously difficult PS2 SDK.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction is a mix of genuine excitement for the technical achievement and pragmatic skepticism regarding its utility.

**Consensus & Key Insights:**
*   **Technical Acclaim:** There is widespread admiration for the project, with frequent mentions of Fabrice Bellard (creator of QuickJS) as a prolific engineer whose work underpins many critical open-source projects. The consensus is that this is a clever and impressive feat of engineering.
*   **Practicality vs. Authenticity:** Users debate the real-world application. While some are genuinely interested in using it, others point out that running homebrew on real hardware is more easily achieved via memory card exploit (FreeMcBoot) and USB, making the disc-burning aspect a purely nostalgic novelty.
*   **Modern Console Limitations:** A key insight from the discussion is the difficulty of replicating this for modern consoles (Switch, PS5, Xbox). The primary blockers are the lack of JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation support, which cripples the performance of engines like V8, and the closed nature of the SDKs. This makes the PS2, ironically, a more accessible platform for this kind of low-level experimentation than a modern Nintendo Switch.

**Disagreements & Nuances:**
*   **Repost or Not?** One commenter flagged the article as a repost, but others defended it, noting that previous posts received little traction and that the linked articles were different. This is a classic HN debate over content curation.
*   **Platform Confusion:** A minor thread humorously confused "PS2" with the IBM PS/2 computer, leading to a discussion about a different JavaScript-for-DOS project (DOjS).
*   **Engineer's Dilemma:** The project is framed as a solution for those who "will do anything to avoid using Godot." While a user correctly retorted that Godot doesn't run on a PS2, the underlying sentiment is that this is a niche tool for hobbyists and purists, not a practical replacement for modern game engines.

In summary, the community sees this as a brilliant "because we can" project that highlights the enduring power of lightweight tools like QuickJS and the strange, niche-friendly nature of retro homebrew scenes.

## [Prozac 'no better than placebo' for treating children with depression, experts](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/20/prozac-no-better-than-placebo-for-treating-children-with-depression-experts-say)
**Score:** 306 | **Comments:** 518 | **ID:** 45999622

> **Article:** The linked article reports on a new meta-analysis of clinical trial data for fluoxetine (Prozac) in treating pediatric depression. The review concludes that, for children and adolescents, the drug's efficacy is statistically indistinguishable from a placebo. The article also highlights the known risks associated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in this age group, specifically the potential to increase suicidal ideation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a polarized and anecdotal battleground, reflecting the deep-seated divisions in public and personal experience with antidepressants. There is no consensus.

The debate splits into several camps:
*   **The "It Saved Me" Camp:** A significant number of users share powerful personal testimonials, claiming SSRIs were life-saving or life-changing after years of suffering, and that they are far more effective than placebo. They express skepticism towards studies that contradict their lived experience.
*   **The "It's Complicated" Camp:** This group provides nuanced technical and clinical context. Key insights include:
    *   **The "Functional vs. Desperate" Hypothesis:** One commenter argues that antidepressants were "miracle drugs" when used on desperately ill patients but appear less effective now due to over-prescription for milder cases, diluting the observed effect size.
    *   **The "Symptom vs. Root Cause" Problem:** Several users point out that by alleviating lethargy but not the underlying negative thought patterns, medication can paradoxically give a depressed person the energy to act on suicidal ideation.
    *   **The "Diagnostic Severity" Factor:** Effectiveness is likely tied to the severity of the illness; a drug's impact is less noticeable in a patient with mild depression.
*   **The "It's Dangerous" Camp:** Users share harrowing personal stories of severe side effects, including serotonin syndrome and homicidal psychosis, reinforcing the risks mentioned in the article.
*   **The "Skeptical of the Study" Camp:** Some question the study's methodology (short trial durations) or the validity of applying broad conclusions to a diverse population, arguing that the drugs work for specific sub-types of depression (e.g., endogenous vs. situational).

Overall, the discussion highlights the limitations of population-level studies when they conflict with individual outcomes. The core disagreement is whether the drug is a "crutch" that enables recovery or a blunt instrument with dangerous side effects for a problem that is often situational rather than purely chemical.

## [Homeschooling hits record numbers](https://reason.com/2025/11/19/homeschooling-hits-record-numbers/)
**Score:** 296 | **Comments:** 831 | **ID:** 45999842

> **Article:** The linked article from Reason.com reports that homeschooling in the US has reached record numbers. It attributes this surge to a combination of factors: the "laboratory" effect of COVID-19 remote learning, which gave parents a direct and often disappointing view of public school curricula and teaching quality; a perceived decline in public school academic rigor in favor of standardized test metrics; and deep dissatisfaction with the social environment of schools, citing issues like bullying and pervasive smartphone/social media influence. The article frames this as a market-driven rejection of a monopolistic public education system that is failing to meet the academic and social needs of students.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a polarized but nuanced debate on the merits and motivations behind the homeschooling boom. There is no consensus, but several key themes emerge:

**The "Why": A Crisis of Faith in Public Institutions**
The primary driver for homeschooling, as identified by commenters, is a profound loss of trust.
*   **Academic Decline:** Many parents feel public schools have de-prioritized core academics (especially math and science) in favor of "teaching to the test" or, more controversially, ideological instruction. One commenter cites San Francisco's delayed algebra curriculum as an example of egalitarianism trumping academic excellence.
*   **Social Toxicity:** The school environment is widely seen as broken. Parents cite the negative influence of smartphones, social media, and bullying as a key reason to remove their children.
*   **The COVID "Reveille":** The pandemic is repeatedly mentioned as the catalyst that forced parents to witness the state of education firsthand, shattering the illusion that the system was working.

**The "How": A Privilege of Logistics and Ideology**
*   **Feasibility:** A significant point of contention is the practicality of homeschooling. Commenters question if it's viable for single-income families or requires one parent to exit the workforce. Anecdotes suggest it's a logistical puzzle that can be solved with scheduling, but the demographic reality leans heavily towards stay-at-home mothers.
*   **The "Sports Grift":** A cynical and well-supported counter-narrative emerges that a large portion of the "homeschooling" boom is not academic at all. Instead, it's a strategy for parents to "red-shirt" athletic children—holding them back a year or two to gain a physical advantage in competitive sports when they re-enter the public school system. This is viewed by many as a self-serving and detrimental practice.

**The "What If": Co-ops and the Future**
*   **Hybrid Models:** The discussion moves beyond the isolated family unit to the rise of "group homeschooling" or co-ops, where parents pool resources. This is seen as a more efficient and social model, though some question if it's just a private school with less regulation.
*   **The AI Wildcard:** A few comments touch on the future relevance of education itself, with one suggesting AI will render traditional knowledge less valuable, potentially making the socialization aspect of school the only thing worth preserving.

**Overall Sentiment:**
The discussion is a microcosm of the "culture war" over education. One side sees homeschooling as a rational, liberating escape from a failing and ideologically captured system. The other side is deeply skeptical, viewing it as a combination of privileged opt-out, a vehicle for sports-obsessed parents, and a potential detriment to children's social development and the broader civic good. The debate is less about the *fact* of the trend and more about its underlying causes and long-term consequences.

## [HP and Dell disable HEVC support built into their laptops' CPUs](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/hp-and-dell-disable-hevc-support-built-into-their-laptops-cpus/)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46002989

> **Article:** The article, from a future Ars Technica in November 2025, reports that HP and Dell are disabling HEVC (H.265) hardware video decoding on certain laptop models. This feature is built into the Intel and AMD CPUs they purchase, but the manufacturers are intentionally disabling it in their OEM drivers to avoid paying the ~$0.25 per-unit licensing fee to the HEVC patent pool. The result is a degraded user experience, particularly for video conferencing (e.g., lack of background blur) and general system performance, as video decoding must now be handled by less efficient software or the CPU's general-purpose cores.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a classic blend of technical curiosity and cynical resignation, with a clear consensus that this is a poor decision driven by short-sighted corporate incentives.

**Consensus & Key Insights:**
*   **The "Penny Wise, Pound Foolish" Fallacy:** The dominant theme is disbelief that reputable business laptop vendors would cripple a core feature to save a trivial amount (~$0.25 per unit). Commenters argue that the reputational damage from poor user experience (e.g., "my new Dell is worse at Teams than my old one") will far outweigh the minor cost savings.
*   **The Incentive Structure is Broken:** Several insightful comments explain *why* this happens. It's a classic case of misaligned incentives: a product manager or procurement officer gets a bonus for hitting cost-reduction targets (e.g., saving $2.4M on a million-unit run), while the resulting user experience degradation is someone else's problem (e.g., customer support, brand reputation).
*   **The Licensing System is a Mess:** There's significant frustration with the HEVC patent licensing system. Commenters point out the "double-dipping" issue, where Intel/AMD already pay for the silicon capability, yet OEMs are still forced to pay separate fees. This is contrasted with the older H.264, which is largely patent-free now, and the hope for royalty-free codecs like AV1/AV2.
*   **It's Not a Full Lockout:** Technically-inclined users clarify that the hardware isn't fused off. The feature is simply disabled in the OEM drivers. It can be re-enabled by installing generic Intel drivers, buying a $1 license from the Microsoft Store, or using Linux. This makes the decision feel even more arbitrary and punitive.

**Disagreements:**
*   The main disagreement is over the *scale* of the problem. Some argue that while the fee is small in isolation, the cumulative cost of all such licenses (Windows, HDMI, H.264, etc.) becomes significant and justifies the "value engineering." The majority, however, see this as a slippery slope argument that fails to justify crippling a key feature on premium hardware.

**Tone:**
The overall tone is one of weary cynicism. It's the familiar lament of engineers and informed users watching large corporations systematically degrade product quality for marginal, short-term financial gains, with the consequences being passed on to the consumer.

## [California DMV approves map increase in Waymo driverless operations](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/waymo-approved-areas-of-operation-for-driverless-testing-and-deployment/)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46009994

> **Article:** The linked document is an official DMV approval notice from the state of California. It grants Waymo permission to expand its "driverless" (no safety driver) testing and commercial deployment zones. The core of the document is a set of maps detailing the specific geographic boundaries where Waymo vehicles are legally permitted to operate without a human backup driver. This is a regulatory milestone, not a technical one, representing the bureaucratic green light for further scaling.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mix of genuine excitement, pragmatic skepticism, and philosophical debate about the state of autonomous vehicles (AVs).

**Consensus & Sentiment:**
There is a palpable sense that AVs, specifically Waymo, have crossed a threshold from "promising tech demo" to "functional service." The prevailing sentiment is optimistic, with users sharing positive anecdotal experiences that contrast Waymo's reliability with the inconsistency of human-driven ride-sharing (e.g., cancellations, cleanliness). The "it just works" narrative is strong among those who have used the service.

**Key Disagreements & Insights:**

1.  **The "Allow List" vs. "Blanket Approval" Debate:** A central point of contention is the geofenced nature of the expansion. Some users express frustration that approval is a slow, map-by-map process, arguing that if the tech works, it should be allowed everywhere. More technically literate commenters counter that this is a regulatory necessity: manufacturers must prove readiness (mapping, administrative plans, etc.) for specific, diverse environments, and "everywhere" is not a uniform domain.

2.  **The Economics of AV Taxis:** A crucial reality check is injected into the "cheap rides" hype. One commenter breaks down the true cost of operation, arguing that current AV pricing is already near the floor, factoring in insurance, maintenance, cleaning, and the high capital cost of the vehicles. The insight is that AVs are unlikely to become a "cheap" daily commute replacement anytime soon, as their operational costs are fundamentally higher than personal car ownership for many.

3.  **Governance & Scalability:** The expansion is framed as a win for state-level regulation over fragmented municipal politics. The argument is that a single, tech-forward state authority can override local "luddite" vetoes, enabling progress that would be deadlocked at the city level.

4.  **Competition & The "Enshittification" Cycle:** Users note that competition (like Tesla's robotaxi ambitions) is a key driver of Waymo's aggressive rollout. However, a cynical counterpoint warns that Waymo's current quality is a temporary "honeymoon phase" of a new service, and that "enshittification" (declining quality for profit) will eventually set in, just as it did for Uber.

In short, the discussion reflects a community that is technically impressed and increasingly willing to use the product, but remains grounded in the economic and regulatory realities of scaling a complex hardware/software service.

## [Making a Small RPG](https://jslegenddev.substack.com/p/making-a-small-rpg)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46004293

> **Article:** The linked article is a tutorial on building a small-scale Role-Playing Game (RPG) using JavaScript. It details the author's development process, likely focusing on a specific game engine or framework—identified in the comments as Kaplay (formerly Kaboom.js). The article appears to cover practical aspects of game creation, such as managing game logic and potentially offering tips on pixel art for programmers who lack formal art skills. The goal is to guide readers through creating a functional, albeit small, RPG project.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mixed bag of genuine engagement, minor confusion, and tool recommendations.

*   **Tooling & Resources:** The primary technical focus is on the game engine. Commenters express interest in **Kaplay (Kaboom.js)** for its unique approach, while others mention alternatives like **Phaser** and **Love2D**. A significant sub-thread offers asset resources for non-artists, specifically recommending the **Liberated Pixel Cup** assets and **Kenney's** game asset packs.
*   **Confusion & Humor:** A notable portion of the thread is sidetracked by the acronym "RPG," with several users initially assuming it referred to a "Rocket-Propelled Grenade" rather than a "Role-Playing Game," leading to jokes about military hardware.
*   **Scope & Expectations:** There is a consensus that a 2D sprite-based project is a manageable scope for a solo developer over a few months. However, one commenter notes that attempting a "3D version" would explode the project's complexity and timeline, making it incompatible with the "small project" premise.
*   **Nostalgia & Genre:** Some users express a desire for tutorials that replicate the mechanics of classic RPGs like *Dragon Quest*, indicating a specific interest in the underlying systems (data structures, quest tracking) rather than just the visual presentation.

Overall, the community views the article as a helpful entry point for indie devs, but the conversation quickly pivots to sharing the "toolkit" (engines/assets) needed to actually execute such a project.

## [LAPD helicopter tracker with real-time operating costs](https://lapdhelicoptertracker.com/)
**Score:** 241 | **Comments:** 304 | **ID:** 46009591

> **Article:** The linked site is a public-facing, real-time map tracking LAPD helicopter positions, overlaying their operational costs. It calculates the expense in real-time based on the publicly stated hourly operating cost of approximately $2,916 per flight hour. The project appears to be a transparency tool designed to visualize the cumulative financial burn rate of the city's air support division as helicopters patrol the city.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a classic Hacker News collision of technical critique, fiscal analysis, and policy debate. There is no consensus, but rather a split between pragmatic law enforcement support and civil liberties/fiscal concerns.

**Key Themes & Disagreements:**

1.  **The "Why" vs. The "How":**
    *   **Technical:** Users immediately critiqued the UI (ads obscuring content) and reliability (Safari rendering issues). There was strong interest in the data sources, which were quickly sourced by the community to the LA City Controller.
    *   **Tactical:** A major debate erupted over the necessity of helicopters versus modern alternatives. Many argued that drones are cheaper, quieter, and safer. However, others countered that LA's unique high-speed chase culture requires manned air support, and that drones lack the endurance or payload for these specific (and frequent) scenarios.

2.  **Fiscal & Social Impact:**
    *   **Waste vs. Cost:** One camp viewed the ~$46M annual program as government bloat, especially given an audit cited that 61% of flight time was for low-priority tasks (transport, patrols).
    *   **Justification:** The opposing view attempted to normalize the cost, calculating it to roughly "a can of coke per person per month," or arguing that it's a drop in the bucket compared to the $300M+ the city spends on police misconduct lawsuits.

3.  **Surveillance & Competence:**
    *   **Privacy:** A minority raised concerns about the normalization of constant aerial surveillance, questioning if the "safety" trade-off is worth it.
    *   **Competence:** Anecdotal evidence suggested the pilots (often patrol officers trained later in life) are inexperienced, citing instances of them "drawing dicks in the sky" or losing suspects in simple maneuvers.

**Summary:**
The community treated the project as a springboard to debate the efficacy and ethics of the LAPD's air fleet. While the tool itself was viewed as a neat transparency hack, the underlying sentiment was cynical: the helicopters are expensive, potentially overused for non-critical tasks, and a symptom of a broader systemic dysfunction (including massive lawsuit payouts) that a map can highlight but not solve.

## [It's hard to build an oscillator](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/its-hard-to-build-an-oscillator)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46002161

> **Article:** The article, titled "It's hard to build an oscillator," argues that creating a *stable, predictable, and reliable* oscillator is a significant engineering challenge, far beyond the simple textbook diagrams. It likely walks through common, naive attempts at building oscillators (e.g., simple amplifier feedback loops) and demonstrates how they fail in practice due to issues like insufficient gain, incorrect phase shift, or lack of amplitude control. The piece implicitly contrasts the theoretical ease of the concept with the practical difficulties of real-world implementation, such as managing non-linear behavior, temperature sensitivity, and ensuring consistent startup. It's a piece on the subtle art of analog circuit design, highlighting the gap between academic theory and functional hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely refutes the article's premise with a mix of pedantry, practical examples, and historical context. The consensus is that building *an* oscillator is trivial, but building a *good* one is the real challenge.

Key points of disagreement and insight:
*   **"It's Actually Easy":** The top-voted comment immediately provides a three-part recipe for a relaxation oscillator (a Schmitt-trigger inverter, a resistor, and a capacitor), calling the article's premise misleading. Others echo this, stating that simple LC or RC oscillators are straightforward to get working.
*   **The Real Challenge is Stability:** The counter-argument, which serves as the discussion's core insight, is that the difficulty lies not in achieving oscillation, but in making it stable, predictable, and resistant to environmental factors like temperature, voltage fluctuations, and physical strain. This is where the real engineering "art" lies.
*   **Modern vs. Classic Approaches:** Several comments note that modern engineers simply use integrated clock generators (like the SI5351) or GPS-disciplined oscillators (GPSDOs) and "call it a day," sidestepping the analog design problem entirely.
*   **Anecdotes and Humor:** The discussion is rich with classic engineering lore, such as the joke that "amplifiers oscillate and oscillators don't," and the origin story of Hewlett-Packard. A particularly notable comment details a user's programmatic discovery of 12 distinct LC oscillator topologies, effectively "solving" the search space and demonstrating that the fundamental building blocks are well-understood.
*   **Domain-Specific Nuance:** In the context of music synthesizers, the challenge shifts again to achieving a linear 1-volt-per-octave response and managing temperature drift, a different but related problem of stability.

In essence, the community's take is that the article's title is clickbait; the real engineering is in the details of stability and performance, not in making the circuit go "buzz."

## [FAWK: LLMs can write a language interpreter](https://martin.janiczek.cz/2025/11/21/fawk-llms-can-write-a-language-interpreter.html)
**Score:** 230 | **Comments:** 189 | **ID:** 46003144

> **Article:** The article, "FAWK: LLMs can write a language interpreter," documents an experiment where the author used Large Language Models to generate an interpreter for a custom, AWK-like language named "fawk". The project serves as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that modern LLMs are capable of handling the complex, structured logic required for language interpretation, moving beyond simple boilerplate generation. The author provides a link to the GitHub repository containing the LLM-generated interpreter code and example scripts, framing the work as a demonstration of LLMs' advanced coding capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a split between those impressed by the LLM's capability and those questioning the project's practical value and rigor. The core debate centers on the purpose of using AI for such a task.

A significant portion of commenters are skeptical, arguing that the project lacks a tangible output (a working demo) and that the effort would be better spent by the developer learning to write the interpreter manually, which would yield a deeper understanding. There's a recurring sentiment that using an LLM to generate code you don't fully comprehend defeats the purpose of a personal project.

Conversely, other users defend the approach, framing it as a "fun" exploration of new technology and a way to offload tedious implementation details to focus on the conceptual design. They see it as a valid use of AI to accelerate development, even if the resulting code isn't perfect.

The conversation also branches into related topics:
*   **Alternatives:** One commenter argues that existing languages like Ruby or Perl are already superior, more feature-rich replacements for AWK, making the creation of a new AWK-like tool redundant.
*   **Shared Experience:** Several users share their own successful experiments with LLMs for complex coding tasks, such as rewriting parsers or solving algorithmic problems, lending credibility to the underlying idea that LLMs can handle non-trivial logic.

Ultimately, there is no consensus. The discussion highlights a philosophical divide on the role of AI in software development: is it a tool for augmentation and exploration, or a crutch that inhibits fundamental learning and produces suboptimal results?

## [McDonald's is losing its low-income customers](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-16/mcdonalds-is-losing-its-low-income-customers)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 571 | **ID:** 46006848

> **Article:** The linked article reports that McDonald's is experiencing a significant decline in patronage from its traditional low-income customer base. The core thesis is that a combination of factors—including post-pandemic inflation, rising labor costs, and global supply chain disruptions—has driven menu prices to a point where the brand is no longer perceived as an affordable option. The article uses anecdotal evidence, such as a nurse struggling with the cost of a few beverages, to illustrate the financial pressure on consumers who once relied on the chain for cheap meals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a textbook example of a circular economic debate, lacking consensus and driven by ideological priors. The primary disagreement centers on the root cause of inflation:

*   **Monetary vs. Corporate Greed:** One faction argues that inflation is a direct result of monetary policy (e.g., stimulus checks, money supply expansion), causing the value of the dollar to fall and prices to rise. The opposing view posits that corporations, protected by market consolidation ("a small handful of companies"), are using inflation as a pretext for price-gouging to expand profit margins, which some commenters noted have doubled for McDonald's over the last two decades.
*   **Labor Costs:** A secondary debate revolves around the impact of rising wages. Some argue that minimum wage hikes and tight labor markets have created "wage-push inflation," pricing low-income consumers out of the service economy. Others counter that executive compensation and stock buybacks are the real culprits, not the "burger flipper wanting enough money to make it worthwhile to leave their house."

Beyond the economic causality arguments, there is broad agreement on the secondary effects. Many commenters noted a tangible decline in the McDonald's customer experience, citing slower service (due to delivery integration), cold food, and an unwelcoming atmosphere. There is also a shared skepticism about the article's premise that this shift will lead to healthier eating habits; the consensus is that time and energy poverty make cheap, processed food at home more likely than a balanced diet.

In essence, the discussion is a microcosm of the broader political discourse: a stalemate between blaming macroeconomic policy, corporate malfeasance, and labor dynamics, with a side order of universal agreement that the product itself has degraded.

## [How Cops Are Using Flock's ALPR Network to Surveil Protesters and Activists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/how-cops-are-using-flock-safetys-alpr-network-surveil-protesters-and-activists)
**Score:** 217 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46006521

> **Article:** The linked article, published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), details how Flock Safety's Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) network is being leveraged by law enforcement for purposes beyond its stated goal of solving property crime. Specifically, it alleges that police are using this pervasive surveillance infrastructure to track attendees of protests and activists, effectively creating a database of political expression. The article frames this as a "mission creep" where a tool sold for finding stolen cars becomes a mechanism for monitoring constitutionally protected activity, highlighting the risks of a privately-owned, police-accessible panopticon.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a fairly standard mix of privacy advocacy, pedantic corrections, and pragmatic debate. There is a general consensus that the widespread deployment of ALPRs is a significant privacy concern, but the conversation quickly splinters.

Key insights and disagreements include:
*   **Mission Creep is the Core Issue:** The primary concern isn't just the technology, but its application. The example of a "missing person" search being used to investigate an abortion in Texas is cited as a prime example of how vague justifications can mask politically or personally motivated surveillance.
*   **Technical and Practical Realities:** Several users correct the article's premise. One highly upvoted comment points out that ALPRs track *cars*, not *people*, and that many protesters arrive via other means. Another dismisses the idea of "adversarial bumper stickers," clarifying that the "AI" involved is simple OCR, not a natural language model that can be "instructed" to forget data.
*   **The Public vs. Private Debate:** A recurring point of contention is whether these systems are a public or private threat. One user argues they are primarily state-operated, while another counters that private enterprise (like Flock) is the key enabler, creating a public-private surveillance partnership.
*   **Counter-Narratives on Crime:** Not all discussion is anti-ALPR. One user presents a real-world scenario where community-funded Flock cameras reduced crime in their neighborhood, suggesting the technology is a rational response to perceived lawlessness, even if it has dystopian side effects.
*   **Apathy and Action:** The tone ranges from cynical resignation ("This country is so flocked") to calls for direct civic action (attending city council meetings). The moderation note to "dang" suggests the discussion is being kept within the bounds of technical and policy debate, preventing it from devolving purely into political outrage.

Overall, the discussion acknowledges the threat but argues over the specifics: how the technology works, who controls it, whether its benefits outweigh its costs, and what, if anything, can be done about it.
