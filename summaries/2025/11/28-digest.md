# HN Daily Digest - 2025-11-28

PocketBase topped the charts today, offering an open-source backend in a single executable that bundles SQLite, real-time APIs, and an admin UI. Hacker News hailed it as a "Supabase-lite" for rapid prototyping, though the "single file" claim sparked pedantry—it’s a compiled binary, not monolithic source. Real-world users praised its stability but griped about a clunky mobile admin UI and buggy real-time features, while Rust-based alternative TrailBase got a nod for custom JavaScript endpoints.  

The EU Council’s "Chat Control" mandate ignited fury, with critics decrying it as a surveillance trojan horse that forces encrypted message scanning under "voluntary" pretenses. HN regulars were cynical about the political loophole, advocating decentralized tools like SimpleX, and debated Denmark’s role versus Germany’s privacy culture. The thread also veered into UK comparisons and moderation drama, with users alleging shadowbanning of past threads.  

A petition to recognize open-source work as civic service in Germany divided HN. While FOSS as public good resonated, German bureaucracy—requiring non-profit sponsors—made it seem unworkable. Critics warned it could subsidize tech giants exploiting the system, while others highlighted the near-impossible path to charitable status for FOSS projects.
