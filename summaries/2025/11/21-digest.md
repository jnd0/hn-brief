# HN Daily Digest - 2025-11-21

The most significant story today isn't about a shiny new product, but about the unglamorous plumbing that makes modern computing possible. Valve, through Igalia, has been quietly paying to fix Qualcomm's Adreno GPU drivers for Linux, specifically optimizing Mesa's Turnip Vulkan driver and crafting a custom kernel scheduler to deliver low-latency gaming on ARM devices. This is a masterclass in corporate self-interest masquerading as community stewardship. Valve isn't just being a "good citizen"—it's ensuring it isn't locked into x86 when ARM inevitably dominates mobile, and it's building the foundation for a future ARM-based Steam Deck. The real story here is that hardware vendors like Qualcomm continue to treat Linux support as a rounding error, forcing the community to reverse-engineer critical infrastructure from scratch. It's the same old tale: corporations externalize their R&D costs onto the open-source ecosystem, then get praised for "contributing."

This pattern of thankless infrastructure work is the thread connecting much of today's digest. Igalia's reputation is built on these invisible contributions, from WebKit to Mesa, yet the discussion around their kernel scheduler reveals a familiar tension. One camp argues Valve reinvented the wheel by ignoring existing community solutions like the BORE scheduler, while others defend the move as rigorous upstream contribution rather than a niche fork. The truth is, both are right. Valve's approach is more academically pure, but it also reflects how corporate funding inevitably shapes open-source development: they'll pay for what they need, not necessarily what's already available.

The open-source theme continues with Wealthfolio 2.0, an investment tracker that embodies the eternal privacy-versus-convenience tradeoff. The project is polished and self-hosted, a noble alternative to commercial fintech, but the comments expose the core problem: users love the idea of keeping their data local but are unwilling to give up automated bank syncing. It's a classic engineer's dilemma—build something technically superior that nobody will use because it's too much work, or accept the friction of manual entry. The author's suggestion of optional aggregator integration is a pragmatic band-aid, but it won't solve the fundamental mismatch between privacy ideals and user laziness.

Then there's OLMo 3, Ai2's "fully open" 32B model, which is being hyped as the best in its class. The community is rightly skeptical. "Best" is doing a lot of work when the pool of truly open models is small, and the real-world utility is questionable. Users quickly pointed out that for daily tasks, speed trumps raw capability, and models like Qwen3-30B are "fast enough." The OLMoTrace feature, meant to show training data influence, drew particular fire for being misleading—it finds n-grams, not true attribution, a distinction the Ai2 researcher had to clarify. It's a reminder that "open" is often a marketing term, and the devil is in the implementation details.

Meanwhile, the "because we can" engineering mindset is on full display with the PS2 JavaScript project. Using Fabrice Bellard's QuickJS to write games for a 25-year-old console is a brilliant hack, but the discussion quickly pivots to practicality. Running homebrew on real hardware is trivial with a memory card exploit; the disc-burning angle is pure nostalgia. The real insight here is that modern consoles are *harder* to hack for this kind of experimentation due to lack of JIT support and closed SDKs. The PS2, ironically, is more accessible than a Switch for low-level tinkering.

That same gap between theory and practice haunts the Half-Life 2 "time-travelling door" bug, a classic floating-point determinism issue. The discussion is a nostalgia trip for engineers who've battled the x87 FPU's 80-bit internal precision. It's not a new problem—Team Fortress 2 had similar issues—but it's a perfect example of how tiny, non-deterministic math differences can cascade into game-breaking divergence. The pedantic debate over whether HL2 doors are "physics objects" misses the point: the Source Engine's history is littered with these ghosts.

The oscillator article is another case study in this divide. The title claims it's "hard" to build an oscillator, but the comments immediately refute it: it's trivial to make one oscillate. The real challenge, as any analog engineer knows, is making it *stable*—resistant to temperature, voltage, and the non-linear realities of hardware. The discussion is a goldmine of classic lore: "amplifiers oscillate, oscillators don't," the origin of HP, and the modern reality that most engineers just buy an integrated clock generator and call it a day.

On the geopolitical front, the French judge story is a stark reminder of US financial hegemony. A single ICC judge is digitally exiled—frozen assets, severed payment systems—because the US disagrees with his court's warrants. The EU's proposed "blocking regulation" is a legal fig leaf; everyone knows it's a bluff that would risk critical US support for Ukraine. The discussion is pragmatic, not outraged: this is how power works. The only real countermeasure is decentralization, which is why the crypto crowd sees this as vindication.

That surveillance creep is mirrored in the Flock ALPR story, where police use license plate readers to track protesters. The debate here is nuanced. Some point out ALPRs track cars, not people, and that "adversarial bumper stickers" are useless against simple OCR. Others share real-world examples where community-funded Flock cameras reduced crime, creating a tension between safety and privacy. The core issue is mission creep: a tool sold for finding stolen cars becomes a political surveillance network, enabled by a public-private partnership that bypasses democratic oversight.

This crisis of institutional trust is the subtext of the personal blogs and homeschooling stories. The "revival" of blogs is a myth for anyone who isn't already in the bubble; the discovery ecosystem is broken. Search is AI-slop, social media is a walled garden, and the only real alternative is federation. Similarly, the homeschooling boom is a market-driven rejection of public schools, but the comments reveal a cynical undercurrent: a significant portion is just "sports grifting"—parents red-shirting kids for athletic advantage. The real driver is a loss of faith in institutions, whether it's education or media.

That loss of faith extends to pharmaceuticals. The Prozac study showing no better than placebo for kids has commenters split between "it saved my life" testimonials and clinical skepticism. The most insightful take is that the drug works for severe, endogenous depression but fails in the diluted, over-prescribed population. It's a reminder that population-level statistics erase individual outcomes, and that the chemical imbalance theory is a blunt instrument.

Meanwhile, McDonald's losing low-income customers is a perfect microcosm of the inflation debate. One camp blames monetary policy and wage-push inflation; the other sees corporate price-gouging and margin expansion. The reality is both are true, but the real story is the degradation of the product itself—slower service, cold food, a hostile experience. The "it's cheaper to eat at home" narrative is also naive: time and energy poverty make processed food the rational choice.

The Waymo expansion is the final piece of the puzzle. The regulatory approval is a milestone, but the discussion quickly grounds it in economic reality. AVs are unlikely to be "cheap" anytime soon; the operational costs (insurance, maintenance, cleaning) are high. The debate over geofencing vs. blanket approval reveals a fundamental tension: regulators need proof of readiness for specific environments, but that slows deployment to a crawl. The "it just works" anecdotes are compelling, but the economics suggest this is a premium service, not a mass-market replacement.

Finally, the ultrasound smell story is a classic "cool demo, now what?" moment. The technical feasibility is interesting, but the practical engineering challenges (miniaturization, safety) are immense. The discussion quickly devolves into dystopian speculation: weaponization, "scented" adult content, and the terrifying idea of "write access" to the brain. It's a perfect capstone to the day's themes: brilliant engineering, questionable applications, and a public that's increasingly cynical about who gets to control the tech.

**Worth watching:** The EU's response to the US sanctions against the ICC judge. If they activate the blocking regulation, it could be the first real crack in the US-controlled financial system, with massive implications for tech and trade.
