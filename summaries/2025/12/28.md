> **Article:** The article links to a web tool called "Calendar" by Neatnik. It generates a minimalist, single-page calendar for an entire year (e.g., 2026). The primary purpose appears to be for printing and use as a physical planner or habit tracker. The tool is customizable via URL parameters, allowing users to change the year, switch to an "aligned-weekdays" layout where days are stacked vertically, and highlight weekends (or Fridays/Saturdays for some cultures).
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to the tool, praising its clean design and utility for physical habit tracking. The discussion focused on a few key areas:
*   **Usability & UI:** Users pointed out a usability issue where a modal covers the calendar, making it difficult to see before printing. There was also a suggestion to spell out day names for clarity.
*   **Features & Customization:** Users discovered and shared URL parameters for different layouts (`aligned-weekdays`) and cultural adaptations, specifically a `sofshavua=1` option that highlights Friday and Saturday instead of the standard weekend.
*   **Alternatives & Extensions:** One user mentioned `recalendar.js` as a similar tool for e-ink devices. Several users requested additional features, such as monthly or quarterly views, to which one commenter suggested using an AI to modify the page's source code.

## [Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/27/)
**Score:** 661 | **Comments:** 248 | **ID:** 46407337

> **Article:** The article "Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML" argues for using modern, native HTML elements to achieve common interactive UI patterns, reducing the need for JavaScript. It provides practical examples for features like accordions (`<details>`/`<summary>`), autocomplete suggestions (`<datalist>`), and popovers (`<popover>`). The core message is to leverage the platform's built-in capabilities first, which leads to simpler, more robust, and more accessible code before reaching for complex frameworks or custom scripts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely supportive of the article's premise but highlights significant practical challenges. Key points include:
*   **Styling and Browser Inconsistency:** A major critique is that native HTML elements (like `<datalist>` and `<select>`) are notoriously difficult to style consistently across different browsers, making them unsuitable for polished, commercial projects that require a specific look and feel.
*   **Limited Functionality:** While great for simple cases, native elements often lack advanced features. For example, `<datalist>` doesn't allow for complex filtering or displaying non-matching but relevant suggestions.
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** Many commenters praise the approach for its resilience. Even if a feature doesn't work perfectly, the underlying element often remains functional, which is a huge advantage over JavaScript implementations that can fail completely.
*   **Developer Experience vs. Power:** A sub-thread debated the trade-offs, with some arguing that JavaScript offers a superior development experience for complex logic (loops, state management) compared to writing verbose HTML/CSS, while others see the current "return to HTML" as a correction to the over-engineering of the JS-heavy frontend world.
*   **Future Outlook:** Commenters are hopeful about upcoming standards like a customizable `<select>` element, which could solve the styling issue that plagues many of these native components.

## [Last Year on My Mac: Look Back in Disbelief](https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/28/last-year-on-my-mac-look-back-in-disbelief/)
**Score:** 395 | **Comments:** 302 | **ID:** 46409969

> **Article:** Users are reacting to the latest Apple operating system updates (macOS "Tahoe" 26 and iOS 26), widely panning the new "Liquid Glass" design language. The consensus is that the update prioritizes flashy, translucent visual effects over usability, leading to poor readability, wasted screen space, and constant fan noise on laptops. Many long-time users are expressing frustration and considering switching to Linux, feeling the OS has become an "abomination" that prioritizes marketing over user experience.
>
> **Discussion:** Key discussion points focus on the severe usability regressions in the new "Liquid Glass" UI. Users criticize the design as "sloppy," "crispness-lacking," and "Fisher-Price-like," citing excessive whitespace, low contrast, and distracting animations that hinder productivity. There is significant anger over forced upgrades that disrupted workflows, broken settings search, and the perception that Apple is sacrificing the Mac's utility for a unified, VisionOS-inspired aesthetic that no one asked for.

## [Fathers’ choices may be packaged and passed down in sperm RNA](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-dads-fitness-may-be-packaged-and-passed-down-in-sperm-rna-20251222/)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 173 | **ID:** 46407502

> **Article:** The article from Quanta Magazine explores the emerging field of paternal epigenetic inheritance, specifically how a father's lifestyle and environmental exposures can be passed down to his children via RNA molecules in sperm. It challenges the traditional Mendelian view that only DNA sequences are inherited from the father. The piece details research, primarily in mice, showing that paternal experiences like stress, diet, exercise, and exposure to toxins (e.g., nicotine) can alter the RNA payload within sperm. These RNA molecules don't change the DNA code itself but can influence how genes are expressed in the offspring, leading to observable changes in their physiology, such as altered stress responses, metabolism, or liver function. The article frames this as a way a father's "fitness" or condition can be packaged and transmitted to the next generation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters drawing immediate connections to established concepts and broader implications. Key points of discussion include:

*   **Lamarckian Evolution:** Multiple users immediately identified the research as a modern echo of Lamarckism (the inheritance of acquired characteristics), contrasting it with traditional Mendelian genetics and noting how epigenetics blurs these lines.
*   **Practical Applications & Speculation:** Commenters speculated on real-world applications, such as incorporating sperm RNA analysis into IVF fertility assessments. A recurring humorous theme was the idea of "saving" one's "best self" by freezing sperm at peak physical or mental health.
*   **Limits of Inheritance:** A nuanced debate emerged about the limits of this transmission. While most agree that general physiological states (like stress or metabolic fitness) could be passed down, there was skepticism about transmitting specific, complex subjective experiences or memories, which would require a more direct "cognition-to-biomolecular" link.
*   **Real-World Correlates:** Users cited real-world evidence to support the concept, most notably the transgenerational epigenetic effects observed in the descendants of survivors of the Dutch Hunger Winter, linking the research to tangible human history.
*   **Tone and Credibility:** The overall tone was one of interest and curiosity, with some users making jokes about optimizing their children's traits. The credibility of Quanta Magazine as a source was affirmed, and the discussion was largely grounded in scientific and philosophical context.

## [Building a macOS app to know when my Mac is thermal throttling](https://stanislas.blog/2025/12/macos-thermal-throttling-app/)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46410402

> **Article:** The article details the author's process of building a custom macOS menu bar application to detect when their Mac is thermal throttling. The motivation stemmed from observing performance drops during intensive tasks (like video encoding) where CPU wattage would decrease despite sustained high load. The author explored several methods to detect throttling, such as using `ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState` but found it buggy and unreliable. Ultimately, they built the app by directly monitoring the system's thermal pressure notifications, providing a simple, visual indicator (a fire icon) when throttling occurs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical utility of detecting thermal throttling and the broader context of Mac hardware performance. Key points include:

*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Users debated what to do once throttling is detected. For MacBooks with fans, solutions include using third-party apps like iStat Menus to create custom, more aggressive fan curves or enabling macOS's "High Power Mode." For fanless MacBook Airs, options are limited to physical cooling (elevating the device, using an external fan) or reducing workload.
*   **Alternative Tools:** Several users mentioned existing, popular menu bar utilities like `stats` (from the linked GitHub repo) or iStat Menus, which can display CPU usage and wattage, allowing users to infer throttling without a dedicated app.
*   **Hardware & Maintenance:** A significant point was the importance of cleaning dust and pet hair from Mac fans, which is a common cause of overheating and performance issues.
*   **Intel vs. Apple Silicon:** Users contrasted the poor thermal and performance experience of older Intel-based Macs (especially the 2017 models) with the significant improvements of Apple Silicon, which turned around many users' opinions of Apple hardware.
*   **Technical Bugs:** A developer confirmed a known bug where `ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState` fails to update correctly, validating the author's technical decision to use a different method for their app.

## [AI Slop Report: The Global Rise of Low-Quality AI Videos](https://www.kapwing.com/blog/ai-slop-report-the-global-rise-of-low-quality-ai-videos/)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46409125

> **Article:** The article "AI Slop Report" by Kapwing analyzes the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated videos on platforms like YouTube. It defines "AI slop" as content that is mass-produced, formulaic, and often lacks human creativity, using examples like AI-narrated documentaries, "oddly satisfying" compilations, and fake animal rescue videos. The report uses data from YouTube to show a significant rise in such content, noting that countries like Spain and India are major producers. The author argues that this trend is driven by the low cost of production and the potential for ad revenue, leading to a "race to the bottom" in content quality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the proliferation of AI-generated content and the platforms that host it. Key themes include:

*   **User Experience and Algorithm Frustration:** Many users express frustration with YouTube's recommendation algorithm, which they feel pushes low-quality, sensationalist, or AI-generated content ("disgusting cow medical procedures," "random sexual videos") even when their watch history is curated towards specific, high-quality interests like science or cooking. Users find it increasingly difficult to discover new, trustworthy content.
*   **The Nature of AI Slop:** Commenters provide examples of common AI slop, including fake animal rescue stories, AI-voiced podcasts, and deepfaked geopolitical "experts." A particularly concerning point is that these videos often have fake comments, making it hard for viewers to discern their inauthenticity.
*   **Solutions and Mitigation:** Some users claim to have a "0% AI slop" feed by either abandoning YouTube entirely for text-based sources or by aggressively using YouTube's "Not interested" and "Don't recommend channel" features. However, the consensus is that the burden of filtering is on the user.
*   **Platform Responsibility vs. Technical Feasibility:** There's a debate about whether platforms like YouTube should provide tools to block AI content. Skeptics argue that automatically detecting AI videos is technically difficult and economically unviable for the platform, which benefits from high engagement and low-cost content.
*   **The "End Game":** Some speculate on the long-term consequences, suggesting a future where AI-generated content and bot engagement create a self-sustaining ecosystem for advertisers and propagandists, effectively bypassing human audiences and word-of-mouth.
*   **Irony and Skepticism:** A few users point out the irony of the article being hosted on a platform (Kapwing) that itself offers AI video generation tools, highlighting the complex relationship between the creation and critique of AI content.

## [Liberating Bluetooth on the ESP32](https://exquisite.tube/w/mEzF442Q4hUXnhQ8HmfZuq)
**Score:** 142 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46406098

> **Article:** The article links to a video (from Chaos Communication Congress 39C3) titled "Liberating Bluetooth on the ESP32." The content details a reverse-engineering effort to replace the proprietary, closed-source Bluetooth firmware (the "radio blob") on the ESP32 microcontroller with an open-source implementation. This achievement allows developers to use Bluetooth functionality without relying on opaque binary blobs from the manufacturer (Espressif), enabling greater transparency, customization, and community control over the hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focuses on the technical significance of the project and clarifies the nature of the ESP32's open-source status. Key points include:
*   **Significance:** Commenters view the project as a major breakthrough that unlocks future potential for the ESP32 platform.
*   **Context on Openness:** Users clarify that while the ESP32's main software (ESP-IDF) is open source, the radio firmware has remained closed. This reverse-engineering effort specifically targets that remaining closed component.
*   **Correction of Assumptions:** Several users corrected a misconception that the ESP32 was previously unknown or obscure, noting it is already a very popular and largely open platform.
*   **Off-Topic Tangent:** A minor thread diverged into a user's frustration with Bluetooth audio on Linux, which led to a debate about product quality vs. price and the user's attribution of issues to Chinese manufacturing.

## [Functional programming and reliability: ADTs, safety, critical infrastructure](https://blog.rastrian.dev/post/why-reliability-demands-functional-programming-adts-safety-and-critical-infrastructure)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46406901

> **Article:** The article argues that for critical infrastructure (banking, telecom, payments), functional programming (FP) and specifically Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are essential for reliability. The core thesis is "make illegal states unrepresentable." By using strong type systems to model data precisely (e.g., explicit state machines), developers can eliminate entire classes of bugs at compile time. The author contrasts this with traditional approaches that rely on runtime checks and defensive programming, asserting that FP techniques like immutability and exhaustive pattern matching lead to safer, more maintainable systems where failures are prevented rather than just handled.

## [Hungry Fat Cells Could Someday Starve Cancer](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429411/how-hungry-fat-cells-could-someday-starve-cancer-death)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46409928

> **Article:** The article from UCSF describes research on a potential cancer treatment that works by "starving" cancer cells. The core idea is to create metabolic competition between tumors and the body's fat cells. Researchers, led by first author Anh Nguyen (who tragically passed away before the study's publication), found that genetically modifying fat cells to be "hungry" (specifically, by overexpressing the UCP1 gene to make them burn energy for heat) could significantly slow tumor growth and improve survival in mice. The study was inspired by observations that cold exposure, which turns white fat into energy-burning beige fat, also seemed to inhibit cancer growth. The ultimate goal is to develop a therapy that triggers this effect without requiring patients to endure prolonged cold exposure.

The site covers fundamental concepts, including traditional techniques, software rasterization, and ray tracing, aiming to provide a comprehensive resource for learners without the barriers of expensive books or proprietary information.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community received the resource positively, with many users expressing a shared desire to learn computer graphics fundamentals from first principles. Key discussion points include:

*   **The Difficulty of Modern APIs:** Several commenters noted that jumping directly into modern, complex APIs like Vulkan is overwhelming ("drinking from a firehose") without a solid understanding of the underlying theory. They recommended starting with software-based renderers (CPU-based) to build foundational knowledge.
*   **Alternative Learning Paths:** Users suggested other resources like "build-your-own-x" guides, the "tinyrenderer" tutorial, and using WebGPU or WebGL as more accessible entry points to modern graphics programming.
*   **Personal Anecdotes:** Many shared their own stories of wanting to become graphics programmers but getting sidetracked, often citing the complexity of tools and the intimidating learning curve.
*   **Resource Quality:** Scratchapixel was praised for its open and free approach, with one user noting the site had improved and another appreciating that the author had previously acted on community feedback to remove AI-generated thumbnails.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after 10 years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the primary maintainer of Mockito, the most popular mocking framework for Java, after 10 years. He cites burnout and the increasing difficulty of maintaining the project, particularly in light of recent changes in the Java ecosystem. A key point of friction was the introduction of JEP 451, which disallows dynamic loading of agents by default in future Java versions (starting with Java 22). This forced Mockito 5 to ship a breaking change, requiring it to be used as a pre-loaded agent, which Dutheil found was communicated dismissively by the JDK team. He also mentions the difficulties of supporting Kotlin, which has significant implementation downsides for Mockito. He concludes by alluding to the classic "xkcd 2347" problem, where a critical open-source project is maintained by a very small team.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News covers several key themes:
*   **Maintainer Burnout and OSS Sustainability:** Many commenters express sympathy, noting the immense pressure on single maintainers of critical open-source projects and the irresponsibility of downstream projects that rely on them without contributing support.
*   **The Mockito vs. Real Implementations Debate:** A sub-thread questions the need for mocking libraries in Java, with some arguing they are overused and lead to messy tests, while others defend their necessity for dealing with legacy code that isn't designed for testability.
*   **Technical Justification and JDK's "Integrity" Policy:** The core technical debate revolves around the JDK's decision to disallow dynamic agent loading. Some users question why enabling a flag isn't a sufficient solution. However, a commenter provides a detailed explanation of the JDK team's "Integrity by Default" principle, which prioritizes security and performance by ensuring that libraries cannot alter core JVM behavior without the application's explicit consent.
*   **Communication and Alternatives:** Some users critique the JDK team's communication, feeling it was dismissive of the impact on the ecosystem. Others suggest that if supporting Kotlin is too difficult, Kotlin users should switch to a Kotlin-native framework like MockK.

## [C++ says “We have try. . . finally at home”](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20251222-00/?p=111890)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46408984

> **Article:** The article, from Raymond Chen's "The Old New Thing" blog, uses a popular meme format ("We have X at home") to explain a C++ concept. The title "C++ says 'We have try...finally at home'" implies that C++ already has a mechanism equivalent to the `try...finally` block found in languages like Java or C#. This mechanism is the C++ destructor, which is the foundation of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom. The core idea is that an object's destructor is automatically called when it goes out of scope, guaranteeing cleanup (like closing a file or releasing a lock) regardless of how the scope is exited (normal execution, early return, or an exception).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the comparison between C++'s RAII/destructor model and the explicit `try...finally` or `defer` constructs found in other languages. Key points include:

*   **RAII vs. `finally`:** Many commenters argued that RAII is superior because it's less verbose, avoids nested blocks, and makes resource management automatic and tied to object lifetime, reducing the chance of human error. However, some countered that destructors and `finally` serve different purposes (ownership vs. operation-scoped cleanup) and that RAII requires the boilerplate of creating a class.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Users highlighted Swift's `defer` as a more universal and flexible solution that isn't tied to exceptions. The discussion also touched on how similar functionality can be achieved in Rust and even C++ itself using macros.
*   **Error Handling Nuances:** A significant sub-thread focused on error handling. One commenter argued that the primary flaw in `try...finally` implementations (in Java, Python, etc.) is that an exception in the `finally` block can overwrite the original, more important exception. Another pointed out that C++'s solution (terminating the program if a destructor throws during stack unwinding) is even worse.
*   **Readability and Pitfalls:** The complexity and "readability" of C++ syntax was a recurring theme, with some finding it unreadable and others defending it. The potential for destructors to throw exceptions and cause program termination was highlighted as a major footgun.

## [Dialtone – AOL 3.0 Server](https://dialtone.live/)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46408192

> **Article:** The article links to "Dialtone," a project that emulates the AOL 3.0 server and user experience. It aims to recreate the "internet we lost" by allowing users to connect to a simulated AOL environment, featuring a custom client, chat, and even emulated applications like the Mac emulator mentioned in the comments. The project serves as a nostalgia-driven preservation effort of the walled-garden online service era.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is divided between nostalgia for the AOL era and critical analysis of its legacy. While many users express excitement about the preservation effort and reminisce about specific features like AIM and "You've Got Mail," others challenge the romanticized view of AOL. Commenters argue that AOL was actually a precursor to the centralized, "walled garden" internet that big tech is building today, rather than the open, chaotic "real internet" it is often mistaken for. Technical details were also discussed, such as how AOL functioned as an ISP and the specific mechanics of the "keyword" search system. There was also debate regarding the project's lack of open-source code, with some users arguing it is essential for long-term preservation.

## [The Dangers of SSL Certificates](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/12/27/the-dangers-of-ssl-certificates/)
**Score:** 84 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46406129

> **Article:** The article "The Dangers of SSL Certificates" argues that SSL/TLS certificate expiration is a unique and dangerous operational risk. Unlike most software failures that result from code changes, certificate failures are caused by the simple passage of time. The author uses an anecdote about the Bazel project, where an automated renewal failed and the alert system also broke, leading to a sudden, catastrophic outage with no graceful degradation. The core problem is that there is no natural signal to operators that a certificate is expiring until it is too late, and the failure is binary: everything works one minute, and everything fails the next.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but focuses on solutions and best practices to prevent such outages. The key consensus is that relying on a single automated process and its associated alerts is insufficient. The most critical points are:

*   **Proactive, External Monitoring:** Multiple commenters stress the need for independent monitoring that checks certificate expiration dates from the outside. This is crucial because the renewal client itself might fail silently, or a new certificate might not be properly loaded by the server. Simple scripts or dedicated tools (like Prometheus' `ssl_exporter`) are recommended.
*   **Defense in Depth:** A single point of failure is risky. Suggestions include having multiple overlapping certificates (e.g., RSA and ECC) and setting up canary deployments that serve a small percentage of traffic with a near-expired certificate to trigger alerts before a full outage.
*   **Operational Awareness:** The problem is often one of inventory and process. Teams don't always know where all their certificates are (e.g., in containers, VM images, different services), making comprehensive monitoring difficult.
*   **Debate on Risk:** While most see short certificate lifespans as a necessary security measure, some argue that for personal sites, the risk of an outage from expiration outweighs the privacy benefits, suggesting a dual HTTP/HTTPS approach. However, this is a controversial and minority opinion.
*   **Terminology:** A minor point of contention was the use of "SSL" versus "TLS," with one user pointing out the technical inaccuracy but acknowledging the term's persistence.
