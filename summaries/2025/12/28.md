**Score:** 916 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46408613

> **Article:** The article links to a web tool called "Calendar" by Neatnik. It generates a minimalist, single-page calendar for an entire year (default is the current year, but can be specified, e.g., 2026). The primary purpose is for printing and use as a physical planner or habit tracker. The design is clean and compact, showing all 12 months on one page. It supports URL parameters for customization, such as `year`, `layout=aligned-weekdays` (to align days of the week vertically), and `sofshavua=1` to highlight Fridays and Saturdays (for cultures where the weekend starts on Friday).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the tool's clean design and utility for habit tracking and planning. Key points include:
*   **Praise:** Users appreciate the minimalist, one-page layout, finding it ideal for physical printing and tracking habits like gym visits or reading.
*   **Feedback & Suggestions:** Several suggestions were made, including adding an option for quarterly views, creating per-month pages, and improving the UI (e.g., adding a way to hide a modal before printing).
*   **Usability Issues:** One user pointed out a UI issue where a modal blocks the calendar, making it hard to see before printing. Another user suggested adding a full letter to the day-of-the-week abbreviations for clarity.
*   **Customization & Features:** Users discovered and shared various URL parameters for customization, such as highlighting different weekend days (`sofshavua=1`) and using the `aligned-weekdays` layout.
*   **Alternatives:** A user mentioned `recalendar.js` as an alternative for creating reMarkable tablet calendars.

## [Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/27/)
**Score:** 665 | **Comments:** 250 | **ID:** 46407337

> **Article:** The article "Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML" argues for using modern, native HTML elements to handle common interactive patterns instead of immediately reaching for JavaScript frameworks. It showcases several examples, such as using `<details>` and `<summary>` for accordions, `<datalist>` for autocomplete suggestions, and the Popover API for tooltips and modals. The core message is that these built-in browser features provide significant functionality (including accessibility) out-of-the-box, leading to simpler, more robust, and more performant code.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but highlights significant practical challenges. Key points include:

*   **The "It Depends" Reality:** While the HTML-first approach is praised for simplicity and accessibility, many commenters point out its limitations. The `<datalist>` element is criticized for being inflexible and inconsistently styled across browsers, often forcing developers to build custom JS solutions anyway.
*   **Styling and Customization:** A major recurring theme is the difficulty of styling native HTML elements (like `<select>` or `<details>`) to match a specific design. This is seen as a primary reason why component libraries and JS-based alternatives are so popular in commercial projects.
*   **Progressive Enhancement:** The philosophy is well-received. Commenters appreciate that even if these native features don't work perfectly in all browsers or designs, they often "fail gracefully" and remain functional, unlike many JS-dependent implementations which can fail completely.
*   **Developer Experience vs. Power:** One thread debates the developer experience, comparing the simplicity of HTML/CSS to the power and flexibility of a full programming language like JavaScript. The industry's cyclical nature (moving from server-side rendering to SPAs and back towards server-centric interactivity with HTMX, Hotwire, etc.) is also discussed.

## [Last Year on My Mac: Look Back in Disbelief](https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/28/last-year-on-my-mac-look-back-in-disbelief/)
**Score:** 398 | **Comments:** 305 | **ID:** 46409969

> **Article:** The article reports on the overwhelmingly negative user reaction to Apple's latest software update, codenamed "Tahoe" (macOS 26) and featuring the "Liquid Glass" design language. Users describe the update as a usability disaster, criticizing its excessive whitespace, low-contrast elements, oversized controls, and poor readability. The design is widely condemned as a regression that prioritizes flashy, slow animations over functional efficiency, with many comparing it unfavorably to Windows Vista. The update is also blamed for increased resource consumption, causing Mac fans to run constantly, and for forced upgrades that disrupted professional workflows. The sentiment is so strong that it has prompted long-time Apple users to consider switching to Linux.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by intense frustration with the new "Liquid Glass" UI, which users find ugly, inefficient, and a significant step backward in usability. Key complaints focus on the loss of "crispness" and information density, with the new design described as "sloppy," "childish," and a constant hindrance to productivity. Many speculate that the design is a misguided attempt to make macOS resemble visionOS for the Apple Vision Pro. The poor reception of the update has led to widespread recommendations to avoid it, and some users are expressing a desire to switch to Linux or hold onto old hardware indefinitely. There is a strong consensus that Apple is no longer listening to its power users and is sacrificing usability for the sake of making visible, and ultimately detrimental, changes.

## [Fathers’ choices may be packaged and passed down in sperm RNA](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-dads-fitness-may-be-packaged-and-passed-down-in-sperm-rna-20251222/)
**Score:** 285 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46407502

> **Article:** The article from Quanta Magazine explores the emerging field of epigenetics, specifically how a father's lifestyle and experiences can be passed down to his offspring through RNA molecules in sperm, rather than through changes to the DNA sequence itself. This challenges the traditional Mendelian view of genetics. The article cites experiments showing that male mice exposed to specific stimuli—such as nicotine, specific scents, or even a traumatic fear response—produce offspring with altered traits. For example, nicotine-exposed fathers had pups whose livers were better at metabolizing toxins, and fear-conditioned fathers passed down a heightened startle response. This heritable information is carried not by genes, but by small RNA molecules and other epigenetic markers that can influence gene expression in the developing embryo.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely fascinated and speculative, with several key themes emerging:

*   **Lamarckian Evolution:** Many commenters immediately drew parallels to Lamarckism (the inheritance of acquired characteristics), noting that this research provides a biological mechanism for a concept once considered debunked. The discussion acknowledges that while genetics is predominantly Mendelian, epigenetics introduces a durable, Lamarckian-like layer of inheritance.

*   **Practical and Futuristic Implications:** Users speculated on the potential applications of this science. One popular idea was "sperm banking" or "save-scumming," where a man freezes his sperm at different life stages (e.g., "peak fitness") to preserve the epigenetic benefits of that period. Others humorously discussed optimizing their health before conception to give their children an edge.

*   **Limits of Inheritance:** A more nuanced thread debated the limits of this phenomenon. One commenter argued that while general states like stress, fitness, or diet could plausibly be transmitted via molecular signals, it's highly unlikely that specific subjective experiences or fears (e.g., fear of spiders) could be inherited, as there is no known mechanism to translate such a specific thought into a unique, heritable biomolecular marker.

*   **Real-World Correlates:** Commenters connected the research to known phenomena like transgenerational trauma, citing the Dutch Hunger Winter as an example of how severe environmental stress can leave an epigenetic mark on future generations.

*   **Skepticism and Nuance:** While most were intrigued, some expressed skepticism, quoting an epigeneticist from the article who called the mechanisms "hand-wavy." Others sought more mainstream technical sources to follow the research, while some clarified the scientific details, such as the effect of nicotine on liver enzymes potentially reducing a drug's effect, not enabling better "abuse."

**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46410402

> **Article:** The article details the process of building a custom macOS menu bar application to monitor for thermal throttling on a Mac. The author, Stanislas, was motivated by observing performance drops during heavy workloads (like video encoding) and wanted a clear, immediate indicator of when the system was thermal throttling. The post explains the technical challenges of reliably detecting throttling on macOS, exploring various methods like reading CPU frequency, power state, and using system APIs. The final application provides a simple visual cue in the menu bar to alert the user when thermal pressure is occurring.

## [AI Slop Report: The Global Rise of Low-Quality AI Videos](https://www.kapwing.com/blog/ai-slop-report-the-global-rise-of-low-quality-ai-videos/)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46409125

> **Article:** The article "AI Slop Report" from Kapwing analyzes the global rise of low-quality, AI-generated videos on platforms like YouTube. It defines "AI slop" as content that is mass-produced, formulaic, and often nonsensical, using tools for script generation, voiceovers, and stock footage. The report identifies popular subgenres, such as "oddly satisfying" compilations, fake rescue stories, and AI-narrated listicles. It highlights that this trend is driven by the low barrier to entry and the potential for ad revenue, leading to a flood of content that is difficult to distinguish from human-made videos but offers little to no value.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with users expressing frustration and concern over the proliferation of "AI slop." Key themes include:

*   **Personal Experience:** Many commenters confirm the article's findings, sharing their own encounters with AI-generated content in their YouTube feeds, including fake animal rescue videos, deepfaked political commentators, and AI-narrated podcasts.
*   **Algorithmic Failure:** A significant portion of the discussion criticizes YouTube's recommendation algorithm for actively promoting this low-quality content, even when users have specific, high-quality interests. Users report their feeds are filled with sensationalist junk that doesn't align with their viewing history.
*   **User-Driven Solutions:** Several users share strategies for combating the slop, such as aggressively using YouTube's "Not interested" and "Don't recommend channel" features, pruning watch history, or abandoning the platform for curated, text-based sources.
*   **Systemic Concerns:** The conversation touches on deeper issues, including the difficulty of automatically detecting AI content, the economic incentives that favor quantity over quality, and the potential for this content to be used for propaganda or to rot users' brains.
*   **Irony:** One commenter points out the irony of the source website itself potentially using AI-generated imagery, while another notes that the problem might be an improvement over previous human-created, but abusive, content farms.

## [Hungry Fat Cells Could Someday Starve Cancer](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429411/how-hungry-fat-cells-could-someday-starve-cancer-death)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46409928

> **Article:** Researchers at UCSF have developed a novel cancer therapy that involves genetically engineering a patient's own fat cells to become "metabolic sinks." These engineered cells express a protein called UCP1, which makes them highly efficient at burning glucose and lipids for heat. When implanted near a tumor, these hyperactive fat cells compete with cancer cells for nutrients, effectively "starving" the tumor and slowing its growth in mouse models. The research was led by Ph.D. candidate Phuong Nguyen, who tragically passed away before its completion. The study is dedicated to him.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely positive but cautious, focusing on the promise of the research while highlighting significant practical and theoretical challenges. Key points include:
*   **Promising Mechanism:** Commenters appreciate the elegance of the "metabolic competition" approach, which uses the body's own systems rather than direct toxins.
*   **Human Applicability & Feasibility:** A major point of debate is the practicality for human patients. While the article mentions cold exposure as a natural way to convert fat, many question if sick patients could endure it. The discussion clarifies that the study used genetic engineering (CRISPR), not cold therapy, to achieve the effect.
*   **Skepticism & Context:** Some users express skepticism, noting that similar metabolic theories (like ketogenic diets) have shown promise in mice but failed to translate to effective human cancer treatments. They caution that cancer's adaptability and the lack of strong human evidence are significant hurdles.
*   **Tangential Ideas:** The discussion branches into related topics, such as the potential of cold exposure therapies (like the Wim Hof Method) and the possibility of triggering these metabolic changes artificially without genetic modification.
*   **Human Element:** There is a strong, respectful acknowledgment of the lead author's premature death and the hope that his promising work will be continued.

## [Functional programming and reliability: ADTs, safety, critical infrastructure](https://blog.rastrian.dev/post/why-reliability-demands-functional-programming-adts-safety-and-critical-infrastructure)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46406901

> **Article:** The article argues that for critical infrastructure (banking, telecom, payments), reliability is paramount and can be significantly improved by adopting Functional Programming (FP) principles. It specifically highlights the use of Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) to "make illegal states unrepresentable," effectively turning runtime errors into compile-time errors. The author posits that this approach, combined with immutability and explicit error handling (e.g., `Option` and `Result` types instead of exceptions), prevents the code from entering impossible states, thereby reducing production incidents and increasing safety.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a nuanced debate on the article's claims, focusing on the distinction between functional programming and strong type systems:

*   **FP vs. Strong Typing:** Several commenters argue that the article conflates functional programming with static typing. They suggest that the reliability benefits described are primarily due to strong type systems (found in languages like OCaml and Haskell), not FP itself, noting that dynamically typed FP languages like Racket are not covered.
*   **Practicality and Alternatives:** Some users contend that while ADTs and strong types are beneficial, they are not a silver bullet. They argue that real-world reliability is often achieved through fault tolerance, reconciliation, and operational practices (e.g., fuzz testing). Others find that strict functional composition can complicate complex error handling in large systems.
*   **Untagged vs. Tagged Unions:** A technical sub-thread debated the merits of "untagged" unions (TypeScript, Scala 3) versus "tagged" unions (ADTs in Haskell). While one commenter claimed untagged unions are superior, others defended tagged unions as more generally useful and less error-prone.
*   **Empirical Evidence and Industry Reality:** Commenters questioned the lack of hard evidence for the article's claims, while others provided academic links. The discussion also highlighted a disconnect between theory and practice, noting that many critical industries still rely on "flaky" systems (e.g., FTP, Excel) and that reliability is often deprioritized by product teams until a major incident occurs.

## [Learn computer graphics from scratch and for free](https://www.scratchapixel.com)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 16 | **ID:** 46410210

> **Article:** The article links to "Scratchapixel," a free online resource for learning computer graphics from scratch. The site aims to provide a comprehensive education on topics like 3D rendering, ray tracing, and rasterization, positioning itself as an accessible alternative to expensive or hard-to-find textbooks and opaque proprietary documentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community largely praised the Scratchapixel resource, noting its significant improvements and the general need for more open education in computer graphics. Key discussion points include:

*   **The "From Scratch" Approach:** Several users agreed that the best way to learn graphics fundamentals is by writing software rasterizers and ray tracers, effectively ignoring GPUs at first to understand the core principles.
*   **API Overwhelm:** A common sentiment is that modern graphics APIs like Vulkan are too complex for beginners. Users who lack a strong foundation in fundamentals find these APIs confusing and frustrating ("drinking from a firehose").
*   **Alternative Learning Paths:** For those intimidated by native APIs, commenters recommended starting with WebGPU or WebGL. These browser-based APIs are easier to learn and teach concepts applicable to modern native APIs like Vulkan and Metal.
*   **Learning by Building:** Several users shared resources for building a 3D renderer from first principles, such as the "build-your-own-x" GitHub repository and the "tinyrenderer" tutorial.
*   **Minor Criticisms:** One user criticized the site for using Discord as its only contact method, which they found to be a "turn-off." Another praised the site's author for previously acting on HN feedback to remove AI-generated thumbnails.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after 10 years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 127 | **Comments:** 43 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Szczepan Faber announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, the most popular mocking framework for Java, after 10 years. His decision is driven by burnout and frustration with recent changes in the Java ecosystem. The primary catalyst is Java's move towards "Integrity by Default" (JEP 451), which disallows the dynamic loading of agents that Mockito relied upon for its functionality. This forced a major breaking change in Mockito 5, requiring users to run tests with a specific Java agent flag. Faber felt the Java platform team was unsympathetic to the maintenance burden this imposed on his project. He also cites the difficulty of supporting Kotlin, which has significant implementation downsides for Mockito's architecture, and the general lack of support for open-source maintainers.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revolves around three main themes: the technical conflict, the nature of open-source maintenance, and the philosophy of testing.

1.  **The Java "Integrity by Default" Conflict:** This is the central technical point. A Java developer (pron), who appears to be from the OpenJDK team, explains that the platform is prioritizing security and integrity by preventing libraries from secretly modifying the runtime. They argue this is a net positive for all users, even if it inconveniences specific tools like Mockito. Others ask for clarification on what JVM "agents" are and why dynamic attachment is being restricted.

2.  **The Burden of Open-Source Maintenance:** Many commenters express sympathy for the maintainer, highlighting the "XKCD" problem where critical infrastructure rests on a handful of unpaid volunteers. There's a consensus that it's irresponsible for the Java platform to cause such breakage without providing support to the affected projects.

3.  **Debate on Mocking vs. Fakes:** Several comments pivot to a broader debate on testing practices. Some argue that mocking is overused, leads to brittle tests, and that developers should prefer real implementations or "fakes." Others defend mocking as a necessary tool for testing legacy code that wasn't designed with testability in mind. The discussion also touches on whether Java even needs a mocking library and whether Kotlin-specific issues should be handled by a Kotlin-native tool like MockK instead of Mockito.

## [C++ says “We have try. . . finally at home”](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20251222-00/?p=111890)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46408984

> **Article:** The article, from Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" blog, uses a popular meme format ("We have X at home") to explain a C++ feature. The title "C++ says 'We have try...finally at home'" implies that C++ already has a mechanism equivalent to the `try...finally` block found in languages like Java or C#. The "at home" version is C++'s destructor mechanism, which is the foundation of the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern. The core idea is that an object's destructor is automatically called when it goes out of scope, guaranteeing cleanup regardless of how the scope is exited (e.g., via a normal return or an exception). This provides the same cleanup guarantees as a `finally` block.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the comparison between C++'s RAII/destructors and the `try...finally` construct. Key points included:

*   **RAII vs. `finally`:** Many commenters argued that RAII is superior because it's less verbose, avoids nested `try...finally` blocks, and ties resource management to object lifetime, making it less error-prone. However, others noted that they serve different purposes: destructors are tied to ownership, while `finally` is for operation-scoped cleanup.
*   **Alternatives and Ergonomics:** Users mentioned Swift's `defer` block as a more universal and flexible solution. A C++ macro for a `defer`-like functionality was also shared, demonstrating how to achieve similar behavior without creating a full class.
*   **Readability and Complexity:** The complexity of C++ syntax was a recurring theme, with some commenters joking that it's only "readable" until you have to read someone else's code.
*   **Error Handling Nuances:** A significant sub-thread focused on error handling. One user pointed out that in many languages, an exception in a `finally` block can overwrite the original exception, which is a major flaw. Another countered that Python, for example, preserves the original traceback. The C++ approach of crashing the program if a destructor throws was widely criticized as an extreme and problematic solution.
*   **Practical Pitfalls:** Commenters warned against calling arbitrary callbacks from destructors due to the risk of exceptions (which terminate the program in C++) or modifying data structures during iteration.

## [Dialtone – AOL 3.0 Server](https://dialtone.live/)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46408192

> **Article:** The article links to "Dialtone," a project that emulates the AOL 3.0 server and user experience. It aims to recreate the "old internet" feel of AOL, allowing users to connect and experience the curated, walled-garden environment that defined the service. The project includes emulators for classic applications like the AOL client and potentially other software from that era (e.g., Mac emulator, Civilization).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely nostalgic, with users expressing excitement about the revival of the AOL interface and the "internet we lost." However, there is a significant debate about the historical accuracy of this nostalgia. One commenter argues that AOL was actually a precursor to modern "enshittified" big tech (centralized, ad-driven, walled gardens) rather than the open, chaotic "real internet," comparing the romanticization of AOL to romanticizing Clippy.

Technical and practical details are also covered:
*   **Functionality:** Users explain that AOL was a dial-up ISP that provided a proprietary client containing a browser, email, and instant messaging (AIM), which most users never left.
*   **AI Usage:** There is minor criticism that the project uses Grok (xAI) for its chatbot, with a suggestion that an LLM with an "unhinged mode" would be more authentic.
*   **Open Source:** A user criticizes the project for not being open-sourced, arguing that revival projects need to be open to ensure long-term preservation and prevent data loss if the host goes down.
*   **Alternatives:** Users mention other revival projects, specifically a Prodigy online emulator and a recreation of the "MadMaze" game.
*   **Infrastructure:** The HN community effectively "Hugged to death" the website, and users discussed the technical implementation (e.g., "vibe coding" with Claude).

## [2 in 3 Americans think AI will cause major harm to humans in the next 20 years [pdf] (2024)](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/03/pi_2025.04.03_us-public-and-ai-experts_topline.pdf)
**Score:** 78 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46412411

> **Article:** A Pew Research Center survey (2024) finds that a majority of Americans (65%) believe artificial intelligence will cause major harm to humans within the next 20 years. In contrast, AI experts are far more optimistic, with 73% believing AI will be more beneficial than harmful. The general public is particularly concerned about AI's impact on news and elections, while experts are more worried about issues like healthcare and privacy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on three main themes:

1.  **The Nature of the Threat:** Commenters debate whether the primary danger is AI itself or human misuse of AI. While the original article highlights public fear regarding AI's impact on news and elections, some users argue that practical issues like AI-driven customer service and employment disruption will be more directly harmful to daily life. Others contend that the erosion of trust in information caused by AI-generated content is a catastrophic threat to democracy.

2.  **Existential Risk and "Doomerism":** A significant debate unfolds regarding the "AI doomer" narrative of human extinction. One side argues that the fear of intelligent machines turning on humanity is irrational, comparing it to historical anxieties about freed slaves and asserting that true intelligence would logically favor cooperation over destruction. The opposing view holds that granting AI the ability to self-replicate and operate without safeguards would be a fatal mistake.

3.  **Socio-Economic and Ethical Concerns:** Users also discussed the practical downsides of the AI boom, including the environmental and infrastructural strain of building data centers. There was skepticism about whether AI's current "free or affordable" availability in the developing world is a sustainable ladder for advancement or simply a temporary, VC-subsidized phase. Finally, commenters pointed to current harms, such as AI's poor performance in mental health contexts, as evidence that the technology is already causing damage.

## [Global Memory Shortage Crisis: Market Analysis](https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/global-memory-shortage-crisis-market-analysis-and-the-potential-impact-on-the-smartphone-and-pc-markets-in-2026/)
**Score:** 67 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46411902

> **Article:** The article from IDC analyzes an impending global memory (RAM) shortage crisis, projected for 2026. It attributes the shortage to a strategic reallocation of silicon wafer capacity away from consumer electronics (smartphones, PCs) towards high-performance memory (HBM) required for AI data centers. This zero-sum game is expected to cause a contraction in the smartphone and PC markets due to increased average selling prices (ASP) as manufacturers pass on higher component costs to consumers.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a deep skepticism of the article's narrative and explores broader economic and technological implications. Key points include:

*   **Skepticism of the "AI Growth" Narrative:** Several users, notably IAmGraydon, argue the shortage is not a natural result of AI growth but was "engineered" by a specific deal between OpenAI, Samsung, and SK Hynix to secure 40% of wafer production, which prompted competitors to panic-buy the remaining supply.
*   **Cynicism about Consumer Impact:** Users express that the shortage's primary purpose is to fuel AI development, leading to a future where personal computers become mere terminals for cloud-based AI services, reinforcing a "you will own nothing" subscription-based economy.
*   **Market and Tech Consequences:** Commenters predict stagnation in consumer hardware features, a potential competitive advantage for Apple (if it can secure supply), and a possible (though debated) push towards more memory-efficient software.
*   **Broader Economic Concerns:** The discussion touches on the potential for AI to outbid humans for essential resources (computing, energy), the unsustainability of current AI demand, and the irony that making electronics more expensive might not translate to cost reductions in other sectors like healthcare.
