## [Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/27/)
**Score:** 649 | **Comments:** 245 | **ID:** 46407337

> **Article:** The article "Replacing JavaScript with Just HTML" argues for using modern, native HTML elements to handle common interactive web features instead of immediately reaching for JavaScript frameworks. It showcases several examples where HTML alone provides significant functionality, including `<details>`/`<summary>` for accordions, `<datalist>` for autocomplete suggestions, the Popover API for tooltips and modals, and the upcoming customizable `<select>` element. The core message is to start with the simplest, built-in browser capabilities to reduce complexity, improve performance, and enhance accessibility before adding JavaScript.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely supportive of the article's premise but highlights significant practical challenges. Key points include:

*   **Styling and Consistency:** A major critique is that native HTML elements are notoriously difficult to style consistently across different browsers (e.g., `<datalist>`, `<select>`), which often forces developers to use JavaScript-based solutions to meet design requirements.
*   **Feature Completeness:** While HTML provides a baseline, it often lacks advanced functionality. For example, `<datalist>` doesn't support complex filtering logic, and `<details>`/`<summary>` cannot be animated, limiting their use in sophisticated UIs.
*   **The "Pragmatism vs. Idealism" Debate:** Commenters discuss the trade-offs. The ideal approach is to start with HTML and add JS only when necessary. However, the reality is that client demands and time constraints often push developers toward more complex, JS-heavy solutions from the start.
*   **The Meta-Critique:** A humorous but pointed observation was made that the article's own header image fails to load without JavaScript, ironically proving the point that even advocates for simple HTML sometimes rely on JS.
*   **Broader Industry Context:** The conversation expanded to a larger trend of "returning to the server" with technologies like HTMX and Hotwire, which aim to reduce client-side JavaScript by handling interactivity on the server, reflecting a wider industry pushback against the complexity of modern front-end development.

**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 281 | **ID:** 46409969

> **Article:** The article "Last Year on My Mac: Look Back in Disbelief" is a critical review of Apple's recent software design philosophy, specifically focusing on the "Tahoe" (macOS 26) release and the "Liquid Glass" aesthetic. The author expresses disbelief at the decline in UI quality, citing excessive whitespace, low contrast, oversized controls, and poor readability. The article frames this as a continuation of a negative trend where Apple prioritizes flashy, visually intrusive design over functional clarity and efficiency, leading to a frustrating user experience for long-time Mac users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly negative, echoing the article's criticisms of Apple's "Tahoe" UI. Key points of agreement include:

*   **UI/UX Degradation:** Users universally criticize the "Liquid Glass" design for being a "criminal worsening" of UI quality. Common complaints are excessive whitespace, low contrast, poor readability, "sloppy" design elements (like nested rounded rectangles), and distracting animations. Many compare it unfavorably to Windows Vista.
*   **Functional Regressions:** Commenters note that the new UI is not just ugly but functionally worse, requiring more clicks for common tasks and breaking established workflows. The Settings app's search is specifically called out as broken.
*   **Apple's Strategic Misalignment:** There is a strong sentiment that Apple no longer caters to power users. Some speculate the design is a misguided attempt to make macOS more like visionOS to salvage the Vision Pro's failure. Others believe the yearly release cycle forces "change for change's sake" to drive hardware sales, even at the cost of software quality.
*   **User Reactions:** The response from the user base is one of frustration and avoidance. Many are refusing to upgrade, holding onto older macOS versions, or seriously considering a switch to Linux. The negative experience is not limited to macOS, with iOS 26 also receiving heavy criticism for being confusing and less efficient.

## [Building a macOS app to know when my Mac is thermal throttling](https://stanislas.blog/2025/12/macos-thermal-throttling-app/)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46410402

> **Article:** The article details the creation of a custom macOS application designed to detect and notify the user when their Mac is experiencing thermal throttling. The author, Stanislas, was motivated by observing performance drops during intensive tasks on his M1 Max MacBook Pro. He explains that while macOS manages thermal performance automatically, it doesn't provide clear feedback to the user when it's happening. The post walks through the technical process of building the app, using Apple's `ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState` API to monitor the system's thermal condition. The resulting application is a simple menu bar utility that changes its icon or provides a notification when the thermal state is critical, offering a clear, real-time indicator of performance limitation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the utility of such a tool and the broader context of Mac thermal management. Key points include:

*   **Actionability:** A primary question was "what can you do about it?" The community provided several answers:
    *   For Macs with fans (Pro models), users can use third-party apps like iStat Menus to implement custom, more aggressive fan curves or enable macOS's built-in "High Power Mode" to allow fans to run faster.
    *   For fanless MacBooks (Air), options are limited to passive cooling measures like elevating the device or using an external fan.
    *   General maintenance, such as cleaning dust and pet hair from internal fans, was also highlighted as a crucial preventative step.

*   **Existing Alternatives:** Many users mentioned existing, popular system monitoring tools like `stats` (via Homebrew) and iStat Menus, which can display CPU usage, wattage, and fan speeds, allowing users to infer throttling.

*   **Technical Nuances:** A developer in the thread noted a known bug with Apple's `thermalState` API where it fails to update without a process restart, suggesting the author might have encountered and worked around this.

*   **Nostalgia and Hardware:** The conversation broadened to include complaints about older Intel-based Macs (especially the 2017 models and their butterfly keyboards) and a general consensus that Apple Silicon represents a massive improvement in performance and thermal efficiency.

## [AI Slop Report: The Global Rise of Low-Quality AI Videos](https://www.kapwing.com/blog/ai-slop-report-the-global-rise-of-low-quality-ai-videos/)
**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 156 | **ID:** 46409125

> **Article:** The article "AI Slop Report" from Kapwing analyzes the global proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated videos on platforms like YouTube. It defines "AI slop" as content that is mass-produced, repetitive, and often nonsensical, using tools for script generation, voiceovers, and visuals. The report identifies key trends, such as "wholesome" animal rescue stories, fake disaster footage, and AI-narrated listicles. It highlights that this phenomenon is not just a Western issue, noting significant viewership in countries like Spain and India. The core argument is that the low cost of production and the potential for ad revenue are incentivizing a flood of this content, which threatens to drown out authentic human creativity and degrade the user experience on content platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the rise of AI-generated content and expresses significant frustration with current content platforms, particularly YouTube. Key points of discussion include:

*   **User Experience on YouTube:** Many users report a deteriorating experience, with the YouTube algorithm pushing irrelevant, disturbing, or low-quality content (including AI slop) despite their viewing habits. They describe a constant battle of using "Not Interested" and "Don't Recommend Channel" features to curate their feed.
*   **The "End Game" and Dangers:** Commenters speculate on the long-term consequences, fearing a future where AI content is optimized for and consumed by AI bots, creating a closed loop. A more immediate danger noted is the use of deepfakes for political disinformation, which often go unnoticed by viewers.
*   **Detection and Mitigation:** A debate emerges on whether AI content can be automatically detected. Most are pessimistic, viewing it as a costly "cat and mouse game." The consensus is that platforms have little financial incentive to curb this content as long as it drives engagement.
*   **Solutions and Workarounds:** Some users share personal strategies for avoiding slop, such as disabling watch history and seeking information from text-based sources. Others suggest actively curating feeds and being aggressive with blocking tools.
*   **Irony and Skepticism:** A few users point out the irony of the article's source (Kapwing) potentially being a tool for creating such content, while others defend it as a legitimate analysis of the market.

## [Functional programming and reliability: ADTs, safety, critical infrastructure](https://blog.rastrian.dev/post/why-reliability-demands-functional-programming-adts-safety-and-critical-infrastructure)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46406901

> **Article:** The article argues that for critical infrastructure (banking, telecom, payments), functional programming (FP) and specifically Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are essential for reliability. The core thesis is that "making illegal states unrepresentable" allows developers to model domain logic precisely, ensuring that invalid states are impossible at the compile level. This prevents bugs that arise from entering unexpected states. The author contrasts this with traditional approaches that rely heavily on runtime checks and defensive programming, asserting that FP offers a more robust foundation for building fault-tolerant systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted debate on the article's claims, centering on the relationship between functional programming, strong type systems, and reliability.

Key points of contention include:
*   **FP vs. Strong Typing:** Several users argue that the article conflates functional programming with strong static typing. They contend that the reliability benefits (like immutability and pure functions) can be achieved in dynamically typed languages (like JavaScript or Racket) and that the FP community often overemphasizes types at the expense of other functional benefits.
*   **Practicality vs. Perfection:** A recurring theme is the distinction between "perfect correctness" and "fault tolerance." Some commenters argue that real-world critical systems prioritize resilience, reconciliation, and redundancy over preventing all possible errors at compile time. The author clarifies that he sees these as complementary, not mutually exclusive.
*   **Complexity and Error Handling:** Critics argue that strict FP can make complex error handling cumbersome, as it avoids exceptions and requires handling every possible failure case explicitly. This can lead to verbose and hard-to-maintain code in large systems.
*   **ADTs vs. Untagged Unions:** A technical sub-thread debates the utility of Algebraic Data Types (tagged unions) versus untagged unions (like in TypeScript). While one user claimed untagged unions are superior, others defended tagged unions as more generally useful and safer.
*   **Skepticism and Evidence:** Some users express skepticism about the "silver bullet" claims, noting that reliability is often a cost center in business and that there is a lack of hard empirical evidence proving static typing universally improves reliability. Others countered with academic studies to refute this.
*   **Systemic View:** A highly upvoted comment references the paper "How Complex Systems Fail," suggesting that incidents often arise from latent, possible states rather than "impossible" ones, challenging the article's core premise that preventing illegal states is the primary solution.

Overall, the community agrees on the value of good engineering practices but is divided on whether FP and strong typing are the *essential* or *superior* tools for achieving reliability in critical systems.

**Score:** 138 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46406098

> **Article:** The article links to a talk from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3) titled "Liberating Bluetooth on the ESP32". The talk details a reverse-engineering effort to create a free and open-source software (FOSS) replacement for the proprietary, closed-source Bluetooth firmware ("radio blobs") used on the popular ESP32 microcontroller. The project's goal is to achieve full software freedom and control over the Bluetooth hardware without relying on the manufacturer's opaque binary files.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is centered on the technical details of the ESP32, the quality of the post's source link, and an off-topic debate about product origin. Key points include:
*   **Source Correction:** Several users pointed out that the initial link was to a low-quality, unofficial recording. They provided direct links to the official recording from media.ccc.de and a YouTube upload.
*   **ESP32 Openness:** Users clarified that the ESP32 platform is already quite open-source, with a good official development framework (ESP-IDF). The reverse-engineering effort is specifically targeted at the closed-source Bluetooth and other radio firmware blobs, not the entire chip.
*   **Off-Topic Tangent:** One commenter derailed the conversation by complaining about their inability to get Bluetooth audio working on Linux and blaming "Chinese" products. This was met with criticism, with other users attributing the issue to buying cheap hardware rather than its country of origin.

## [Hungry Fat Cells Could Someday Starve Cancer](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429411/how-hungry-fat-cells-could-someday-starve-cancer-death)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46409928

> **Article:** A study from UCSF (published Jan 2025) details a novel cancer treatment strategy that aims to "starve" cancer cells rather than poison them. Researchers discovered that by genetically modifying white fat cells (using CRISPR to activate the UCP1 gene), they can convert them into "beige" fat. These modified cells become metabolically hyper-active, consuming vast amounts of glucose and nutrients. When implanted near tumors in mice, these "hungry" fat cells effectively competed with the cancer for fuel, slowing tumor growth and extending survival. The study is dedicated to its first author, Taps Nguyen, who passed away unexpectedly at age 35 just before the work was completed.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion focused on the validity of the "metabolic theory of cancer," the practicality of the proposed methods, and the human element of the research.
*   **Metabolic Theory Skepticism:** Several users noted that theories linking cancer to metabolism (and potential treatments like cold exposure or ketogenic diets) have existed for a long time but have historically failed to produce reliable clinical results. There was skepticism that this mouse study would translate to human survivability.
*   **Methodology Clarifications:** Users debated the method of action. While the article mentions cold exposure as the natural inspiration for the fat conversion, commenters clarified that the study used genetic engineering (CRISPR) to achieve this, not just cold baths. There was also a discussion on the feasibility of sustained cold exposure for patients, with one user noting it increases hunger, which could counteract the benefits.
*   **Speculation and Personal Experience:** One user shared their personal experience with the Wim Hof Method and extreme cold exposure, linking it to norepinephrine release, while others discussed the potential of "artificially" triggering the cold signal without actual freezing.
*   **Tribute:** There was a recurring sentiment of sadness regarding the premature death of the lead author, Taps Nguyen, with users expressing hope that his colleagues would continue the promising work.

>
> **Discussion:** The HN community response is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising Scratchapixel as a valuable and much-needed free educational resource. Key discussion points include:

*   **The Accessibility Problem:** Commenters agree that learning computer graphics is difficult due to the high cost of textbooks, the obscurity of older techniques, and the complexity of modern graphics APIs (like Vulkan) which are hard to grasp without a strong foundation.
*   **Learning Pathways:** A common suggestion for beginners is to start by writing software-based renderers (rasterizers and ray tracers) on the CPU to understand the fundamental principles before moving on to complex GPU APIs. Several users shared links to other resources for this approach, such as "tinyrenderer" and "build-your-own-x".
*   **API Recommendations:** For those intimidated by low-level APIs like Vulkan, commenters recommend starting with WebGPU or WebGL, which are easier to learn but teach concepts applicable to all modern graphics programming.
*   **Personal Experiences:** Many users shared their own stories of wanting to learn graphics programming but being discouraged by the complexity, expressing a shared desire for resources like Scratchapixel to finally break through that barrier.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after 10 years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 107 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue announcement from the lead maintainer of Mockito, a popular Java mocking framework, stating they are stepping down after 10 years. The post details the immense personal time commitment and the technical challenges that led to this decision. Key issues included a major breaking change in Mockito 5 (requiring it to be an agent due to JVM 22 changes), the difficulty of supporting Kotlin (which has significant implementation downsides for Mockito), and a general lack of support and feedback from the broader JVM ecosystem, which left the maintainer feeling isolated and burnt out.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on four main themes:
1.  **The Burnout of OSS Maintainers:** Commenters expressed sadness and understanding, highlighting the common problem of critical open-source projects being maintained by a few individuals who receive little support.
2.  **Technical Justification Debate:** Some users questioned the maintainer's reasoning, particularly why enabling a flag for the new JVM agent requirement was not a viable solution and why Kotlin support was maintained if it was so problematic.
3.  **The Role of Mocking:** A sub-discussion debated the necessity of mocking libraries like Mockito, with some arguing they are overused and that real implementations or proper testable design are better.
4.  **Kotlin vs. Java Ecosystem:** It was noted that Mockito is a poor fit for Kotlin, and users of that language should prefer a Kotlin-native framework like MockK.

## [C++ says “We have try. . . finally at home”](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20251222-00/?p=111890)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46408984

> **Article:** The article, from Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" blog, explains that C++ does not have a `finally` keyword like Java or C#. Instead, it achieves the same goal of guaranteed cleanup through a more powerful, language-integrated mechanism: destructors and the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom. The title is a meme reference ("We have try...finally at home"), implying that C++'s destructor-based approach is its version of `finally`, but it's fundamentally different in philosophy and implementation. The article demonstrates how a simple class with a destructor can automatically perform cleanup when an object goes out of scope, effectively creating a `finally` block without special syntax.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the comparison between C++'s RAII and the `defer`/`finally` pattern found in other languages. Key points include:

*   **RAII vs. `finally`:** Many commenters debated the merits. Proponents of RAII (like `winternewt`) argued it's superior because it's tied to object lifetime, reducing boilerplate and nested `try...finally` blocks. Others noted they serve different purposes: RAII is for ownership, while `finally` is for operation-scoped cleanup.
*   **Alternative Syntax:** Users brought up Swift's `defer` as a more universal and convenient syntax for scope-based cleanup that isn't tied to classes. A C++ macro implementation for a `defer`-like behavior was also shared.
*   **Error Handling Philosophy:** A major tangent was the problem of exceptions thrown within `finally` blocks. One commenter argued that most languages handle this incorrectly by prioritizing the new exception over the original, thus obscuring the root cause of the error.
*   **C++ Complexity:** The inherent complexity and "readability" of C++ was a recurring theme, with some joking that it only becomes readable after extensive immersion.
*   **Meme Origin:** A minor point of discussion was the origin of the "We have X at home" meme, with one user noting it appeared in an Eddie Murphy special from 1987.

## [Dialtone – AOL 3.0 Server](https://dialtone.live/)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46408192

> **Article:** The article links to "Dialtone," a project that emulates the AOL 3.0 server experience. It aims to recreate the look, feel, and functionality of the classic AOL client, including its dial-up interface, chat rooms, and built-in applications. The project serves as a nostalgic "time machine" for the early internet era, allowing users to experience the curated, walled-garden environment that defined AOL.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely nostalgic, with users expressing excitement about reliving the "internet we lost." However, there is a significant counter-argument that AOL wasn't the idealized internet but rather a precursor to the centralized, commercialized "walled gardens" of today's big tech. Key points include:

*   **Nostalgia vs. Reality:** While many celebrate the memory, one commenter argues that AOL's model (centralized, ad-driven, keyword-based search) is exactly what modern tech is returning to, not a lost ideal.
*   **Technical Explanations:** For those who never experienced it, users explain how AOL worked as a dial-up ISP with its own proprietary client, ecosystem, and "keywords" that replaced URLs.
*   **Open Source Concerns:** A point of contention is that the server software is not open-sourced, raising fears about the project's long-term preservation and sustainability.
*   **Other Revivals:** The conversation also mentions other retro-computing projects, such as a Prodigy online emulator and the classic game MadMaze.
