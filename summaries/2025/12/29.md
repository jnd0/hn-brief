# Hacker News Summary - 2025-12-29

## [What an unprocessed photo looks like](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/)
**Score:** 1934 | **Comments:** 321 | **ID:** 46415225

> **Article:** The article "What an unprocessed photo looks like" demystifies the digital photography pipeline by showing the journey of a single image from its raw sensor data to the final, polished photograph. It explains that camera sensors don't capture color directly; they record linear light intensity values. The article illustrates several key processing steps: a "Bayer filter" pattern (RGGB) means each pixel only records one color, which must be interpolated in a process called "demosaicing" to create a full-color image. Furthermore, because sensors are linear and human vision is not, the raw data must undergo "gamma correction" to appear correctly bright on a monitor. The final image is the result of a long chain of computational decisions, not a direct capture of reality.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely affirms the article's premise that there is no such thing as an "unprocessed" or "original" digital photograph. Commentators agree that every image, even a JPEG straight from the camera, is a heavily processed interpretation of sensor data.

A central theme is the philosophical debate over what constitutes a "real" or "fake" photo. Many users argue that the term is meaningless, as the entire process is an interpretation. One commenter suggests that the true distinction should be between global edits (affecting the whole image) and local edits (like retouching specific objects), with intent to deceive being the only real criterion for a "fake" image.

Several technical points were elaborated on:
*   **Gamma Correction:** Users explained that it's not just a monitor limitation but a fundamental part of signal processing, used to better allocate bit-depth and to compensate for the non-linear response of both film and digital sensors.
*   **Bayer Filters & AI:** The discussion touched on Bayer filters, demosaicing, and the fact that machine learning algorithms have been the state-of-the-art for demosaicing for years, blurring the line between "traditional" and "AI" image processing.
*   **Human Perception:** A compelling analogy was made to how human vision itself is a "hallucination," where the brain fills in details, similar to how demosaicing algorithms reconstruct a full image from sparse data.

Finally, the conversation included practical applications, with one user noting that cinematographers intentionally shoot "flat" (logarithmic) footage to preserve maximum dynamic range for color grading, a parallel to the raw photo process.

## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 447 | **Comments:** 487 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" is a personal narrative detailing a disastrous travel experience with Germany's national railway. The author describes a journey that involved multiple severe delays, poor communication, and ultimately being rerouted to a completely different city far from their intended destination. The core of the complaint centers on bureaucratic inflexibility: the train was not permitted to stop at the author's correct station because it wasn't officially scheduled to do so on that specific rerouted service. This left the author stranded 60km away from their home, forced to find alternative transport late at night. The author frames this as being "kidnapped" by the system, highlighting a lack of customer care, poor communication (especially for non-German speakers), and a rigid adherence to rules that defies common sense.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 403 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that modern browsers will render non-standard, custom HTML tags (e.g., `<my-tag>`) without errors. By default, these unknown elements behave like inline `<span>` elements but can be fully controlled with CSS selectors and JavaScript. The author presents this as a simple, native alternative to heavy frameworks for creating semantic, component-based markup, noting that using a hyphen in the tag name is a convention to avoid conflicts with current or future HTML standards.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but quickly pivots to the more robust and standardized solution of Web Components. Commenters clarify the technical details, noting that hyphenated custom tags are treated as standard `HTMLElement` objects (not `HTMLUnknownElement`) to ensure future compatibility.

A recurring theme is the contrast between using simple custom tags and the full power of the Custom Elements API. While some users shared creative, lightweight implementations (like a `<yes-script>` tag), many pointed to established libraries like Lit as the proper way to build encapsulated, interactive components.

There was a significant debate around the article's examples, with several developers arguing that using standard semantic HTML tags (like `<article>` or `<header>`) or CSS classes is superior to creating "div soup" with custom tag names. The conversation also included a nostalgic lament that the web development industry's heavy reliance on frameworks like React has overshadowed the power and elegance of native browser features like Web Components, which are often sufficient for many use cases.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after ten years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, a popular mocking framework for Java, after ten years. The post details the significant personal effort involved in maintaining the project and references a blog post for the full context. The primary technical reason cited for his burnout is the difficulty of adapting Mockito to upcoming changes in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), specifically JEP 451, which disallows the dynamic loading of agents. This forced a major architectural change in Mockito 5, where it now requires being installed as a Java agent at startup, a significant breaking change that caused considerable "energy drain" for the maintainer. He also mentions the ongoing challenges of supporting Kotlin, which adds complexity to the project. The post concludes with gratitude to the community and other contributors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the technical challenges leading to the maintainer's departure, the broader philosophy of mocking in software testing, and the systemic issues of open-source sustainability.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the technical conflict between Mockito and the JVM's evolution. Commenters discuss the implications of JEP 451, which requires a command-line flag to enable dynamic agent attachment. Some question why this change was so burdensome, suggesting that adding a flag for tests should be a simple solution. However, a detailed response from a JDK maintainer (pron) explains the principle of "Integrity by Default," arguing that allowing libraries to secretly modify running code is a major risk to security, performance, and long-term compatibility. This commenter asserts that the change was necessary for the health of the entire ecosystem, even if it created work for library authors. Others counter that if a change breaks a tool as widely used as Mockito, it could defeat the purpose of the "by-default" security improvement, as many will simply re-enable the old behavior.

The second theme is a debate on the value and proper use of mocking frameworks. Several commenters are critical of mocking, arguing that it's often overused to test poorly designed, untestable code. They suggest that using real implementations or "fakes" is a better practice and that the need for mocks is a "code smell." In contrast, other developers defend Mockito as an essential tool for dealing with legacy codebases that cannot be easily refactored. There is also a specific discussion about Kotlin, with some suggesting that Mockito is a poor fit and that Kotlin users should use a dedicated framework like MockK instead.

Finally, the discussion touches on the systemic problems of open-source maintenance. Many commenters express sympathy for the maintainer, referencing the classic XKCD comic about the single volunteer responsible for a critical piece of software. The conversation highlights the burnout and thanklessness of unpaid maintenance, with a debate on whether financial compensation would have solved the issue. While some argue that payment is essential to sustain such work, others contend that extrinsic motivation can be toxic to the passion that drives many open-source contributors. The overall sentiment is one of respect for the maintainer's decision and a recognition of the difficult, often uncompensated, labor that underpins much of the software ecosystem.

## [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
**Score:** 248 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46414723

> **Article:** The article "Software engineers should be a little bit cynical" by Sean Goedecke argues that software engineers should adopt a "clear-eyed cynicism" to navigate corporate structures effectively. He contrasts this with both naive idealism (believing companies are purely mission-driven) and "doomerism" (believing companies are irredeemably evil).

Goedecke suggests that while companies ultimately exist to generate profit, their leadership often genuinely wants to build good products, but is constrained by market forces and organizational complexity. He advises engineers to accept that they are not the primary decision-makers, but rather translators of business strategy into technical implementation. By understanding the real motivations of management and the limits of their own influence, engineers can make meaningful contributions and improve their work environment without falling into disillusionment or burnout.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a split between those who find Goedecke’s pragmatic advice relatable and those who view it as too accommodating of systemic flaws. The consensus leans toward validating the need for cynicism as a defense mechanism, but there is significant debate regarding the nature of corporate leadership and the ethics of working for large tech companies.

Many commenters agreed that a baseline level of cynicism protects engineers from emotional burnout and helps them navigate "shitty feedback and communication cultures." However, several users argued that the article underestimates the bad faith of corporate leadership. Citing the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation and the singular focus on shareholder value, these users contended that "late-stage-capitalist" exploitation is a reality, not just a strawman. A recurring theme was the dismissal of C-suite executives as "super-powerful young children" who are detached from the reality of the products they ship, prioritizing status and revenue over software quality.

There was also a distinct philosophical divide on career strategy. While the article focuses on surviving as an employee, some commenters argued that the only winning move is to refuse to be an employee entirely—opting for consulting or entrepreneurship to regain autonomy. Ultimately, the discussion validated the article's core premise: engineers should be cynical to survive, but the degree of cynicism varies wildly based on personal experience with corporate ethics.

## [As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/28/nx-s1-5656190/ai-chips-memory-prices-ram)
**Score:** 235 | **Comments:** 347 | **ID:** 46415338

> **Article:** An NPR article reports that the massive demand for specialized chips from the AI industry is straining the global supply of memory (RAM) and other components, which will likely cause prices for consumer electronics like PCs and smartphones to rise. The article explains that as manufacturers prioritize high-margin AI hardware, the supply for standard consumer devices is squeezed. It notes that while new factories are being built to alleviate the shortage, they won't be operational for several years, meaning consumers should expect to pay more for devices in the near future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many users noting that high prices are already a reality. The conversation explores the mechanics, consequences, and potential responses to this market shift.

Several users confirm that prices for components like RAM are already "through the roof." The discussion clarifies that large corporations like Apple can shield themselves from immediate price hikes through long-term supply contracts, but smaller players and consumers will feel the impact sooner. A key point is that manufacturers are redirecting production capacity from consumer-grade memory (like LPDDR for phones) to high-margin, specialized memory (like HBM for AI servers), creating a supply bottleneck for the rest of the market.

The conversation then explores the downstream effects on the tech industry and consumers:
*   **Software Development:** One user posits a positive outcome: with hardware performance stagnating, developers will be forced to write more efficient, optimized software, similar to the clever optimizations seen at the end of old console generations. Another counters that this will accelerate a shift to centralized cloud computing, where economies of scale make powerful hardware more accessible, further eroding the viability of powerful local machines.
*   **Consumer Experience:** A user laments a "worrying trend" where budget PCs and phones are becoming less powerful (e.g., shipping with only 8GB of RAM) while prices increase. They argue the industry is regressing and prioritizing AI hype over fundamental user experience, which could be a "huge setback for humanity."
*   **Personal Computing:** This leads to concerns about the future of personal control over computing. Users express frustration with "enshittified" software and hardware lock-in, questioning how open-source developers can compete and how individuals can maintain control over their own machines.

Finally, there is a cynical view of the situation. Some users dismiss the price hikes as a "racket" or "mafia" scheme, blaming corporate greed and government inaction. One user offers a darkly humorous Soviet-era joke to summarize the likely outcome: when vodka gets more expensive, you don't drink less—you just eat less. Another user notes that unlike the fiber optic bubble, the current AI hardware is actually being put to use, suggesting this isn't a speculative overbuild but a fundamental shift in resource allocation.

## [Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should](https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46414819

> **Article:** The article "Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should" argues that Unity's long-standing use of an outdated version of the Mono runtime is a major performance bottleneck for developers. The author presents benchmarks showing that a simple C# data processing task runs approximately 20x faster when executed on modern .NET (CoreCLR) compared to Unity's current Mono implementation. The piece traces this issue back to Unity's historical reliance on Mono for its cross-platform capabilities and its subsequent failure to keep its fork updated with modern .NET improvements. The author notes that while Unity has announced a long-term roadmap to migrate to CoreCLR, the progress has been slow, leaving developers with a C# environment that fails to leverage the language's modern performance features.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the technical and historical reasons for Unity's performance issues and the slow pace of a solution. A key point of contention is whether the performance gains are relevant to release builds, as most professional Unity projects use IL2CPP for shipping. However, commenters clarify that the editor itself runs on Mono, and its sluggishness significantly impacts developer workflow, making the CoreCLR migration highly anticipated for productivity gains alone.

The conversation delves into the root causes of the performance gap. Multiple users point to the Garbage Collector, noting that Unity is stuck with the old Boehm GC while modern .NET and even standalone Mono have long since moved to more efficient, generational collectors. This leads to poor runtime performance and memory fragmentation issues that are difficult for developers to mitigate.

Historically, commenters blame Unity for its own predicament, refuting the narrative that Mono was the bottleneck. They recall that for years, Unity was slow to upgrade its Mono fork due to licensing disputes and then deflected criticism onto the Mono project. Now that both Mono and .NET are open-source and freely available, Unity's slow migration is seen as a result of internal technical debt and a lack of engineering focus.

Finally, the discussion contrasts Unity's approach with alternatives. Some suggest engines like Stride or Godot, which are already on modern .NET. Others critique Unity's proprietary performance solutions like the Burst compiler and IL2CPP, arguing they are complex "kludges" that lock users into Unity's ecosystem and often underperform compared to well-written, modern C# on CoreCLR. The consensus is that a move to CoreCLR is essential for Unity's future, but it's a massive undertaking for a company that has let its core technology stagnate for over a decade.

## [CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them? (2021)](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2023/05/ceos-salaries-expensive-automate-robots)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 273 | **ID:** 46415488

> **Article:** The article, originally from 2023, poses a provocative question: with the rise of AI, why not automate the role of the CEO to save on their exorbitant salaries? It argues that a sufficiently advanced AI could analyze vast amounts of business data to make strategic decisions, potentially outperforming many human executives who often rely on gut feeling or outdated information. The piece suggests that the primary barrier is not technical but cultural and structural, as the current system is designed to enrich a small group of executives. The author posits that an AI CEO could be programmed to optimize for metrics other than short-term shareholder profit, such as employee well-being or long-term sustainability, challenging the notion that the role requires a human touch.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely dismisses the article's premise, arguing that the role of a CEO is far less automatable than many other jobs. The consensus is that a CEO's primary function is not data analysis but human-centric tasks. Commenters emphasize that the job is built on "soft skills" like networking, building relationships with investors and the board, selling a vision, and providing leadership—all of which are deeply social and relational activities that current AI cannot replicate.

A significant portion of the debate centers on legal accountability. Users point out that fiduciary duties and other legal obligations are held by natural persons (directors and officers) and are non-delegable. This raises the critical question of who would be legally responsible for an AI CEO's decisions, a problem that no AI vendor would want to touch.

Beyond these practical objections, the discussion explores deeper economic and ethical concerns. One user argues that automating CEOs would simply shift the extracted surplus value from the CEO to the AI provider. Another user offers a cynical critique of the CEO class, suggesting they are overpaid and use PR to project an image of indispensability while actively working to devalue labor for others. The conversation also touches on the dystopian possibility that an AI CEO could be even more ruthlessly efficient in cost-cutting and workforce management than a human, and whether we should even want to build "psychopathic" AIs for such roles.

## [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46414475

> **Article:** The article "MongoBleed Explained Simply" details a critical information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2024-5687) in MongoDB. The bug is a classic use-after-free error where the database server, written in C++, fails to initialize memory before handing it out to clients. When memory is freed and immediately reallocated for a new task, the new client may receive a "bleed" of sensitive data from the previous user, such as authentication credentials, internal logs, or other private session data. The author notes that while the vulnerability was patched quickly, the timeline was confusing due to MongoDB's internal development process. The article concludes by suggesting that memory-safe languages or aggressive memory sanitization (like zeroing out freed memory) could prevent such bugs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: the root causes of the vulnerability, the practical reality of database security, and the state of memory-safe programming.

Many commenters linked the vulnerability to a broader culture of negligence. One highly upvoted thread argued that developers who choose MongoDB to "avoid figuring out a schema" are the same type of people who would expose a database directly to the internet to avoid setting up a secure internal network. This was supported by a Shodan scan showing over 200,000 publicly exposed MongoDB instances.

Technical discussion focused on prevention. A developer from Cloudflare shared that they mitigate these risks by overwriting all freed memory with a static pattern, effectively poisoning any uninitialized data. While some questioned if compilers would optimize this away, the consensus was that such defensive programming in C++ is a valuable practice. Other users debated why C++ doesn't zero memory by default, with the simple answer being performance, and noted that `calloc()` is the standard tool for that job.

Finally, there was some debate over MongoDB's response and internal processes. One user clarified that the confusing commit dates in the public repository were due to an internal-to-public sync process, and another corrected the author's timeline regarding Atlas cluster patching. The discussion concluded with a mix of cynicism about the inevitability of such bugs in memory-unsafe languages and a classic "web scale" joke.

## [PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python](https://pysdr.org/content/intro.html)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 11 | **ID:** 46413975

> **Article:** PySDR is an online guide that teaches the principles of Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Python. It is designed to be a practical, engineering-oriented resource that bridges the gap between academic theory and real-world implementation. The guide covers fundamental concepts and is noted for its use of cheap, accessible hardware (like the RTL-SDR) to make learning hands-on and affordable.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community overwhelmingly praised PySDR as an excellent and highly recommended resource. It was described as a go-to guide for both beginners and experienced professionals in the field. Commenters appreciated its practical approach, noting it was particularly effective for software engineers who may be less familiar with the underlying DSP theory.

While the reception was positive, a key point of constructive criticism was the guide's "hand-waviness" regarding certain theoretical details. One user pointed out that the author sometimes omits the complex theory behind specific engineering choices, leaving advanced learners without a clear path to understanding how to derive those parameters themselves. This highlights the resource's focus on practical application over deep theoretical exploration.

Finally, the discussion touched on the practicalities of getting started. The RTL-SDR was highlighted as the ideal, low-cost hardware for beginners, with users confirming that a small investment is enough to begin learning the basics.

## [Staying ahead of censors in 2025](https://forum.torproject.org/t/staying-ahead-of-censors-in-2025-what-weve-learned-from-fighting-censorship-in-iran-and-russia/20898)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 209 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** This article from the Tor Project forum, "Staying ahead of censors in 2025," details the technical evolution required to combat sophisticated state-level censorship in countries like Iran and Russia. The core problem is that censors have moved beyond simple IP/domain blocking to using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to identify the unique "handshakes" of Tor's pluggable transports. The article highlights two key strategies for the future:

1.  **Mimicry:** Instead of just making Tor traffic look random, new tools aim to perfectly mimic common, uncensored protocols. **WebTunnel** is an example that makes Tor traffic look identical to a standard HTTPS connection to a generic web server, making it nearly impossible for censors to distinguish it from legitimate traffic.
2.  **Conjure (Refraction Networking):** This advanced technique leverages unused IP address space within an Internet Service Provider's (ISP) network. A user's initial connection is routed to this "empty" IP, which is controlled by Tor. This handshake is indistinguishable from legitimate traffic to a non-existent server, completely bypassing IP-based blocking lists.

The overall goal is to force censors into a "collateral damage" dilemma, where blocking Tor would also break legitimate internet services for their population.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion branched into three main areas: the technical specifics, the legal and political context of censorship, and the practical user experience of censorship tools.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the technical landscape, particularly in China. Users debated the most effective tools, mentioning V2Ray, VLESS, and Trojan, and discussed the importance of using premium network routes like CN2 GIA to avoid throttling and poor performance. The "Conjure" technique was a point of interest, with one user highlighting that its success depends on ISP cooperation, which is unlikely in countries like Russia. Another user countered that Russian censors are often unconcerned with the collateral damage of blocking large IP ranges anyway.

The discussion also took a sharp turn into the legal and political dimensions of censorship. A user asked about the legal challenges of Tor providing software to sanctioned nations like Iran and Russia, sparking a debate on whether distributing free software constitutes "trade" under OFAC regulations. Many commenters expressed frustration that the article and the broader conversation focused on censorship in "enemy" states while ignoring what they see as growing free speech issues in Western allies like the UK and EU. They argued that the UK's high number of arrests for online speech makes it a form of censorship, but Tor, being partially US-government funded, would not criticize its allies. This led to speculation that China was omitted for similar political reasons. Finally, some users raised practical questions, such as how to configure Tor's Snowflake proxy on a desktop and expressing frustration with the difficulty of changing exit nodes to bypass geo-blocking.

## [Researchers discover molecular difference in autistic brains](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/molecular-difference-in-autistic-brains/)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46415129

> **Article:** Researchers from Yale University published a study in *The American Journal of Psychiatry* identifying a molecular difference in the brains of autistic individuals. Using a new EEG-based technique, they found that autistic brains have fewer mGlu5 receptors for glutamate, the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The study involved 16 autistic adults and 16 neurotypical controls. The researchers suggest this receptor deficit could be linked to the characteristics of autism and may offer a target for future interventions, though they emphasize the findings are preliminary and do not establish causality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was highly critical and skeptical of the study, focusing primarily on methodological weaknesses and the dangers of overgeneralization.

A significant portion of the critique centered on the study's small sample size (16 participants per group). Commenters argued that with such a small N, the results are highly susceptible to random chance and require replication before any claims can be made. Several users pointed out a critical design flaw: the study failed to properly match the control group to the autistic group, specifically noting a racial imbalance (100% of the autistic group was White, compared to 37.5% of the controls). This demographic mismatch was seen as a major confounding variable that undermines the study's validity.

Beyond statistical concerns, there was a strong theme of caution regarding the interpretation and application of the findings. Many commenters warned against simplistic "treatments," such as supplementing with glutamate precursors, explaining that brain chemistry involves complex homeostasis and such an intervention could be ineffective or even harmful. The discussion also highlighted the immense heterogeneity of the autism spectrum. Users argued that treating autism as a single, uniform condition is a fundamental flaw, and that meaningful progress requires categorizing and researching specific sub-phenotypes. The potential for the research to be misinterpreted or to fuel misguided "cures" was a recurring concern, with many commenters stressing that the receptor difference could be a consequence of living with autism rather than a root cause.

## [Rich Hickey: Thanks AI](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/ea94e3741ff0a4e3af55b9fe6287887f)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46415945

> **Article:** The linked content is a short, sarcastic note from renowned software engineer Rich Hickey, author of Clojure. Addressed to an AI, the note "thanks" the model for its "service" in generating "sloppy, derivative, and uninteresting" content. Hickey argues that this output is valuable because it makes the "mediocrity" of most human-generated content more apparent and easier to dismiss. He concludes by sarcastically suggesting that AI should continue this work, as it helps clear the "cognitive commons" by making it easier to identify and ignore low-quality information.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the ethics of AI, the quality of its output ("slop"), and the motivations of its critics. Many commenters, including some prominent developers, praised Hickey's note as a witty and necessary critique of the "AI slop" flooding the internet. They saw it as a welcome voice of reason from an respected elder, confirming their unease with the current AI hype cycle.

However, a significant counter-argument emerged, with some users accusing Hickey and other critics like Rob Pike of cynical "bandwagoning." This viewpoint suggests that these influential figures, many of whom have worked for or profited from major tech companies, are hypocritically ignoring the broader societal damage caused by the tech industry for years, only now finding a moral stance against AI's resource consumption and output quality.

Other key threads of discussion included:
*   The nature of AI's impact on software development, with some arguing that AI is effective at automating repetitive, low-imagination work, while others worry it encourages thoughtless code generation.
*   A debate over responsibility, with some commenters asserting that the fault lies with the people and corporations choosing to use AI tools, not the tools themselves, while others countered that the creators of these tools also share responsibility for their negative externalities.
*   A meta-critique of the discussion itself, with one user ironically using an LLM to rewrite Hickey's post to be more persuasive, and others pointing out that human-generated "slop" and polemics are hardly a new phenomenon.

## [No, it's not a battleship](https://www.navalgazing.net/No-its-not)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46413790

> **Article:** The article "No, it's not a battleship" on NavalGazing.net is a technical and historical critique of a proposal, attributed to Donald Trump, for a new class of massive, heavily armed US Navy warships. The author argues that the proposed vessel, which Trump has called a "battleship," is a fantasy that ignores the realities of modern naval warfare. The article explains that the term "battleship" refers to a specific historical class of ship defined by massive armor and large-caliber guns, a design made obsolete by aircraft carriers and guided missiles. The author dismisses the proposal's features (like railguns and lasers) as a "grab bag" of buzzwords and concludes that the ship is a "propaganda" piece, not a viable military concept, likely to be shelved when political attention wanes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical and dismissive of the proposed warship, viewing it as a political vanity project rather than a serious military proposal. The dominant sentiment is that the plan is a waste of taxpayer money, born from a lack of understanding of military procurement and strategy.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Political Folly and Inevitable Failure:** Many commenters believe the proposal is a superficial idea from Trump's staff that the Navy will simply outlast. It's described as "showboating" that will waste years and billions of dollars. The consensus is that the project will be quietly abandoned once the political administration changes or loses interest.
*   **Historical and Technical Absurdity:** Users with technical knowledge point out that the proposal ignores the evolution of naval warfare. The Zumwalt-class destroyer is mentioned as a real-world example of a technologically ambitious ship that became a costly failure. The proposal is compared to a "teenage armchair general's" dream or the "Homer" car from *The Simpsons*—a design full of cool-sounding but impractical features.
*   **Criticism of the Military-Industrial Complex:** Several comments tie the proposal to the broader issues of defense procurement. It's seen as another example of defense contractors influencing politicians for profit ("KA-CHING!") and a symptom of a US Navy procurement system that has been a "disaster" for decades.
*   **Satire and Mockery:** The proposal is met with heavy sarcasm. One user outlines a satirical SNL sketch mocking the ship's oversized claims, Trump's personal scandals (Stormy Daniels, Epstein), and the political opposition (Obama). Another user suggests naming it the "dread-yep" in a nod to the failed Swedish warship, the Vasa.
*   **Counterpoints:** A few users push back on the most extreme pessimism. One argues that while the specific proposal is bad, the underlying need for a capable navy to counter China is very real and shouldn't be dismissed. Another clarifies that a potential renaming of the Department of Defense to the Department of War is not legally possible and is just rhetoric.

> **Project:** The project is a web-based "bookshelf" application created using "vibe coding" with the AI tool Claude Code. The author demonstrates using an AI assistant to rapidly build a personal software project, resulting in a visually appealing and functional digital bookshelf. The project serves as an example of how AI can be used to create small, useful applications for personal use without deep, hands-on coding expertise.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion positively received the project as an ideal use case for "vibe coding"—using AI to build small, personal, single-user applications. Commenters highlighted that this approach is perfect for non-professional programmers or developers who want to quickly create tools for their own needs without getting bogged down in implementation details.

A key theme was the distinction between "vibe coding" for small projects and using AI assistance in larger, more complex software development. While vibe coding is great for one-off apps, larger projects require more human oversight, architectural planning, and explicit instructions to manage context and avoid bugs.

The conversation also touched on the evolving role of the human developer, with some arguing that "taste" and intent will remain key human contributions, while others were skeptical, noting that many people's taste is questionable. The project also sparked nostalgia for the classic Mac app "Delicious Library," which served a similar purpose.

## [Huge Binaries](https://fzakaria.com/2025/12/28/huge-binaries)
**Score:** 142 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46417791

> **Article:** The article "Huge Binaries" describes the author's experience with binaries exceeding 25 GiB in size, primarily due to the inclusion of debug symbols in large, statically-linked C++ projects. The author investigates why these binaries are so large, focusing on the technical challenges of the x86-64 architecture. Specifically, the 2 GiB limit on 32-bit relative jumps and calls forces the linker to use workarounds for code located farther apart. The primary solution is using the "large" code model (`-mcmodel=large`), which uses 64-bit absolute addresses, but this incurs a performance penalty by increasing register pressure and instruction size. The article explores alternative strategies like linker-ordered functions and profile-guided optimization to keep hot code close together, allowing the use of the more efficient "small" code model.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the shock and analysis of such massive binaries, with a general consensus that while debug symbols can be large, a 25 GiB binary indicates a significant engineering problem. Many commenters, including ex-Googlers, express frustration with the "infrastructure-first" culture at large tech companies, where the solution to bloat is to scale up hardware rather than address the root cause of the inefficiency. The conversation then delves into technical solutions and trade-offs. A key point is that C++ and its heavy use of templates are major contributors to binary and debug symbol size, and that dynamic linking offers limited relief. Commenters also discuss the role of modern tooling, questioning why Link-Time Optimization (LTO) isn't more effective at eliminating dead code and pointing to advanced tools like BOLT for post-link optimization. The overall sentiment is that while the problem is technically interesting, it's a symptom of unhealthy scale and that the "single binary" deployment model has practical limits.

## [62 years in the making: NYC's newest water tunnel nears the finish line](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/11/09/water--dep--tunnels-)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46415426

> **Article:** The article reports on the impending completion of New York City's Water Tunnel No. 3, a massive infrastructure project that has been under construction for 62 years. The tunnel, which will be 60 miles long and travel up to 800 feet underground, is designed to provide a new, independent supply of water to the Bronx and Manhattan (which already use it) and will soon extend to Brooklyn and Queens by its expected completion in 2032. The project is intended to allow for essential maintenance on the city's aging, century-old water tunnels, which currently cannot be shut down without causing a city-wide crisis.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of awe at the project's scale and duration, technical curiosity, and broader commentary on public infrastructure. A significant portion of the conversation is dedicated to technical questions and answers. Users wondered why the tunnel is being built so deep (800 feet), with the consensus being that it's necessary to maintain a downhill gradient for gravity-fed water flow from the reservoirs and to pass safely beneath existing city infrastructure. The immense energy required for such deep drilling was also a point of discussion.

Several users compared the project to its fictional depiction in *Die Hard 3*, noting its cultural resonance. A key debate emerged around the project's feasibility and cost versus alternatives like desalination. The prevailing argument is that while the upfront cost and time for a gravity-fed tunnel are enormous, its operational costs are negligible compared to the continuous energy and maintenance expenses of a desalination plant, making it a more sensible long-term investment.

The most critical comments focused on the political and bureaucratic challenges of modern infrastructure. Users contrasted the slow, deliberate pace of this essential public works project with the rapid, speculative development in the tech sector (like AI or the Metaverse). The discussion concluded that the primary obstacles to completing such projects are not technical but political, citing issues like corruption, graft, and the sheer difficulty of managing large-scale public works in a complex urban environment.

## [Show HN: My not-for-profit search engine with no ads, no AI, & all DDG bangs](https://nilch.org)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46417748

> **Project:** The project, "nilch," is a not-for-profit search engine frontend that emphasizes simplicity, privacy, and a clean user experience. It has no ads or AI features and includes support for all of DuckDuckGo's (DDG) bangs for quick redirection to other sites. The creator built it as a minimalist alternative to mainstream search, positioning it as a personal project that could potentially be sustained by donations, similar to Wikipedia. Currently, it functions as a wrapper around the Brave Search API rather than running its own index.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's response was a mix of encouragement, technical feedback, and philosophical debate. Many users appreciated the project's mission but were concerned about its long-term viability and technical foundation.

Key discussion points included:

*   **Technical Feasibility and Bugs:** Several users immediately encountered a "JSON.parse" error, which the creator quickly traced to exhausted API credits due to the high traffic from the HN post. Others pointed out that the project is currently a "thin wrapper" over Brave Search, not a true search engine. Suggestions were made to use open-source indexing projects like Marginalia Search for a more independent future. There were also feature requests, such as supporting DDG bangs in the middle of queries and adding autocomplete.

*   **Sustainability and Business Model:** A major theme was the difficulty of running a non-profit search service. Users discussed the costs of API calls and the necessity of a funding model. While the creator hopes for a donation-based "Wikipedia model," commenters debated the role of profit, arguing that it's essential for sustainability but that advertising-based profit is "corrosive." Suggestions included partnering with Ecosia, though the creator expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest.

*   **Openness vs. Security:** A sub-thread emerged about the pros and cons of an open-source ranking algorithm. One user argued this would give spammers a "recipe" to game the results, a point the creator acknowledged, suggesting potential workarounds like frequently changing algorithm weights.

*   **Philosophical Positioning:** The project was compared to others like SearxNG, with the creator clarifying that nilch's goal is extreme simplicity and a lack of unnecessary features. The discussion also touched on the broader need for competition and non-profit alternatives in the search engine space.
