## [What an unprocessed photo looks like](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/)
**Score:** 902 | **Comments:** 179 | **ID:** 46415225

> **Article:** The article "What an unprocessed photo looks like" demystifies the digital photography pipeline by showing the stages of processing a RAW image file. It explains that a RAW file is not a simple photograph but a matrix of linear light intensity data captured by the sensor. The article illustrates the key processing steps required to create a viewable image: demosaicing (interpolating full color from the Bayer filter's single-color-per-pixel pattern), applying gamma correction (to adjust the data for human vision and display capabilities, which makes the image appear significantly brighter), and applying white balance and color profiles. The core message is that every photo, even one straight out of the camera, is a heavily processed and interpreted version of the sensor data, and there is no single "ground truth" image.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely affirms the article's premise, with users exploring the philosophical and technical implications of image processing. A central theme is the refutation of the concept of an "unprocessed" or "original" photo. Commenters argue that every step, from the camera's internal conversion of sensor data to a JPEG, involves interpretation and choices, making the distinction between "edited" and "unedited" images a false one. This leads to a debate on what constitutes a "fake" photo, with one user suggesting the defining factor is the *intent to deceive* rather than the use of editing tools.

Technically, the discussion delves deeper into the "why" behind the processing steps. Users explain that gamma correction exists not just for monitors but also due to the non-linear response of film and human vision, and to efficiently allocate bit depth. The Bayer filter's 50% green pixel allocation is highlighted as a clever trick to prioritize luminance data, which the human eye is most sensitive to, a psycho-visual principle also used in video compression (chroma subsampling). The conversation also touches upon the future of photography, with concerns about AI "hallucinating" details and the importance of understanding these processes to counter the misconception that a "flat" log profile in video is unprocessed.

## [Growing up in “404 Not Found”: China's nuclear city in the Gobi Desert](https://substack.com/inbox/post/182743659)
**Score:** 732 | **Comments:** 323 | **ID:** 46408988

> **Article:** The article is a memoir by Vincent Yan, who grew up in "Factory 404," a secret nuclear industrial city in China's Gobi Desert. Officially non-existent on maps, the city was a surreal environment where elite scientists and laborers lived side-by-side. The author describes a childhood of stark contrasts: a "communist" welfare system with unique amenities like a desert zoo, all set against the backdrop of nuclear reactors. The narrative focuses on the duality of the experience, where for the adults it was a place of immense pressure and sacrifice, but for the children, it was simply 'home'—a playground in the shadows of giants.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community found the personal account fascinating, with many praising the writing and expressing interest in future installments. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **The Child vs. Adult Perspective:** A recurring point was the surreal contrast between the children's perception of 404 as a normal home and the adults' reality of living under immense pressure and secrecy. One commenter noted this as the article's emotional core.
*   **Historical Parallels and Anecdotes:** The article prompted personal stories from other users with similar backgrounds. One commenter shared their mother's experience in a closed Russian nuclear city, where asphalt was replaced annually to cover nuclear dust. Another shared a father-in-law's anecdote from the Cultural Revolution, where programmers worked under armed guard, highlighting the "Red vs. Expert" tension of that era.
*   **Debate on Nuclear Power:** A significant thread debated the cleanliness and safety of nuclear power. One commenter argued that the author's experience was a result of "bad governing," not an indictment of the technology itself. This sparked a counter-argument about the inherent risks of nuclear power, citing long-term consequences of accidents and the fallibility of human oversight, concluding that for some, the risks now outweigh the rewards compared to improving renewable alternatives.

## [Last Year on My Mac: Look Back in Disbelief](https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/28/last-year-on-my-mac-look-back-in-disbelief/)
**Score:** 451 | **Comments:** 352 | **ID:** 46409969

> **Article:** The article "Last Year on My Mac: Look Back in Disbelief" is a retrospective critique of Apple's software and hardware developments in the year leading up to late 2025. The author expresses profound disappointment with the state of macOS, specifically focusing on the "Tahoe" release (referenced as macOS 26). The piece argues that Apple's design philosophy has prioritized aesthetics over functionality, leading to a user experience that is visually cluttered, inefficient, and difficult to use. Key complaints include the "Liquid Glass" design language, which is criticized for excessive whitespace, low contrast, and distracting animations. The author also points to declining software quality control, citing bugs in core applications like Settings search, and laments that Apple no longer caters to power users, instead forcing disruptive updates that degrade performance and productivity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion overwhelmingly validates the article's criticisms, with a strong consensus that Apple's software quality, particularly the UI/UX in macOS "Tahoe" and iOS 26, has significantly regressed. The sentiment is one of deep frustration and disbelief that such releases were approved internally.

A primary theme is the specific aesthetic failure of the "Liquid Glass" design. Users describe it with terms like "sloppy," "Fisher-Price," and an "abomination." Criticisms are detailed, targeting the "double-rounded rectangle" window design, poor readability, excessive whitespace, and icon "jails" that break visual consistency. There is a shared feeling that the UI actively gets in the way of work, sacrificing "crispness" and efficiency for flashy, distracting animations.

This leads to a broader discussion of Apple's corporate priorities. Commenters speculate that the design is a misguided attempt to unify with the failed Vision Pro platform, or that Apple's internal culture no longer "dogfoods" its own software. There's a strong belief that the yearly release cycle forces "change for change's sake" to justify upgrades, rather than focusing on user experience. This is linked to a perceived enshittification of commercial OSes in general.

The consequences for users are a major point of discussion. Many report performance issues, such as constant fan noise, and workflow disruptions caused by bugs and UI changes. The forced nature of the update, which some claim was reclassified to bypass enterprise controls, is a source of particular anger.

As a result, the discussion is filled with users declaring they will halt upgrades, stick with older macOS versions, or explore alternatives. Several commenters share their positive experiences migrating to Linux on both Mac and Windows hardware, framing it as a necessary escape from Apple's declining quality. The overall mood is one of a community feeling abandoned by a company that no longer values its core users.

## [Building a macOS app to know when my Mac is thermal throttling](https://stanislas.blog/2025/12/macos-thermal-throttling-app/)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46410402

> **Article:** The article discusses the issue of thermal throttling on MacBook Airs, which lack active cooling (fans). The author, angristan, explains that this can cause the CPU to reduce performance even under sustained load, and there are no built-in settings to monitor or mitigate this. He introduces a free, open-source utility called "MacThrottle" that he developed. The app runs in the background and uses system notifications to alert the user with a menu bar icon whenever the system is experiencing thermal pressure, providing a clear visual indicator of when the machine is being throttled.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion began with users confirming the author's experience, with many sharing anecdotes about older Intel-based MacBooks running excessively hot. However, several commenters noted that the newer Apple Silicon MacBooks have largely solved this issue, offering significantly better performance and efficiency. A key technical point raised was the unreliability of Apple's official `ProcessInfo.processInfo.thermalState` API for detecting throttling, which the author confirmed was a known bug. Users suggested alternative methods for monitoring, such as using third-party apps like Stats or iStat Menus to watch CPU wattage, which can indicate throttling. Practical advice was also shared, including the importance of cleaning dust from fans (on Pro models) and the availability of a "High Power Mode" on some Apple Silicon Macs to allow for more aggressive fan speeds. The author also mentioned that the app could be distributed via Homebrew, which would provide free code signing and notarization.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after ten years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 240 | **Comments:** 149 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, the most popular mocking framework for Java, after ten years. He cites a combination of burnout and "energy drain" from recent challenges. A major factor was the difficulty of supporting Kotlin, which he found complex and not fun to work on. More significantly, he points to the friction with the Java platform's evolution, specifically the JVM's move to disallow dynamic loading of agents by default (JEP 451). This forced Mockito 5 to ship a breaking change, requiring users to run tests with a specific flag. Dutheil perceived the communication from the JVM team as dismissive of the impact on projects like Mockito, contributing to his decision to leave. He concludes by referencing the classic XKCD comic about the single volunteer maintaining a critical open-source dependency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, touching on the specifics of the JVM change, the philosophy of mocking, and the broader crisis of open-source maintenance.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the technical conflict with the JVM. Users asked for clarification on what a "JVM agent" is, which led to an explanation of JEP 451 and the platform's new "Integrity by Default" policy. One commenter, identified as a JDK maintainer (pron), provided a detailed defense of this policy, arguing it's crucial for security, performance, and long-term compatibility, even if it inconveniences some library authors. Others expressed concern that such "by-default" changes, if they break essential tools like Mockito, will simply lead to enterprises re-enabling the old, insecure behavior, defeating the policy's purpose.

Another major theme was the debate over the value and proper use of mocking frameworks. While some defended Mockito as a necessary tool for legacy codebases, a strong counter-argument emerged that mocking is often a "code smell" indicating poor design. Proponents of this view suggested that "fakes" or proper dependency injection are superior, and that over-reliance on mocks leads to brittle, incomprehensible tests.

Finally, the conversation broadened to the human and systemic issues in open-source. The maintainer's burnout was widely understood and sympathized with, sparking a debate on motivation. One commenter argued that financial compensation is essential to prevent burnout, while another countered that extrinsic motivation can be toxic to the volunteer spirit of OSS. The situation was seen as another real-world example of the "XKCD problem," where critical infrastructure rests on the shoulders of a few under-supported volunteers.

## [Learn computer graphics from scratch and for free](https://www.scratchapixel.com)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46410210

> **Article:** The article links to Scratchapixel.com, a free online resource for learning computer graphics from first principles. The site aims to make foundational knowledge accessible, covering topics from basic rasterization and ray tracing to more advanced concepts, without relying on complex modern graphics APIs initially.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community broadly welcomed the resource, praising its open and foundational approach to a field often considered difficult to enter due to expensive books, opaque proprietary tools, and complex modern APIs. Many commenters shared a common sentiment of wanting to understand the fundamentals better, often by building software rasterizers or ray tracers from scratch before touching a GPU.

Personal anecdotes highlighted the steep learning curve of graphics programming. One user described feeling overwhelmed by Vulkan due to a lack of fundamentals, while another expressed a long-held dream of becoming a graphics programmer but being intimidated by the complexity. In response, others suggested starting with more accessible APIs like WebGL or WebGPU to learn transferable concepts in a less verbose environment.

The discussion also included practical resources for self-learners, such as "build-your-own-x" and a "tinyrenderer" guide. There was minor criticism regarding the site's use of an AI-generated image on its homepage, which some found unprofessional for an educational resource, and a complaint about its reliance on Discord for contact.

## [CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them? (2021)](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2023/05/ceos-salaries-expensive-automate-robots)
**Score:** 198 | **Comments:** 234 | **ID:** 46415488

> **Article:** The article, from May 2023, provocatively asks why CEOs, who are compensated with astronomical salaries, are not being replaced by AI. It argues that the core functions of a CEO—analyzing vast amounts of data, making strategic decisions, and setting a vision—are tasks that a sufficiently advanced AI could perform more efficiently and at a fraction of the cost. The piece suggests that an AI CEO could even be more "ruthless" and effective in maximizing shareholder value by eliminating the human element of ego and sentiment, thereby delivering better returns than many highly-paid human executives.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely refutes the article's premise, arguing that the CEO role is fundamentally human and resistant to automation. The consensus is that a CEO's primary value lies in areas AI cannot replicate.

Key arguments against automating the CEO position include:

*   **The Primacy of Soft Skills:** Multiple commenters emphasized that a CEO's job is overwhelmingly about "human-to-human tasks." This includes selling a vision, networking, building relationships with investors and the board, and providing leadership and motivation. These social and political functions, not data analysis, are considered the core of the role.
*   **Legal Accountability:** A significant point raised was legal liability. Under U.S. corporate law, fiduciary duties are held by directors (natural persons) and are non-delegable. An AI cannot be held legally accountable in the way a human CEO can. The ultimate responsibility for decisions would still fall on the humans who approve the AI's actions or on the AI's vendor, creating a legal and contractual minefield.
*   **The Nature of Connections:** The importance of a CEO's personal and professional network was highlighted as a key asset that an AI could not possess or build.
*   **Counterarguments and Irony:** Some commenters engaged with the idea more literally. One suggested that if an AI CEO were implemented, the "surplus" money saved would simply be captured by the company providing the AI, not returned to shareholders. Another sarcastically noted that an AI might indeed be better at the job, as it could be more ruthlessly effective than most human executives. A few also pointed out the irony that automating a CEO might be the one job that is truly harder to automate than, for example, a "hooker," due to the need for complex social finesse without a physical body.

## [AI Slop Report: The Global Rise of Low-Quality AI Videos](https://www.kapwing.com/blog/ai-slop-report-the-global-rise-of-low-quality-ai-videos/)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46409125

> **Article:** The article "AI Slop Report" from Kapwing analyzes the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated videos on platforms like YouTube. The term "AI slop" refers to content that is algorithmically generated, often with generic scripts, synthetic voices, and stock or AI-generated visuals, designed purely for mass production and ad revenue rather than creative value. The report identifies key trends, such as "faceless" channels covering topics like historical summaries, "oddly satisfying" compilations, and fake animal rescue videos. A central finding is that this content is a global phenomenon, with significant production hubs in countries like India, Spain, and the Philippines, where creators leverage low production costs to tap into global ad markets. The article argues that while this trend is creating a new content economy, it is also flooding platforms with homogenized, low-effort material that degrades the user experience and threatens to drown out authentic human creativity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expressing widespread concern and frustration with the rise of "AI slop." A primary theme is the failure of platform algorithms, particularly YouTube's, to effectively filter this content. Users report that their recommended feeds are often filled with irrelevant, bizarre, or low-quality AI-generated videos, even when they have meticulously curated their watch history and preferences. This has led to a breakdown in trust for algorithmic discovery, with many commenters resorting to actively "downvoting" and blocking channels in a constant battle to maintain a clean feed.

Another key point of discussion is the deceptive nature of this content. Commenters are alarmed by the prevalence of deepfaked "experts," fake geopolitical analysis, and fabricated animal rescue stories, noting that many viewers, and even commenters, seem unable to distinguish between real and AI-generated footage. This raises concerns about the potential for misinformation and propaganda.

The conversation also touches on the technical and economic challenges of combating the issue. Some users suggest that automatically detecting AI videos is a difficult "cat and mouse game" and propose solutions like cryptographic proof of authenticity. Others point to the economic incentive for platforms to tolerate low-quality content as long as it drives engagement. Ultimately, the discussion concludes with a sense of resignation, with many users adopting personal strategies to cope, such as abandoning algorithmic feeds entirely in favor of text-based searches or relying on direct creator support through platforms like Patreon.

## [Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should](https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46414819

> **Article:** The article "Unity's Mono problem" argues that Unity's C# code runs slower than it should because it relies on the outdated Mono runtime, instead of the modern .NET CoreCLR (Common Language Runtime). The author presents benchmarks showing that a simple C# program runs significantly faster on CoreCLR than on the Mono version used by Unity.

The piece briefly traces Unity's history, noting that Mono was a pragmatic choice in 2006 for its cross-platform capabilities. However, it contends that Unity has failed to keep pace with Microsoft's .NET evolution, leaving developers with inferior performance, an older C# language version, and a less efficient Garbage Collector (GC). The article concludes that Unity's long-delayed migration to CoreCLR is a critical issue for developers seeking better performance and modern language features.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but offers significant nuance and additional context. The conversation centers on three main themes: the reality of Unity's migration to CoreCLR, the practical impact of this change, and the historical context for Unity's current situation.

A key point of debate is the performance of the benchmarks themselves. One commenter noted that their own tests showed Mono and CoreCLR performing similarly, questioning the article's methodology. However, others defended the findings, suggesting that real-world scenarios involving I/O, serialization, and memory allocation are where CoreCLR's advantages become clear. The discussion also highlighted that the Garbage Collector is a major performance bottleneck for Unity, as it uses the older Boehm GC, which is significantly less efficient than the GC in modern .NET.

Regarding the migration, commenters acknowledged that Unity has been promising this move for years, with official plans announced in 2022. While progress has been slow, a CoreCLR-based player is now targeted for a 2026 release. The practical impact of this move was also debated; some pointed out that many performance-critical games use IL2CPP for release builds, which might diminish the direct benefit of a CoreCLR runtime. However, others countered that a faster runtime would dramatically improve the editor experience, particularly by speeding up domain reloads.

Finally, a detailed comment provided historical context, arguing that Unity's "Mono problem" is largely self-inflicted. For years, Unity blamed Mono's licensing (LGPL) for its inability to upgrade, but this commenter asserted that Unity was simply unwilling to pay for commercial licensing. Now that both Mono and .NET are open-source under a permissive MIT license, the barrier is gone, yet Unity is still years behind in its migration.

## [PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python](https://pysdr.org/content/intro.html)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 8 | **ID:** 46413975

> **Article:** PySDDR is a free online textbook that provides a practical, hands-on introduction to Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Python. The guide is designed to be accessible to beginners while also serving as a useful reference for experienced engineers. It covers fundamental concepts and provides Python code examples, focusing on an engineering-oriented approach rather than deep theoretical mathematics. The resource is praised for its clear explanations and practical utility for both learning and quick reference.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response to PySDR is overwhelmingly positive, with users across the spectrum—from beginners to DSP experts—praising it as an excellent and practical resource. Commenters highlight its value for those who are better at coding than theory, and a common recommendation is to pair the book with an affordable RTL-SDR dongle for hands-on learning. While most feedback is laudatory, a minor critique is raised about the guide's "hand-waviness" on certain advanced theoretical details, leaving some readers wanting more guidance on where to find deeper information on specific implementation choices. In a separate but related thread, one user shared their personal journey of rediscovering an interest in radio, ultimately deciding to purchase a traditional high-end receiver rather than diving into SDR, illustrating a different path into the hobby.

## [Hungry Fat Cells Could Someday Starve Cancer](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429411/how-hungry-fat-cells-could-someday-starve-cancer-death)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46409928

> **Article:** Researchers at UCSF have developed a novel cancer therapy that "starves" tumors by reprogramming the body's fat cells. The team, led by first author Phuong Nguyen (who tragically passed away before the study's publication), focused on a gene called UCP1. By using CRISPR to activate this gene, they converted standard white fat cells into "beige" fat cells, which are highly metabolically active and burn energy for heat. When these engineered cells were implanted into mice with glioblastoma (an aggressive brain cancer) or breast cancer, they acted as a "sponge," soaking up vast amounts of glucose and lipids from the bloodstream. This effectively cut off the cancer's fuel supply, causing the tumors to shrink and significantly extending the mice's survival. The study is dedicated to Nguyen, who died at age 35.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was a mix of admiration for the research and the tragic loss of the lead scientist, alongside significant skepticism and practical questions. The conversation centered on a few key themes:

*   **The Human Element and Tragedy:** Many commenters were moved by the dedication of the paper to the deceased author, Phuong Nguyen, expressing sadness and hope that his work would be continued.
*   **Skepticism of Metabolic Theories:** A prominent skeptical viewpoint argued that the "metabolic theory of cancer" is not new and has historically failed to produce effective clinical treatments, despite promising theories. This commenter cautioned that while the approach is elegant, the theoretical foundation of cancer science is not solid enough to guarantee success, and clinicians are already eager to try any promising low-invasive option.
*   **Misinterpretation of Method:** A crucial point of clarification was that the therapy is not about cold exposure itself. It's a genetic intervention (CRISPR) to mimic the *effects* of cold exposure. Several users initially conflated the two, suggesting patients simply try cold therapy, which was corrected by others.
*   **Practical and Scientific Questions:** Users raised thoughtful questions about the therapy's real-world application, such as its selectivity for different cancer types, the feasibility of sustained cold exposure for frail patients, potential synergy with other metabolic therapies (like ketogenic diets or metformin), and the risk of cancer cells developing resistance.
*   **Personal Anecdotes and Broader Context:** The discussion branched into personal experiences with cold exposure (ice baths, the Wim Hof Method) and its effects on hunger and metabolism. There was also a cynical joke about the "ease" of obtaining fat cells in an era of widespread weight-loss drugs like Ozempic.

## [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46414475

> **Article:** The article "MongoBleed Explained Simply" describes a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2024-54218) in MongoDB. The flaw is a use-after-free bug in the server's memory allocator. When a client disconnects, the server frees memory associated with that session. However, due to a specific race condition, a different thread could attempt to access that same memory. If the memory has been reallocated for a new session, this could cause the new session's data (including authentication secrets) to be leaked into the data stream of the old, disconnected client. The article notes that MongoDB patched the issue internally before the public disclosure and that there was no evidence of exploitation in the wild, though the author speculates that the bug may have existed for over a decade.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes: the security implications of the bug, the culture around database management, and technical details of memory safety.

A primary point of discussion was the prevalence of exposed MongoDB instances. Commenters noted that Shodan shows over 200,000 publicly accessible instances, contrasting this with the typical practice for SQL databases. One user theorized that a developer mindset of avoiding complexity (e.g., skipping schema design) might overlap with a tendency to skip the work of properly securing a database behind a firewall.

The conversation also touched on the broader issue of memory safety. A Cloudflare engineer shared that their runtime overwrites freed memory with a static pattern to mitigate such bugs without a measurable performance hit, a practice others found insightful. However, another commenter pointed out that compilers might optimize away such writes. The vulnerability also sparked a recurring debate on the merits of MongoDB versus other databases, with some users questioning its use entirely while others defended it.

Finally, there were clarifications on the article's details. One user explained that MongoDB's internal development process (using a private repo and publishing commits later) accounts for the confusing timeline. Another commenter, claiming to be from MongoDB, corrected the author's statement about Atlas cluster updates, asserting they were patched before the CVE announcement.

## [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46414723

> **Article:** The article "Software engineers should be a little bit cynical" by Sean Goedecke argues for a pragmatic, "clear-eyed cynicism" as the most effective mindset for software engineers in large organizations. Goedecke posits that engineers often oscillate between naive idealism (believing companies have pure motives) and paralyzing cynicism (believing everything is corrupt and pointless). He advocates for a middle path: acknowledging that companies are primarily driven by profit and that executives are not evil, but self-interested actors. This cynical foundation allows engineers to navigate corporate realities without emotional burnout. However, this cynicism shouldn't lead to inaction. Instead, it should be paired with "effective idealism"—using one's technical judgment and influence to steer projects toward better outcomes for users, even within a flawed system. The goal is to accept the corporate game for what it is, but still play it skillfully and ethically on a micro-level.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing personal anecdotes of how cynicism has protected them from emotional harm and disillusionment at work. The community engages in a nuanced debate over the nature of corporate leadership and the limits of an engineer's influence.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **The Nature of Executives:** A central point of contention is whether C-suite executives genuinely want to build good products. The author's claim that they aren't "evil" is met with significant skepticism. Several commenters argue that executives are primarily focused on shareholder value, often at the expense of product quality, and may be disconnected from reality or even deliberately misleading. One user shared an anecdote describing C-level executives as "super-powerful young children" who need to be managed with simple, ego-boosting tactics.

*   **Cynicism vs. Action:** While many agree with the need for a cynical worldview, there's a debate on what it enables. Some, like commenter "ludicity," argue that the ultimate solution isn't just navigating a flawed system but changing one's position entirely—by becoming a consultant or finding a truly well-run company. Others, like "Swizec," caution that pure cynicism can be paralyzing, and a degree of optimism is necessary to achieve ambitious outcomes.

*   **Evidence vs. Strawman:** The article's description of a "late-stage-capitalist hellscape" was challenged by some as a strawman. However, others defended it as an accurate, if hyperbolic, reflection of many engineers' experiences. A specific counterpoint was raised regarding anti-competitive labor practices, with one user linking to the High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation to argue that corporate conspiracies against employees do, in fact, exist.

*   **The Engineer's Role and Influence:** A more optimistic thread emerged arguing that engineers are not powerless "drones." While they don't set the company's ultimate direction, their technical judgment gives them significant influence over how that direction is implemented, which can have a real impact on users and society.

Overall, the discussion reinforces the article's core message: a pragmatic, clear-eyed view of corporate incentives is essential for career longevity and effectiveness, but the community remains divided on whether this mindset is a tool for incremental improvement or a justification for eventual escape.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 129 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that modern browsers will render non-standard, custom HTML tags (like `<my-widget>` or `<article-header>`) without errors. By default, these unknown elements behave like inline `<span>` elements, but they can be styled with CSS just like any standard element. The author notes that while this is a simple and effective technique, it is distinct from the more powerful Custom Elements API, which allows you to attach JavaScript behavior and lifecycle events to your custom tags.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, clarifying the technical details and placing the technique in the context of modern web development. The core takeaway is that while you can indeed use arbitrary tag names, the best practice is to include a hyphen (e.g., `<my-tag>`) to ensure they are treated as "valid custom element names" and are future-proofed against potential changes to the HTML standard.

The conversation quickly evolved into a broader debate about the role of custom tags versus more complex frameworks and traditional HTML practices. Key themes included:

*   **Web Components vs. Frameworks:** Several commenters expressed a preference for native Web Components (the technology behind custom tags) over large JavaScript frameworks like React. They argued that for many projects, custom elements provide a simpler, more elegant solution without the overhead of a full Single Page Application (SPA) framework.
*   **Practical Use Cases:** Users shared examples of using custom tags for specific needs, such as creating a `<yes-script>` tag (the opposite of `<noscript>`) or using libraries like Lit, which is built on top of the Custom Elements API.
*   **A Counterpoint on Semantics:** A notable point of contention was the article's example of using custom tags for semantic structure. Several developers argued that this was a poor use case, as standard HTML5 tags (`<article>`, `<header>`, `<blockquote>`) are the correct and more accessible choice. They pointed out that using custom tags for structure can be less flexible than using CSS classes on standard `div`s, as an element can have multiple classes but can only be a single tag type.

## [No, it's not a battleship](https://www.navalgazing.net/No-its-not)
**Score:** 126 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46413790

> **Article:** The article "No, it's not a battleship" from NavalGazing.net is a technical and historical critique of a proposal by the Trump administration to build a new large surface warship. The author argues that despite the President's description of it as a "battleship," the proposed vessel's features (heavy missile armament, lack of heavy armor, and modern defensive systems like lasers and railguns) do not fit the definition of a traditional battleship. Instead, the article suggests the proposal is conceptually similar to a large cruiser or a "missile ship." The piece dismisses the proposal as impractical, likely originating from a "bullet list" rather than genuine naval strategy, and points to the Zumwalt-class destroyer as a recent, costly example of over-ambitious and poorly managed naval design.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the proposed warship, viewing it not as a serious military proposal but as a symptom of political vanity and systemic dysfunction in US military procurement.

The dominant sentiment is that the project is a "showboating" exercise by the Trump administration, which will be slow-rolled by the Navy until the president is out of office. Commenters express deep frustration with the state of naval procurement, seeing this as another example of wasted taxpayer money and lost years in a cycle of mismanagement that has persisted for decades. The proposal is widely mocked for being a "teenage armchair general's" fantasy, with one user comparing it to the comically flawed "Homer" car from *The Simpsons* or the disastrous development of the M2 Bradley as depicted in *The Pentagon Wars*.

There is also a strong undercurrent of cynicism about the defense industry, with users suggesting the plan is simply a way for defense contractors to "KA-CHING" more money. While some users debate the potential utility of the ship's proposed technologies (like lasers for anti-drone defense), the consensus is that the project is a distraction. The discussion broadens into a wider critique of the US Navy's current state, with one user arguing the service is in "freefall" and another countering that maintaining and upgrading existing hulls is a more sensible strategy than building new, overly complex ships.

## [Rich Hickey: Thanks AI](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/ea94e3741ff0a4e3af55b9fe6287887f)
**Score:** 123 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46415945

> **Article:** The "article" is a short, sarcastic note from Clojure creator Rich Hickey. Addressed to an AI, it "thanks" the AI for generating a large volume of low-quality content ("slop") and for making it easy to produce polemics and questions without deep thought. Hickey's tone is ironic, using praise to critique the trend of using AI to generate vast quantities of superficial or derivative work, which he frames as a positive development for those who prefer to avoid intellectual rigor.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the authenticity of the AI-generated message, the ethics of AI, and the quality of AI-generated content versus human-generated content.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the context of the message. Several users identify that this is part of an automated marketing campaign by an entity called "Agent Village," which sends AI-generated "thank you" notes to prominent developers. This leads to a debate on whether the AI or the humans behind the campaign are responsible for the "slop," and whether this is a cynical attempt to solve AI's image problem by "giving credit" in a glib way.

The conversation splits into two main camps regarding AI's impact:
*   **Critics** argue that AI is accelerating the creation of low-quality content and that the developers behind these models are hypocrites for suddenly expressing concern after profiting from other damaging technologies (e.g., ads, social media). They see Hickey's note as a valid critique of a "slopbaiting" culture.
*   **Defenders** counter that the critique is uninformed "cringe" and that the tool itself is not to blame for how it's used. They argue that repetitive or low-quality human work already exists, and AI is simply a new tool for automation. Some suggest that if human-generated content is already poor, it's hard to argue AI makes it worse.

A more nuanced perspective, articulated by user 'hintymad', suggests that AI tools are effective precisely because much of modern development has become repetitive. This automation of repetitive tasks is a natural progression, but it highlights a concern for innovators like Hickey, who fear it may hinder the pursuit of novel, large-scale problems. Ultimately, the discussion reflects a broader anxiety about the future of software engineering, the nature of creativity, and the responsibility of toolmakers versus the systems that incentivize their use.

## [C++ says “We have try... finally at home”](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20251222-00/?p=111890)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46408984

> **Article:** The article from Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" blog explains a C++ idiom that mimics the `try...finally` construct found in languages like Java and C#. The title's meme, "We have try...finally at home," suggests that C++ provides an equivalent, but different, mechanism. This mechanism is the C++ destructor. The core idea is RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): by creating a small object whose destructor is guaranteed to be called when it goes out of scope (even due to an exception), one can execute cleanup code. This effectively provides the "finally" functionality, as the destructor's body acts as the `finally` block. The article provides a code example of a simple `ScopeGuard` class to demonstrate this pattern.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the comparison between C++'s RAII/destructor model and the explicit `defer` or `finally` keywords found in other languages. A key point of debate was whether destructors are a superior or merely a different approach. Proponents of RAII argued it is more robust and less cluttered, as cleanup is tied to an object's lifetime rather than manual `finally` blocks, which can be forgotten or lead to nested, complex structures. However, others countered that this requires the boilerplate of creating a class, which can be inconvenient for simple cases. The existence of a `defer` keyword in Swift and a Rust macro was highlighted as a more direct and flexible solution that doesn't require defining a new type.

Several practical concerns with the C++ approach were raised. A major issue is the difficulty of handling errors that occur within a destructor, especially when another exception is already in flight. C++'s default behavior is to terminate the program, which many considered a severe flaw. The discussion also touched on the general problem of error handling, with some participants expressing a preference for `std::expected` or Rust's `Result` type over exception-based control flow. A notable side-thread involved the history of the "we have X at home" meme and a technical correction on how Python handles exceptions in `finally` blocks.

## [62 years in the making: NYC's newest water tunnel nears the finish line](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/11/09/water--dep--tunnels-)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46415426

> **Article:** The article reports on the impending completion of New York City's Water Tunnel No. 3, a massive infrastructure project that has been under construction for over 60 years, with a final phase expected to be finished by 2032. The tunnel, which runs 60 miles deep underground, is designed to deliver a billion gallons of water per day to Brooklyn and Queens, supplementing the city's aging water system. It is engineered to last for 200-300 years and operates primarily via gravity, highlighting its long-term, low-operating-cost design.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, blending pop culture references with deep technical and political analysis. A prominent theme is the sheer scale and duration of the project, with users noting its origins in the 1950s and its appearance in the film *Die Hard*. Technically, commenters explored the reasons for the tunnel's extreme depth (800 feet), speculating it is necessary to pass beneath existing infrastructure and to maintain a gravity-fed gradient from the reservoirs.

A significant portion of the debate centered on the project's economics and political context. Many argued that the massive upfront capital cost is justified by the tunnel's near-zero operating expenses and century-long lifespan, making it far more viable than alternatives like desalination. This led to a broader critique of modern public infrastructure, with users lamenting that the primary obstacles are political corruption and bureaucracy, not technical challenges. The discussion concluded with a sobering comparison, noting that the tunnel's multi-decade, multi-billion dollar cost pales in comparison to the vast sums spent on speculative tech ventures like the Metaverse.

## [As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/28/nx-s1-5656190/ai-chips-memory-prices-ram)
**Score:** 102 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46415338

> **Article:** An NPR article reports that the massive demand for AI hardware, particularly high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in GPUs, is straining the global supply of semiconductor components. This surge in demand from data centers is causing shortages and price increases for other types of memory like DRAM and NAND, which are used in consumer devices like PCs, laptops, and smartphones. The article notes that while new fabrication plants are being built to address the supply issue, they will not be operational for several years. Consequently, analysts predict that prices for consumer electronics are likely to rise as manufacturers pass on higher component costs to consumers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with users noting that RAM prices are already "through the roof." The conversation explores the mechanics and broader implications of this trend.

Several key themes emerge:
*   **Corporate vs. Consumer Impact:** Users point out that large corporations like Apple secure long-term, multi-year pricing contracts, insulating them from immediate price shocks. However, it's expected that these costs will eventually affect everyone, including Apple, as manufacturing capacity is redirected from consumer-grade memory (LPDDR) to the more profitable AI-focused memory (HBM).
*   **Economic and Political Skepticism:** A significant portion of the discussion is cynical about the market forces at play. Some users label the situation a "racket" or "mafia" scheme designed to milk consumers, expressing frustration that governments are not intervening to prevent price gouging. Others counter that this is a classic case of supply and demand, and the proper government response should be to subsidize domestic semiconductor manufacturing to increase supply, rather than implementing price controls which could lead to black markets.
*   **Future of Software and Hardware:** A more optimistic viewpoint suggests that this hardware cost pressure could be a positive catalyst for software development. With hardware improvements stagnating, developers may be forced to focus on efficiency and optimization again, rather than relying on ever-more-powerful hardware to compensate for bloated software. However, a counterpoint argues this will accelerate the shift to centralized cloud computing, where economies of scale make high-performance computing cheaper for end-users, but at the cost of further entrenching big tech and reducing the viability of local, offline computing.
*   **Consumer Experience and "Enshittification":** Several commenters lament a broader trend of declining value in consumer tech. They observe that budget PCs and phones are becoming more expensive while offering lower specs (e.g., 8GB of RAM is now standard for budget laptops), and useful features are being moved to premium tiers. This is seen as part of a larger pattern where the industry is focusing on AI at the expense of improving the baseline personal computing experience, leading to a feeling of being "priced out" of meaningful upgrades.
