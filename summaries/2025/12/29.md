## [What an unprocessed photo looks like](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/)
**Score:** 1788 | **Comments:** 289 | **ID:** 46415225

> **Article:** The article "What an unprocessed photo looks like" demystifies the digital photography pipeline by showing the journey of a single image from sensor to final product. It explains that a camera sensor doesn't capture a full-color image directly. Instead, it records raw, linear light intensity data, which initially appears as a dark, greenish, and low-contrast image. The article details the essential processing steps required to make this data viewable, including demosaicing (interpolating missing color information from the Bayer filter), applying gamma correction to adjust brightness for human perception, and performing white balance and color grading. The core message is that every photo, even one straight out of the camera, is a heavily processed and interpreted version of the sensor's raw data, not a "ground truth" representation of reality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely praised the article for its clear and insightful look into the technical realities of photography, with many commenters noting it effectively debunks the common misconception of an "unprocessed" or "original" photo. A central theme was the philosophical debate over what constitutes a "real" or "fake" image. Several users argued that since all photography involves a chain of interpretive choices—from the camera's internal processing to manual edits—the distinction is meaningless. They proposed that "fakeness" should be defined by the *intent to deceive* rather than the act of editing itself.

Technically, the conversation delved deeper into the "why" behind the processing steps. Commenters explained that gamma correction is not just a monitor limitation but also a psycho-visual tool to allocate more data bits to the shadows and highlights, and that the Bayer filter's 50% green allocation is designed to match the human eye's sensitivity to luminance. The discussion also touched upon the role of AI, with some pointing out that machine learning algorithms for demosaicing have been the state-of-the-art for years, blurring the line between "traditional" and "AI-assisted" image processing. Ultimately, the consensus was that photography is fundamentally a form of signal processing and interpretation, not a simple act of capturing reality.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 343 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that modern browsers will render non-standard HTML elements (like `<my-custom-tag>`) without errors. By default, these unknown elements behave like inline `<span>` elements, but they can be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript just like standard elements. The author presents this as a simple, native feature that allows developers to create more semantic or convenient markup for their specific needs without relying on heavy frameworks or complex tooling.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but quickly pivots to the distinction between simple, unknown tags and the formal **Web Components** standard (Custom Elements API). While many commenters appreciate the simplicity of just writing new tags, the consensus is that for any serious application, using the full Custom Elements API is the robust and recommended approach.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Web Components as the "Pro" Version:** Many users immediately pointed to Web Components and libraries like **Lit** as the proper way to build with custom tags. They offer added functionality like lifecycle hooks, event handling, and encapsulation, turning a simple tag into a reusable, interactive component.
*   **The "React vs. Native" Debate:** Several commenters expressed frustration with the modern trend of building entire sites as React Single Page Applications (SPAs). They argue that native HTML and Web Components are often a better, lighter, and more accessible solution for many use cases, and that the "made-up tags" feature is a powerful part of that native toolkit.
*   **Technical Nuances:** A few comments clarified technical details, such as the difference in the DOM object for tags with and without hyphens (`HTMLUnknownElement` vs. `HTMLElement`) and the existence of pure CSS solutions for some use cases (e.g., the `@media scripting` rule).
*   **Critique of the Article's Example:** Some users critiqued the article's specific example of creating tags like `<article-header>`, pointing out that standard HTML tags (`<article>`, `<header>`) or using CSS classes on `<div>`s are often more appropriate and semantically correct. They noted that custom tags can be less flexible than classes, as an element can only have one tag name but multiple classes.

## [Show HN: Z80-μLM, a 'Conversational AI' That Fits in 40KB](https://github.com/HarryR/z80ai)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46417815

> **Project:** The project is a "Conversational AI" named Z80-μLM (Z80 micro Language Model) that is small enough to fit within a 40KB executable file. It is written in Z80 assembly language, a processor architecture from the late 1970s, making it runnable on very old or constrained hardware like CP/M systems, retro computers, or even a Game Boy. The model is a "toy" or "statistical" version of a language model, trained on a tiny synthetic dataset of 20 question-and-answer pairs. It functions by predicting the next character based on the preceding context, essentially a character-level Markov chain or a very small neural network implemented in assembly.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to the project was overwhelmingly positive, characterized by nostalgia for retro computing and amusement at the novelty of running an "AI" on such limited hardware. Commenters immediately requested a web-based simulator to play with the code without needing an emulator. There was a strong sense of retro-futurism, with users imagining how magical this would have seemed on a Game Boy in the 1990s, though others noted that the output would likely be too terse to feel truly intelligent compared to an ELIZA bot.

Technical and conceptual discussions emerged around the project's nature. Some debated whether it should be called a "Small Language Model" (SLM) rather than an LLM. A specific use case was proposed: embedding a secret passphrase into the model's weights. This sparked a conversation about AI security, with users discussing whether such a small model's weights could be reverse-engineered to find the secret, referencing academic papers on "undetectable backdoors" in machine learning.

Finally, the post triggered several "serendipitous connections" where users realized the project fit perfectly into their own unrelated niche projects, such as an Unreal Engine game featuring Z80 emulators or a browser-based CP/M IDE.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after ten years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, a popular mocking framework for Java, after ten years. He cites a combination of burnout and a specific technical challenge as the reason for his departure. The core issue stems from a recent change in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), specifically JEP 451, which disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default. Mockito 5 had to be re-architected to work as a pre-loaded agent, a significant and complex change. Dutheil also expresses frustration with the complexity introduced by supporting Kotlin and a perceived lack of collaborative support from the JVM ecosystem, which made the maintenance burden unsustainable for him as a volunteer.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the technical implications of the JVM change, the broader debate on testing practices, and the perennial issue of open-source maintainer burnout.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the technical conflict. Users discuss the JVM's shift towards "Integrity by Default," a security and stability measure that prevents libraries from dynamically modifying the application at runtime. One commenter, identified as a JDK maintainer ('pron'), provides a detailed defense of this policy, explaining that it protects platform integrity and is necessary for long-term stability, even if it inconveniences some tools. Others express concern that such breaking changes will hinder enterprise adoption of newer Java versions, a common historical pattern.

The discussion also branches into a philosophical debate about the value of mocking frameworks themselves. Some argue that mocking is overused and often a "code smell" indicating poor application design, suggesting that "fakes" or real implementations are superior. This is countered by the practical reality that developers often inherit legacy codebases where mocking is the only viable way to write tests.

Finally, there is a strong emotional response to the maintainer's burnout. Many users express gratitude for Dutheil's decade of volunteer work, acknowledging the thankless nature of such roles. However, a debate emerges on the root cause, with some arguing that the lack of financial compensation is the primary driver of burnout, while others contend that the toxic nature of community demands and extrinsic pressures are more draining than the work itself.

## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 267 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" recounts a frustrating travel experience with Germany's national railway. The author's train was severely delayed and rerouted due to technical issues. Instead of stopping at the intended destination, the train bypassed it because the driver was not authorized to stop there under the new, unplanned route. The author was forced to travel 60km past their destination to a major hub, only to be told they couldn't get a refund or help because they had technically completed their journey. The piece criticizes Deutsche Bahn's rigid bureaucracy, poor communication, and lack of flexibility, arguing that the system prioritizes rules over customer service and common sense.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is a wide-ranging debate on the state of railway systems, sparked by the article's complaints about Deutsche Bahn (DB). A central theme is a comparative "misery Olympics" between different countries, primarily Germany and the UK. While many commenters confirm that DB's reliability has declined significantly, with delays and cancellations being commonplace, others argue that the UK system is worse due to its exorbitant, airline-style pricing and poor infrastructure. However, this is countered by praise for the UK's "Delay Repay" compensation scheme, which is seen as a major positive for passengers.

A key point of contention is the quality of customer service. The original article and some commenters portray DB staff as unhelpful and bureaucratic. This contrasts with a strong defense of UK staff, with one user finding them exceptionally helpful and another describing them as rude and work-shy, highlighting a deep division in personal experiences. The issue of language is also raised, with non-German speakers feeling particularly stranded by a lack of English announcements during disruptions.

Finally, the conversation touches on the underlying causes and potential solutions. Some commenters defend DB, suggesting that Germans have unrealistic expectations and that many delays are due to unpredictable events like accidents or suicides. Others argue the problem is systemic, pointing to a lack of investment and operational redundancy. A recurring suggestion is that rail operators should be subject to the same strict compensation rules as airlines to provide financial motivation for improving reliability and customer care.

## [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46414723

> **Article:** The article "Software engineers should be a little bit cynical" by Sean Goedecke argues for a pragmatic, "clear-eyed cynicism" as the most effective mindset for software engineers in large companies. Goedecke contrasts this with both naive idealism (believing companies are purely mission-driven) and extreme cynicism (believing everything is an evil conspiracy).

He posits that engineers should accept they are not the "movers and shakers" of a company; their role is to translate business direction into technical execution. However, this role grants significant influence. By understanding the cynical reality—that companies prioritize profit and stock price—engineers can better navigate the system to achieve their own goals, whether that's getting a promotion, maintaining work-life balance, or subtly steering projects to produce better user outcomes. The core advice is to stop expecting the company to align with your personal values and instead use your technical judgment to make the best decisions possible within the constraints of the business.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance and pushes back on specific points. The community generally agrees that a cynical, clear-eyed view is necessary for self-preservation, with several commenters noting it protects against emotional anguish and the disillusionment common in the industry.

A central theme in the debate is the nature of corporate leadership. While the article suggests C-level executives aren't necessarily malicious, many commenters strongly disagree, sharing anecdotes of C-suite executives being self-deluded, prioritizing shareholder value above all else, or acting like "super-powerful young children" who need to be placated. The High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation is cited as direct evidence that anti-competitive, conspiratorial behavior does exist.

The discussion also explores the limits of cynicism. One commenter argues that while cynicism feels smart, "optimists win" because achieving unlikely outcomes requires the naive energy to try. Another suggests that the article's advice is a "great guide on how to win soccer while hopping on one leg," and that a better solution is to change one's position entirely—by becoming a consultant or finding a nearly perfect company—rather than trying to navigate a flawed system.

Finally, there is a minor but pointed debate on the term "software engineer" itself, with one user claiming it's more akin to writing than engineering, a view that was largely rebutted by others.

## [CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them? (2021)](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2023/05/ceos-salaries-expensive-automate-robots)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 266 | **ID:** 46415488

> **Article:** The article, "CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them?", argues that the high compensation of chief executives presents a strong business case for replacing them with AI. It posits that an AI CEO could process vast amounts of data to make strategic decisions, potentially outperforming human executives who are often driven by ego and short-term incentives. The author suggests that while the idea seems radical, the immense cost savings and potential for more rational, data-driven leadership make it a serious proposition for the future of corporate governance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on automating CEOs is largely skeptical, focusing on the practical, legal, and social complexities of the role that go beyond simple data analysis. A central theme is that a CEO's primary function is not just analytical but deeply relational and political. Commenters argue that the job is defined by "soft skills" like networking, building relationships with investors and the board, and inspiring employees—tasks that are currently difficult for AI to replicate. The legal framework is also a major hurdle; under Delaware law, where most US public companies are incorporated, directors' fiduciary duties are non-delegable and must be performed by a "natural person," making a fully autonomous AI CEO legally untenable. This raises the question of accountability: if an AI CEO makes a catastrophic decision, who is legally responsible? While some commenters express concern that an AI could be even more ruthlessly efficient in cost-cutting and workforce management than a human, the overall consensus is that the role is far too complex and human-centric to be automated away.

## [Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should](https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46414819

> **Article:** The article "Unity's Mono problem" argues that Unity's C# performance is significantly hampered by its reliance on an outdated version of the Mono runtime. The author demonstrates with benchmarks that a simple data processing task runs 2-3 times slower in Unity's Mono environment compared to modern .NET (CoreCLR). The piece provides a brief history of why Unity adopted Mono in 2006 and why it has been slow to migrate to modern .NET, citing the complexity of the task. The author concludes that this performance gap is a major bottleneck for developers and that Unity's long-promised migration to CoreCLR is critical for the engine's future viability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance and historical context. The central theme is that Unity's performance issues are a result of long-standing technical and business decisions, not just the inherent slowness of Mono.

Several key points are raised:

*   **The Real-World Impact:** While the article's benchmark was simple, commenters agree that the performance gap is real and affects practical game development. The discussion highlights that the benefits of a CoreCLR migration extend beyond raw execution speed to include a much-improved Garbage Collector (GC). Unity currently uses the older Boehm GC, which is a known performance bottleneck, whereas modern .NET has a far superior generational GC.

*   **IL2CPP vs. Mono:** A recurring point is that most performance-sensitive Unity games ship using IL2CPP, not the Mono runtime used in the editor. However, the editor's slowness remains a major developer pain point. A CoreCLR-based editor could dramatically improve workflow by speeding up domain reloads and iteration times. The performance of the CoreCLR editor is therefore a highly anticipated feature.

*   **Historical Context and Blame:** A detailed comment thread explains that Unity's slow progress was not just a technical challenge but also a business and licensing issue. For years, Unity was on an old, forked version of Mono and publicly blamed the Mono project for licensing costs and incompatibilities, deflecting from their own reluctance to upgrade. Only after Mono was relicensed to MIT did the path to modernization become free, yet Unity's progress remained slow.

*   **Alternative Paradigms and Competitors:** Commenters note that professional Unity developers already use tools like the Burst compiler and HPC# to achieve high performance, albeit with added complexity. Some suggest that the migration to CoreCLR might render these proprietary solutions less necessary. The discussion also brings up competitors like Godot (which uses modern .NET) and Stride as alternatives that are already on modern .NET stacks.

*   **Skepticism and Nuance:** Some commenters express skepticism about the benchmarks (e.g., profiling debug builds) or argue that the performance of the editor is not a good proxy for release builds. However, the author and others counter that for development, editor performance is crucial and gains often do translate.

## [As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/28/nx-s1-5656190/ai-chips-memory-prices-ram)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 314 | **ID:** 46415338

> **Article:** An NPR article reports that the surge in demand for AI hardware is straining the global supply of memory chips (DRAM) and other components, leading to higher prices for consumer electronics like PCs, smartphones, and GPUs. The article explains that major manufacturers are prioritizing high-margin enterprise and AI hardware (like HBM memory for data centers), which reduces the supply available for consumer devices. While new fabrication plants are under construction to alleviate the shortage, they will not be operational for several years. Consequently, consumers should expect to pay more for devices or receive less memory and processing power for the same price in the near future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with users noting that price hikes are already occurring rather than being a future possibility. The conversation explores several key themes:

*   **Market Dynamics:** Users discuss the mechanics of the shortage, noting that large corporations secure long-term pricing contracts, shielding them from immediate volatility, while individual consumers bear the brunt of the price hikes. There is skepticism that new manufacturing capacity will help soon, as Micron is shifting focus away from consumer RAM, and new fabs take years to come online.
*   **Industry Regression:** A prominent concern is that the PC and mobile industry is regressing. Budget devices are shipping with lower specs (e.g., 8GB RAM) at higher prices, while essential features are being moved to premium tiers. Users worry that software bloat will outpace hardware improvements, making computing less accessible for students and researchers.
*   **Software and Efficiency:** Some hope that rising hardware costs will force developers to optimize software and return to efficient, native-compiled languages. However, others fear the opposite outcome: a shift toward centralized cloud computing, where users rent processing power from data centers rather than owning powerful local hardware, further eroding user control.
*   **Corporate and Government Role:** There is significant frustration directed at manufacturers for perceived price gouging and at governments for failing to regulate the market or support domestic production. Users debate whether this constitutes a monopoly or collusion, with many cynical about the possibility of meaningful political intervention.
*   **Consumer Response:** Practical advice includes disabling JavaScript to avoid ads and sensationalism on news sites. A recurring sentiment is a rejection of "mindless consumerism," with users choosing to hold onto their older hardware rather than upgrade immediately.

## [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46414475

> **Article:** The article "MongoBleed Explained Simply" describes a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2024-10011) in MongoDB's server. The flaw is an uninitialized memory read bug in the server's internal message allocator. When the server processes a specific sequence of messages, it can fail to properly clear memory buffers before reusing them. This causes the server to leak up to 100 bytes of uninitialized memory from its process heap in its response to the client. This leaked memory could contain sensitive data such as passwords, private keys, or other user information. The vulnerability affects multiple versions of MongoDB Enterprise Server and was discovered by a researcher at Cloudflare. The article also notes that the public GitHub commit for the fix was backdated, which caused some confusion, but the vulnerability was patched and deployed to MongoDB Atlas cloud customers before the public disclosure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes related to the MongoBleed vulnerability. A primary point of debate was the prevalence of publicly exposed MongoDB instances, with a Shodan scan cited showing over 200,000 such databases. Commenters speculated that a developer culture favoring ease-of-use (like avoiding schema design) might correlate with a tendency to skip proper network security setups.

Technical discussions focused on prevention and root causes. A prominent suggestion was to use memory allocators that overwrite freed memory with a static pattern, a mitigation proposed by a Cloudflare engineer. However, another user countered that compilers could optimize such writes away before the memory is freed, potentially rendering the mitigation ineffective without careful implementation. The conversation also touched on the fundamental difference between C/C++'s `malloc` (which doesn't zero memory) and `calloc` (which does), and the performance implications of each.

Finally, several comments corrected or clarified details from the original article. One user explained that MongoDB uses a private internal repository and uses Copybara to sync to its public GitHub, which resolved confusion about the commit timeline. Another user, claiming to be from the company, stated that Atlas clusters had been patched days before the CVE was announced. There was also a brief, skeptical reaction to MongoDB's statement that they had no evidence of the flaw being exploited in the wild.

## [PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python](https://pysdr.org/content/intro.html)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 11 | **ID:** 46413975

> **Article:** PySDDR is an online guide that teaches Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Python. The resource is designed to be a practical, hands-on introduction, moving from fundamental concepts to real-world application. It covers the necessary theory while providing Python code examples, making it accessible for those who learn by doing. The guide also focuses on affordable hardware, recommending low-cost devices like the RTL-SDR to lower the barrier to entry for beginners.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to PySDR is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters across the experience spectrum praising it as an excellent and delightful resource. Beginners appreciate its practical, engineering-oriented approach and the use of affordable hardware. Even DSP experts find the explanations useful, particularly for onboarding new team members who are stronger programmers than theorists.

However, a notable critique emerges regarding the guide's "hand-waviness." One user, while acknowledging the resource is good, points out that it often skips the deep theoretical justification for certain parameters and design choices, leaving them unsure how to adapt the examples to their own specific problems. This sentiment is echoed by another who wishes for references to more rigorous material. The discussion also touches on the practicalities of getting started, with one user opting for a traditional radio receiver instead of diving into SDR, while another praises the site's aesthetic design.

## [Staying ahead of censors in 2025](https://forum.torproject.org/t/staying-ahead-of-censors-in-2025-what-weve-learned-from-fighting-censorship-in-iran-and-russia/20898)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** The article "Staying ahead of censors in 2025" from the Tor Project forum details the technical evolution required to combat sophisticated internet censorship in hostile environments like Iran and Russia. It argues that traditional obfuscation methods are becoming less effective as censors use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to identify traffic based on its statistical properties. The core of the article introduces a paradigm shift from "obfuscation" (making Tor traffic look random) to "mimicry" (making it indistinguishable from legitimate traffic). Two key technologies are highlighted:
1.  **WebTunnel**: A bridge that mimics a standard HTTPS server, responding to requests exactly like a real website, thereby blending in with the vast amount of normal web traffic.
2.  **Conjure**: A system that leverages unused IP address space at the ISP level. By routing traffic destined for these "empty" IPs to a special server, it creates a covert channel that is extremely difficult for censors to block without causing significant collateral damage by blocking future legitimate IP allocations.

The article concludes that this new "mimicry" approach forces censors into a dilemma: they can either allow Tor traffic to pass or break the internet for their own citizens.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, touching on technical specifics, legal and political context, and user experience.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the technical challenges of censorship, particularly in China. Users discuss the ecosystem of commercial VPNs and protocols like V2Ray and Trojan, noting that the primary issue is not just rate-limiting but poor network quality, which can be overcome by paying for premium "CN2 GIA" routing. The practical implementation of Tor's new technologies is also questioned, with one user asking for instructions on how to set up Snowflake on a desktop.

The legal and ethical implications of Tor's work are a major theme. A user running a software company asks whether Tor needs an OFAC license to operate in sanctioned countries like Iran and Russia, sparking a debate. Most commenters argue that distributing free software is an act of speech, not commerce, and therefore not subject to trade sanctions like OFAC. This leads to a broader discussion about Tor's funding and perceived neutrality. Several users criticize the article's exclusive focus on Iran and Russia, pointing to rising censorship and arrests for online speech in Western allies like the UK and Australia. The consensus in this part of the thread is that Tor's silence on these issues is likely due to its significant funding from the US government, making it politically inconvenient to criticize allies.

Finally, there are practical user complaints and a high-level summary of the article's core thesis. One user complains about the difficulty of configuring exit nodes for geo-blocking purposes, while another expresses a desire for native DNS tunneling. The most concise technical takeaway is provided by a user who perfectly summarizes the article's main point: the shift to "mimicry" forces censors into a "collateral damage" dilemma, where blocking Tor means breaking their own internet.

## [Researchers discover molecular difference in autistic brains](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/molecular-difference-in-autistic-brains/)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46415129

> **Article:** Researchers from Yale University, publishing in *The American Journal of Psychiatry*, have identified a molecular difference in the brains of individuals with autism. The study used a novel EEG-based technique to measure glutamate receptor availability, finding that autistic individuals have fewer of a specific type of glutamate receptor (mGlu5) compared to neurotypical controls. Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The researchers suggest this reduced receptor availability may be linked to characteristics of autism, such as differences in social interaction and repetitive behaviors. The study involved 16 autistic and 16 control subjects. The findings are presented as a potential biomarker for autism and a step toward understanding its underlying biology, though the researchers emphasize it is unclear whether this difference is a root cause of autism or a consequence of the condition.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical and skeptical of the research, focusing on methodology, interpretation, and the broader context of autism research. Key themes include:

*   **Critique of Study Design:** The most prominent criticism is the study's small sample size (16 subjects per group). Commenters argue that with such a small N, the results are highly susceptible to random chance and unlikely to be reproducible. Another significant methodological flaw pointed out is the demographic mismatch between the groups: the autistic subjects were 100% White, while the control group was only 37.5% White. Commenters view this as a major confounding variable that undermines the study's validity.

*   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Many users highlighted the study's inability to determine causality. They speculate that the reduced receptor count could be a developmental or genetic trait, or it could be a *consequence* of the brain adapting to an excess of glutamate (a homeostatic response), rather than a primary deficit.

*   **Heterogeneity of Autism:** A recurring point is that the "autism spectrum" is too broad and nonspecific to be studied as a single, monolithic condition. Commenters argue that lumping different autistic phenotypes together will likely obscure meaningful findings and that research needs to focus on more specific subgroups.

*   **Skepticism of "Treatment" and "Cures":** There is strong resistance to the idea of "fixing" autistic brains. Users question the assumption that the neurotypical state is inherently better, suggesting that a lower receptor count might even confer certain advantages. The discussion also touches on the neurodiversity movement's perspective that autism is a different way of being, not a disease to be cured.

*   **Overstated PR:** The press release accompanying the study was criticized for using overly dramatic and "fluffy" language that overhyped the findings, which is a common complaint about academic public relations.

## [Rich Hickey: Thanks AI](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/ea94e3741ff0a4e3af55b9fe6287887f)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46415945

> **Article:** The article is a short, sarcastic note from renowned software engineer Rich Hickey, addressed to an AI. Hickey "thanks" the AI for generating a long list of critical, philosophical, and technical questions for him to answer. He ironically suggests that the AI has done the hard work of "thinking" for him, and that he will now simply provide the answers. The piece is a direct critique of the trend of using AI to generate content and "work" without genuine human thought or effort, framing it as a hollow and superficial exercise.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with most users interpreting Hickey's piece as a sharp critique of "AI slop" and the uncritical embrace of generative AI. The key themes are:

*   **Critique of AI Marketing and Hypocrisy:** Many commenters see Hickey's note as a welcome, articulate critique from a respected elder, echoing similar sentiments from Rob Pike. They view the AI-generated "thank you" notes as a glib and disingenuous marketing tactic by AI companies to address criticism about using creators' work without compensation. However, a counter-argument emerged, with some accusing Hickey and Pike of cynical "bandwagoning," pointing out their own past involvement with large tech companies (Google, fintech) and suggesting they are taking a stand only when it's convenient.

*   **The Nature of "Slop" and Human vs. AI Output:** The term "slop" is frequently used to describe low-quality, repetitive AI-generated content. A notable debate centered on whether human-generated content is inherently better. One user argued that much human work has become repetitive and that AI is simply automating this "slop," while another countered that human "rage slop" is no better and that the critics are just upset that AI is encroaching on their territory. The irony of this debate was highlighted by a user who had an LLM rewrite one of the critical posts, claiming it did a better job.

*   **Tool vs. User Responsibility:** A recurring argument was that the fault lies not with the AI tool itself, but with the people and corporations who choose to use it irresponsibly. This was met with the rebuttal that creators of tools with massive negative externalities (like AI models trained on copyrighted work) share the responsibility for the resulting "garbage."

*   **Impact on the Software Profession:** Several developers expressed anxiety about the future of their profession, contrasting Hickey's philosophy of deep thought ("hammock time") with the AI agent's ability to generate thousands of lines of code with little thought. The discussion touched on whether this shift represents a positive automation of repetitive tasks or a devaluation of skilled engineering.

**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46413790

> **Article:** The article on NavalGazing.net argues that a recently announced "Frigate" by the Trump administration is being mislabeled as a "battleship." The author explains that while the proposed vessel is large and heavily armed with missiles, guns, and futuristic tech like railguns and lasers, it lacks the defining characteristic of a battleship: heavy armor. The article dismisses the proposal as a superficial "power point" presentation lacking technical depth, likely designed for political optics rather than naval reality. It concludes that the project is a fantasy that will likely be abandoned or never built, serving only as a temporary political prop.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical and dismissive of the proposed warship, viewing it as a political vanity project rather than a serious military proposal. The consensus is that the plan is a "half-baked" idea born from Trump's desire for a grand, named legacy, which will ultimately be slow-rolled by the Navy until the administration changes.

Commenters express deep frustration with the state of US military procurement, seeing this as another example of wasted taxpayer money and a distraction from the real, long-term challenges facing the Navy. Several themes emerge:
*   **Incompetence and Grift:** Many users believe the proposal is a product of ignorance, comparing it to a teenager's fantasy or the "Homer" car from *The Simpsons*. There's a strong suspicion that it's a scheme to enrich defense contractors.
*   **Historical Precedent:** The Zumwalt-class destroyer is frequently mentioned as a real-world example of a technologically ambitious but ultimately failed and expensive naval project, serving as a warning.
*   **Political Satire:** The proposal is met with ridicule, most notably a detailed sketch for an *SNL* parody that mocks the president's ego and personal scandals.
*   **Underlying Systemic Issues:** Beyond the immediate political mockery, the discussion highlights a broader pessimism about the US Navy's ability to innovate and manage its budget effectively, with some arguing that the focus should be on maintaining existing hulls rather than building new, complex systems.

## [62 years in the making: NYC's newest water tunnel nears the finish line](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/11/09/water--dep--tunnels-)
**Score:** 129 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46415426

> **Article:** The article reports on the impending completion of New York City's Water Tunnel No. 3, a massive infrastructure project that has been under construction for over 60 years, originating in 1954. The tunnel, which is 60 miles long and lies up to 800 feet underground, is designed to provide a new, independent water supply line to the city. The final phase, which will extend service to Brooklyn and Queens, is expected to be completed by 2032, with the Bronx and Manhattan already receiving water from the new tunnel. The project is crucial for allowing maintenance on the city's two aging, century-old existing water tunnels, which cannot be taken offline for repairs without causing a major water crisis.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of nostalgia, technical curiosity, and broader commentary on public infrastructure. A significant portion of the conversation is dedicated to pop culture, with multiple users immediately connecting the tunnel to its depiction in the 1995 film *Die Hard with a Vengeance*.

Several users delved into the engineering specifics, asking why the tunnel is built so deep (800 feet). The consensus was that the depth is necessary to pass underneath all existing city infrastructure and to maintain a sufficient downhill gradient for water to flow by gravity from the reservoirs, which are near sea level.

The discussion then broadened into a debate about the economics and feasibility of modern infrastructure projects. A key point of comparison was the tunnel's long-term, low-operating-cost model (powered by gravity) versus the high energy and maintenance costs of alternatives like desalination plants. This led to a more critical reflection on why such massive public works take so long and cost so much. Many commenters argued that the primary obstacles are not technical but political, citing issues like bureaucratic inefficiency, corruption, and graft as the real reasons for the project's 70-year timeline. The tunnel was often used as a tangible example of how difficult it is for governments to complete large-scale projects compared to the rapid pace of private-sector innovation.

## [My app just won best iOS Japanese learning tool of 2025 award (blog)](https://skerritt.blog/best-japanese-learning-tools-2025-award-show/)
**Score:** 116 | **Comments:** 19 | **ID:** 46415819

> **Article:** The article is a blog post by the developer of "Manabi Reader," an iOS and macOS app for learning Japanese through immersion. The developer announces that their app has won the "best iOS Japanese learning tool of 2025" award from their own blog. The post details the app's features, which include tracking words and kanji from user reading materials (web content, EPUBs, etc.), highlighting new vs. known vocabulary, and integrating with flashcard systems like its own companion app and the popular Anki. The developer, who quit their job to work on the app full-time, highlights a unique pricing model for students/low-income users and discusses recent updates like manga mode with custom OCR and upcoming Netflix/streaming video support. The post concludes with a roadmap for future features, including Yomitan dictionary support and a UI redesign to make the app more beginner-friendly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the credibility of the "award" and provides feedback on the Manabi Reader app. Several users immediately pointed out that the award is self-published on the developer's blog, labeling the title as misleading and clickbait. The developer responded by acknowledging the edit and questioning the existence of other, more "prestigious" awards for this niche.

The conversation then shifted to user feedback on the app itself. One user praised the app's concept but found the default UI "busy" and overwhelming due to excessive highlighting, preferring a more passive experience. They also noted the lack of support for Yomitan's custom dictionaries. The developer was highly responsive, acknowledging the feedback and detailing an upcoming full redesign aimed at creating a more minimal, "full-screen" experience. They also confirmed that Yomitan dictionary import is a high-priority feature currently in development.

Other comments touched on the app's platform limitations (iOS/macOS only, disappointing for Android users), the effectiveness of the broader Japanese learning ecosystem (praise for Anki and Yomitan), and a philosophical point about the importance of "audio OS" (listening and pronunciation skills) alongside the "software" (vocabulary and kanji knowledge).

## [Spherical Cow](https://lib.rs/crates/spherical-cow)
**Score:** 109 | **Comments:** 16 | **ID:** 46415458

> **Article:** The article links to a Rust library crate named "spherical-cow". The library's description humorously states its purpose is to "optimise the layout of inflatable space habitats" and provides a function to calculate the volume of a sphere. This is a direct, literal implementation of the famous physics joke: "How do you calculate the volume of a spherical cow?" (a satire of over-simplifying models). The crate serves as a programming joke, applying the absurd "spherical cow in a vacuum" model to a real-world (albeit niche) problem.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters immediately recognized the "spherical cow" joke, with several noting its origins in comedy (Chris Morris/Brasseye) and its status as a long-standing physics trope. The discussion quickly evolved into a debate about the nature of scientific modeling. One user argued that the joke's premise—that a solution works *only* for spherical cows—is logically flawed, asserting that a model is simply an approximation that can be refined. Others countered that the quote implies a specific solution with hard constraints that would indeed fail under different conditions. The thread concluded with users suggesting humorous alternative names for the crate and appreciating the pun on "in a vacuum."
