## [What an unprocessed photo looks like](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/)
**Score:** 2204 | **Comments:** 359 | **ID:** 46415225

> **Article:** The article "What an unprocessed photo looks like" demystifies the process of digital photography by showing the stages of image creation from raw sensor data to a final image. It explains that a camera sensor doesn't capture color, only light intensity. To capture color, a Bayer filter (a grid of red, green, and blue filters) is placed over the sensor, meaning each pixel only records one color. This raw, single-channel data is then processed through several steps: demosaicing (interpolating the missing two colors for each pixel), applying gamma correction (to make the linear data appear correctly on a non-linear monitor), and white balance adjustments. The article uses a specific photo example to visually demonstrate these stages, arguing that what we consider a "photo" is the end result of significant signal processing, not a direct capture of reality.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely praises the article for its clear and insightful look into the technical reality of digital photography. A central theme is the philosophical debate over what constitutes a "real" or "fake" photo. Several commenters argue that since every image, even one straight from a camera, is a heavily processed and interpreted version of reality, the concept of "fake" is misleading. Instead, they suggest the distinction should be based on intent to deceive. The conversation also delves deeper into the technical details, with users explaining the psycho-visual reasons for the Bayer filter's green-heavy pattern (matching human eye sensitivity) and the necessity of gamma correction for efficient data allocation and monitor compatibility. There is some concern about the future of photography, with AI-driven processing and "hallucination" of details seen as the next frontier that further blurs the line between capture and creation.

## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 747 | **Comments:** 737 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" is a personal narrative detailing a disastrous travel experience with Germany's national railway. The author's journey from Munich to a small Bavarian town was plagued by cascading failures: a series of delays, a cancelled connection, and a replacement bus that failed to materialize. The climax occurs when the author is placed on a train heading in the wrong direction, eventually ending up 60km from their destination in a different town. The author highlights the lack of communication from DB staff, the inability to get off at an intermediate stop due to "bureaucratic" rules, and the overall feeling of being helpless and "kidnapped" by the system. The piece serves as a critique of the declining reliability and customer service of Deutsche Bahn.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on a widespread frustration with the state of European rail, particularly Deutsche Bahn (DB), and a debate over whether such failures are systemic or isolated incidents. Many commenters shared similar negative experiences with DB, describing chronic delays, poor communication, and a general sense of decay. This sentiment was extended to other national railways, with users arguing over whether the UK, France, or Italy were better or worse. A recurring theme was the comparison to the UK, where some praised the "Delay Repay" compensation system and good local service, while others condemned its exorbitant prices and frequent cancellations.

A significant point of contention was the severity of the problem. Some commenters, particularly those with experience in the US, defended DB as being relatively functional compared to other options and argued that Germans have an overly low tolerance for inconvenience. However, others pushed back, stating that these issues are not normal and are indicative of a deeper lack of investment and redundancy in the German system. The discussion also touched on the passenger experience for non-German speakers, the lack of staff flexibility in crises, and a call for airline-style financial compensation for delays to incentivize better performance.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 501 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that HTML5 is lenient and allows developers to use non-standard, custom tags (e.g., `<main-article>`, `<my-widget>`) directly in markup. These unknown tags are rendered as inline elements by default (similar to a `<span>`) and can be fully styled with CSS. The author presents this as a simple, "secret" feature of HTML that can make markup more readable and semantic for specific projects without requiring immediate JavaScript or complex setup.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but quickly pivots to the distinction between "bare" custom tags and formal Web Components. While many commenters confirm that unknown tags behave like `<span>`s and are useful for readability, the consensus is that this is just the starting point.

The conversation highlights several key themes:
*   **Web Components are the "Pro" version:** Many users immediately pointed to the Custom Elements API (part of Web Components) as the robust way to implement this. Libraries like **Lit** are recommended for adding functionality (state, lifecycle, event handling) to these tags, offering a lightweight alternative to heavy frameworks like React.
*   **Semantic HTML vs. "Div Soup":** A debate emerged regarding the article's examples. Several users argued that using custom tags like `<article-header>` is often unnecessary "div soup" and that standard HTML5 tags (like `<article>`, `<header>`, `<blockquote>`) are usually the better choice for accessibility and semantics.
*   **Framework Fatigue:** There is a recurring sentiment of frustration with the modern React-dominated ecosystem. Commenters expressed appreciation for Web Components as a way to build complex UIs using native browser features without the overhead of Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks.
*   **Technical Nuances:** Users noted specific technical details, such as how the browser distinguishes between unknown tags and valid custom element names (hyphenated tags get `HTMLElement` prototypes, ensuring future-proofing) and the existence of pure CSS solutions for conditional visibility (e.g., `@media (scripting)`).

## [Show HN: Z80-μLM, a 'Conversational AI' That Fits in 40KB](https://github.com/HarryR/z80ai)
**Score:** 428 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46417815

> **Project:** The project, Z80-μLM, is a "conversational AI" model designed to run on the Z80 microprocessor architecture, fitting entirely within a 40KB executable file (.com). It is a "Small Language Model" (SLM) that uses a simplified neural network architecture (a single linear layer with 128 hidden units) and a small vocabulary to generate responses. The project includes the source code, a pre-trained model, and an emulator, aiming to demonstrate that rudimentary AI capabilities can exist on extremely constrained, retro hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with enthusiasm, primarily marveling at the technical achievement of fitting a language model into such a tiny footprint. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Nostalgia and Retro Computing:** Many commenters were delighted by the prospect of running AI on classic hardware like the Gameboy or their own homebrew Z80 computers. There was a shared sense of wonder at how "magical" this would have seemed in the 1980s.
*   **Practical Applications and Demos:** A top request was for a Z80 simulator or emulator setup to allow people to easily play with the model without needing physical hardware.
*   **AI Security and Interpretability:** One user posed a theoretical question about whether a secret (like a passphrase) could be securely embedded in such a small model's weights. This sparked a brief but interesting sub-thread about the feasibility of "undetectable backdoors" and the field of model interpretability.
*   **Serendipity and Coincidence:** Several users noted the project's perfect timing for their own niche projects, such as building Z80 computers or creating virtual environments with CP/M emulators, leading to a discussion about how interconnected the tech world can be.
*   **Humor and Perspective:** Commenters used humor to frame the project's scale, contrasting it with massive modern LLMs by calling it an "SLM" and joking about its potential for solving the "ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything."

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 344 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red, the parent company of the GOG.com digital game store, is selling GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The official rationale is strategic: CD Projekt wants to focus entirely on developing high-quality RPGs and entertainment based on its intellectual properties (like The Witcher and Cyberpunk). This move allows GOG to gain a dedicated owner who can invest in its unique mission. GOG's leadership states the store is financially stable and that this acquisition will provide stronger backing to pursue its core values of DRM-free gaming, game preservation, and user control.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction is largely positive, viewing the acquisition as a win for game preservation and ethical business practices. Many commenters express strong support for GOG's mission, highlighting that its DRM-free policy gives users genuine ownership of their games, a stark contrast to the "leasing" model they associate with platforms like Steam. The move is seen as a way to protect GOG from being a potential cost-cutting casualty if CD Projekt's larger game development projects were to face financial difficulties.

However, there is a notable undercurrent of skepticism regarding GOG's financial health. One commenter argues that the optimistic language used in the official announcement ("encouraging year") is often corporate euphemism for a company in trouble. This view is countered by others who point to GOG's reported stability and growing enthusiasm for its mission.

Practical concerns about the platform's user experience also surfaced. A recurring point is the lack of an official Linux client, with some users wishing GOG would support third-party launchers like Heroic Games Launcher. Finally, some commenters reflected on the broader industry trend of publishers creating their own launchers, making CD Projekt's decision to divest from its storefront a noteworthy and, to some, a welcome, anomaly.

## [As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/28/nx-s1-5656190/ai-chips-memory-prices-ram)
**Score:** 298 | **Comments:** 451 | **ID:** 46415338

> **Article:** An NPR article reports that the surge in demand for AI hardware, particularly for memory-intensive GPUs used in data centers, is causing a shortage and price increase for memory chips (RAM). This is expected to raise the cost of consumer electronics like PCs and smartphones. The article notes that while new manufacturing capacity is being built, it won't be online for several years, meaning high prices are likely to persist. It also highlights that large companies like Apple often secure long-term pricing, insulating them from short-term market volatility, while smaller consumers and businesses will feel the pinch first.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely pessimistic and cynical about the price increases. Many commenters feel the "may rise" framing is already outdated, asserting that prices are already "through the roof." There is a strong sense of frustration, with some users viewing the situation as a "racket" or a "mafia" scheme orchestrated by AI companies and manufacturers to milk consumers for more money. Skepticism is directed at the effectiveness of government intervention, with one user wryly noting that officials have little incentive to stop a profitable trend.

The conversation explores several key themes:
*   **Corporate vs. Consumer Impact:** Users point out that large corporations like Apple can weather the storm through long-term supply contracts, while smaller businesses and individuals will be priced out. This is seen as exacerbating the power imbalance between big tech and everyone else.
*   **The Future of Software and Hardware:** A debate emerges on how the industry will adapt. One perspective is that this will force a return to software efficiency, as developers will need to optimize for stagnating consumer hardware. The counter-argument is that this will accelerate the shift to centralized cloud services, where economies of scale make powerful compute cheaper, but at the cost of user autonomy and increasing reliance on low-latency connections.
*   **Consumer Experience and Market Regression:** Commenters note a worrying trend of budget devices shipping with lower specs (e.g., 8GB RAM) at higher prices, while features previously common in mid-range products are being moved to premium tiers. This is seen as a regression in personal computing that disproportionately harms students and researchers.
*   **Cynicism and Coping Mechanisms:** The discussion is peppered with dark humor (e.g., Soviet jokes about vodka prices) and a sense of resignation. Practical advice is offered, such as disabling JavaScript to avoid ads and sensationalism, with some users noting they feel no need to upgrade their decade-old hardware for their daily tasks.

## [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
**Score:** 272 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46414723

> **Article:** The article "Software engineers should be a little bit cynical" by Sean Goedecke argues that software engineers should adopt a pragmatic, "clear-eyed cynicism" to navigate corporate structures effectively. Goedecke contrasts this with both naive idealism (believing companies are purely benevolent) and "toxic cynicism" (believing companies are purely evil and that one's work is meaningless).

He posits that while companies are ultimately driven by profit and shareholder value, they *do* want to build good software because that is how they achieve their goals. The author advises engineers to accept that they are cogs in a machine and won't set company direction, but to focus their influence on the technical execution. By understanding the cynical reality of corporate motivations but choosing to act professionally and idealistically within their sphere of control, engineers can maintain agency, do good work, and avoid burnout.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after ten years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 270 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, a popular mocking framework for Java, after ten years. He cites burnout and an "energy drain" as the primary reasons. A key catalyst for his decision was the effort required to adapt Mockito to upcoming changes in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Specifically, JVM 22 introduced restrictions on "dynamic attachment of agents," a mechanism Mockito relied on, forcing a significant and difficult architectural change (making Mockito's main artifact an agent itself). Dutheil also expressed frustration with the communication from the JVM development team, which he perceived as dismissive of his project's needs, and noted the ongoing challenges of supporting Kotlin, which has complex implementation details that complicate the framework.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes. A central point was the technical conflict between Mockito's needs and the JVM's evolution. The change related to JEP 451 (disallowing dynamic agent loading) was explained, with some users expressing concern that such "by default" security and integrity changes create significant friction for maintainers and could lead to enterprises avoiding new JVM versions. A representative from the JDK team ("pron") defended the change, framing it as a necessary step for platform integrity, security, and performance, and noted they had worked with the ByteBuddy author to find a solution.

A second major theme was the broader debate on the value of mocking libraries. Many commenters argued that mocking is overused, leads to brittle tests, and is often a symptom of poor software design. They advocated for using real implementations or fakes instead. However, others defended mocking as a pragmatic necessity for dealing with large, legacy codebases that are not designed for testability.

Finally, there was a significant discussion about the human and open-source sustainability aspects. Many commenters expressed sympathy for the maintainer, acknowledging the thanklessness and burnout common in OSS. The debate over financial compensation was raised, with some arguing that monetization is essential for sustainability, while others contended that extrinsic motivation can be toxic to the passion that drives open source. The decision to support Kotlin was also questioned, with some suggesting a Kotlin-specific framework like MockK is a better fit.

## [Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should](https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46414819

> **Article:** The article "Unity's Mono problem" argues that Unity's C# performance is significantly hampered by its outdated runtime. Unity has long been stuck on a fork of the old Mono framework, which is far slower than modern .NET (CoreCLR). The author demonstrates this with benchmarks showing that a simple data processing task runs over 20 times faster when executed in a modern .NET environment compared to Unity's Mono. The piece also notes that Unity's use of the inferior Boehm garbage collector, instead of Mono's more advanced SGen, exacerbates performance and memory fragmentation issues. The author concludes that Unity's long-delayed migration to CoreCLR is critical for developers to access modern C# performance and language features.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, focusing on Unity's development history, the practical impact of the runtime, and alternative technologies. A major theme is the historical context of Unity's performance issues. Several commenters argue that Unity is largely to blame for its own technical debt, having been slow to update its Mono version for years due to licensing disputes and then deflecting blame onto the open-source Mono project. Now that modern .NET is free and open-source, Unity's slow progress on the CoreCLR migration is seen as a failure of technical execution.

A second key theme is the real-world impact on developers. Commenters point out that the problem isn't just raw execution speed; the current Boehm GC causes memory fragmentation and "leaks," and the slow C# runtime leads to frustratingly long domain reloads in the editor. However, some experienced developers counter that the article's focus is slightly misplaced. They argue that most performance-critical Unity games ship with IL2CPP, not Mono, and that Unity's intended path for high performance is its proprietary Burst compiler and HPC# system, not raw C#.

Finally, there's a broader debate about Unity's architecture. Some commenters express frustration with Unity's "special sauce" solutions like IL2CPP and Burst, arguing they are complex, proprietary, and often underperform compared to modern .NET or well-written C++. This leads to recommendations for alternative engines like Stride (which is already on .NET 10) or Godot, which use modern .NET runtimes out of the box. The consensus is that while the move to CoreCLR is welcome, it's arriving late and highlights deeper issues with Unity's technical strategy.

## [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
**Score:** 241 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46414475

> **Article:** The article "MongoBleed Explained Simply" describes a security vulnerability in MongoDB, designated CVE-2024-5689. The core issue is an uninitialized memory leak. When a MongoDB server allocates memory to handle a request, it fails to clear this memory before use. If the memory was previously used for sensitive data (like authentication keys or user information), that data can be included in the server's response to the client, effectively leaking it.

The vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can be exploited without authentication, allowing any remote attacker to potentially retrieve sensitive data from the server. The article also touches on the timeline of the vulnerability's discovery and disclosure, noting that while the public fix was committed on December 19th, MongoDB stated their Atlas cloud clusters were patched days earlier. It concludes by suggesting that using memory-safe languages or employing memory allocation techniques that overwrite freed memory (like some custom allocators) could prevent such bugs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes: the root cause of the bug, the operational security of MongoDB deployments, and the broader context of software development practices.

A primary theme was the prevalence of misconfigured, internet-exposed MongoDB instances. Commenters noted that Shodan shows over 200,000 such instances, linking this to a developer culture that prioritizes ease-of-use (like avoiding schema design) over proper security measures, such as setting up internal networks.

The technical cause of the bug—using an unsafe language like C++—sparked a debate on mitigation. One commenter shared that their company's custom memory allocator overwrites freed memory with a static pattern to prevent data leaks, a practice they found had no measurable performance impact. However, another user countered that compiler optimizations could potentially eliminate such writes, rendering the mitigation ineffective in some cases.

Finally, the discussion included corrections and clarifications about the article itself. Several users pointed out inaccuracies in the author's timeline, explaining that MongoDB uses a private internal repository and syncs changes to the public one, which accounts for the date discrepancies. Other comments clarified that MongoDB Atlas customers were patched before the public disclosure and that the vulnerability was mitigated automatically.

## [CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them? (2021)](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2023/05/ceos-salaries-expensive-automate-robots)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 288 | **ID:** 46415488

> **Article:** The article, from May 2023, argues that the role of the CEO is ripe for automation by AI. It posits that with the rise of large language models capable of processing vast amounts of data to inform strategic decisions, the exorbitant salaries commanded by human CEOs are becoming unjustifiable. The author suggests that an AI could perform the analytical functions of the job more efficiently and at a fraction of the cost, effectively replacing a key human role with technology, just as many other jobs are being threatened by automation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on automating CEOs is multifaceted, with commenters approaching the idea from legal, practical, and cynical perspectives.

A significant portion of the debate centered on the practical and social nature of the CEO role. Many argued that the job is fundamentally about "soft skills" that are difficult, if not impossible, to automate: networking, building relationships, selling a vision, and providing human leadership. One commenter quipped that the real question is about automating "soft skills" in general, while another humorously suggested that being a CEO is less automatable than being a sex worker due to its reliance on social finesse without a physical component. However, a counterpoint was raised that much of this work could be reduced to writing emails and that an AI could generate strategic plans and communications just as effectively.

The legal and accountability hurdles were a major theme. A key argument was that CEOs have legal and fiduciary duties that cannot be delegated to a machine. Commenters clarified that under Delaware law, where most US public companies are incorporated, directors' duties are "non-delegable" and must be performed by a "natural person." This creates a significant legal barrier, as any company using an AI CEO would need to assign legal liability for its actions to the approving human executives or the AI vendor, a risk most vendors would refuse to accept.

Finally, the discussion was colored by cynicism and broader critiques of corporate leadership. Some argued that the primary obstacle is that the people who would implement such automation (the board and existing executives) are the ones who would lose the surplus value that CEO salaries represent. Others viewed the idea of an AI CEO as potentially "psychopathic" and even more ruthless in its treatment of the workforce. A highly upvoted comment accused many modern CEOs of hypocrisy—using the threat of AI to suppress wages for others while protecting their own "exclusive club" through networking and PR, suggesting the debate is less about technological feasibility and more about power and duplicity.

## [Show HN: Vibe coding a bookshelf with Claude Code](https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46420453

> **Project:** The project is a "vibe-coded" web application that creates a visual bookshelf. The author used Claude Code, an AI-assisted coding tool, to build the entire project. The result is a visually appealing, interactive webpage that allows a user to manage and display a personal collection of books. The project serves as a demonstration of using modern AI tools to rapidly build a polished, personal software project without deep, manual coding.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community responded positively, with the discussion centering on the nature and future of "vibe coding"—using AI to generate software based on high-level intent.

Commenters broadly agreed that this project is an ideal use case for current AI tools: small, personal, single-user applications that don't require complex dependencies or large-scale architecture. A key theme was the distinction between simple "vibe coding" and using AI for larger projects. While some argued that AI tools struggle with large codebases and tend to over-engineer solutions, others countered that with proper architectural guidance and context management, AI can be a powerful assistant for more complex development.

The conversation also touched on the evolving role of the human developer. Many felt that "taste" and the ability to articulate intent would remain key human contributions, though some debated whether this would be a lasting advantage. The project also evoked nostalgia for older, beloved applications like Delicious Library, with several users reminiscing about the joy of organizing digital collections. Overall, the project was praised as a practical and inspiring example of how AI can empower individuals to create useful, aesthetically pleasing software for themselves.

## [Staying ahead of censors in 2025](https://forum.torproject.org/t/staying-ahead-of-censors-in-2025-what-weve-learned-from-fighting-censorship-in-iran-and-russia/20898)
**Score:** 218 | **Comments:** 256 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** The article from the Tor Project forum, "Staying ahead of censors in 2025," details the evolution of censorship-circumvention techniques in response to advanced Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) used by state-level censors in countries like Iran and Russia. The core argument is that simple obfuscation (making traffic look random) is no longer effective, as this randomness itself has become a signature. The new paradigm is "mimicry," where Tor traffic is designed to be indistinguishable from legitimate, uncensored traffic. The article highlights two key technologies:
1.  **WebTunnel:** A bridge that mimics a standard HTTPS server, hiding Tor traffic within legitimate-looking web traffic.
2.  **Conjure:** A system that leverages unused IP address space at the ISP level. Censors cannot block these IP ranges without risking collateral damage by blocking future legitimate services, creating a significant dilemma for them.
The article frames this as a continuous cat-and-mouse game, emphasizing that the future of censorship resistance lies in forcing censors into making difficult choices that could break the internet for their own citizens.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion, while acknowledging the technical advancements, primarily revolves around three themes: the broader political and legal context of censorship, specific technical curiosities, and the conspicuous omission of certain geopolitical actors.

A significant portion of the debate centers on legal and ethical questions. One user, facing their own business dilemma with sanctions, asks if Tor needs an OFAC license to operate in sanctioned countries like Iran and Russia. This sparks a sub-thread on whether distributing free software constitutes "trade" under US law, with most commenters concluding it is an act of speech, not commerce, and thus not subject to trade restrictions.

Many commenters express frustration that the article's focus on Iran and Russia ignores censorship in Western democracies. They point to the UK's rising arrests for "offensive" online communications, Australia's age-verification laws, and the EU's "chat control" proposals as forms of censorship that Tor should also be technically addressing. This leads to speculation that Tor's significant US government funding prevents it from publicly criticizing its allies in the same way it does its adversaries. The complete absence of China from the article is also noted, with users assuming it's due to a lack of resources or an insurmountable technical challenge.

On the technical front, there is keen interest in the "Conjure" system, with users marveling at the non-technical feat of convincing ISPs to cooperate. However, some are skeptical that major Russian or other unsympathetic ISPs would ever participate. Other technical discussions include users sharing the latest proxy tools used to bypass the Great Firewall of China (e.g., V2Ray, Trojan) and requests for improved user experience, such as a simple GUI for changing exit nodes and native DNS tunneling support in Tor.

## [Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain collapses as partner writes down deal by 99%](https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/)
**Score:** 217 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46423290

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that L&F, a key partner in Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain, has written down its contract with Tesla by 99.999%. The value of the deal has been reduced from an expected $2.9 billion to just $7,386. This massive write-down indicates a near-total collapse of the supply agreement, suggesting that Tesla's production and demand for the 4680 cells, particularly for the Cybertruck, have fallen far short of initial projections.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is highly skeptical of Tesla's current trajectory and valuation, with commenters pointing to a growing list of negative indicators. The central theme is the disconnect between Tesla's stock performance and its reported business fundamentals, such as declining sales in the US, Europe, and China, and the failure of key technological initiatives like the 4680 battery.

A prominent theory is that Tesla's stock price is detached from reality and functions more like a speculative asset or a "call option on Elon Musk's success." Some users suggest this is sustained by questionable financial engineering, specifically pointing to other Musk-led companies like SpaceX purchasing large volumes of unsold Tesla Cybertrucks to artificially inflate revenue.

While some commenters express skepticism towards the source (Electrek) and suggest the battery program might simply be "rejigging suppliers," the prevailing sentiment is one of concern. The 99.999% write-down is seen as a catastrophic indicator for the 4680 program. The discussion also broadens to critique the wider EV market, with one user noting that the market's heavy bet on Tesla has led to a grim outlook for electrification as other companies scale back their EV ambitions.

**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 12 | **ID:** 46413975

> **Article:** PySDR is a free online guide titled "A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python" that teaches Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) concepts through practical Python examples. It is designed to be an accessible, engineering-oriented resource for beginners and professionals alike, bridging the gap between theoretical math and real-world implementation. The guide covers the fundamentals of radio, Fourier transforms, filtering, and synchronization, using Python code to demonstrate how signals are processed.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community received the resource with overwhelming positivity. Users ranging from beginners to DSP experts praised it for its practical, engineering-focused approach and clear explanations, making it a go-to reference for re-learning basics or onboarding new team members. The consensus is that the hardware required for the tutorials (like the cheap RTL-SDR) is affordable and a worthwhile investment.

However, a nuanced critique emerged regarding the material's depth. Some users noted that the guide can be "hand-wavy" on specific implementation details, such as how to choose certain loop parameters for signal locking. While one commenter suggested using an LLM as a "personal graduate-level TA" to fill these theoretical gaps, another user requested more direct references to less abstract material. Overall, the discussion highlighted the guide's strength as a practical starting point, acknowledging that mastering the underlying theory often requires supplementary resources.

## [Researchers discover molecular difference in autistic brains](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/molecular-difference-in-autistic-brains/)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46415129

> **Article:** Researchers from Yale University have published a study in *The American Journal of Psychiatry* identifying a molecular difference in the brains of autistic individuals. Using a new technique combining EEG and PET scans, they found that autistic brains have fewer receptors for glutamate, the brain's most common excitatory neurotransmitter, specifically the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGlu5). The study involved 16 autistic adults and 16 neurotypical controls. The researchers suggest this reduced receptor availability could be linked to characteristics of autism, such as social difficulties and repetitive behaviors. However, they emphasize that it is unclear whether this difference is a root cause of autism or a consequence of the brain developing and living with the condition. The discovery of an EEG biomarker could potentially lead to more cost-effective screening and a more objective understanding of autism.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was highly critical of the study's methodology and the media's portrayal of its findings. A primary concern was the study's very small sample size (16 subjects per group), with many commenters arguing that such a small number makes the results highly susceptible to random chance and unlikely to be reproducible. Several users pointed out significant design flaws, most notably a demographic mismatch where the autistic group was 100% White while the control group was only 37.5% White, a discrepancy that could easily skew the results.

Beyond the methodology, there was significant skepticism about the implications of the research. Many commenters warned against the simplistic idea of "treating" autism by supplementing glutamate, explaining that brain chemistry is complex and such an intervention could have perverse, negative consequences. The discussion also highlighted the fundamental challenge of studying "autism" as a single, monolithic condition. Commenters argued that the autism spectrum is incredibly broad and heterogeneous, and that averaging results across such a diverse group may obscure more than it reveals. Some pointed to emerging research that attempts to classify autism into distinct phenotypes, suggesting that future research must be more specific to be meaningful.

Finally, there was a philosophical debate about the nature of autism itself. Some users challenged the clinical definition that autism must be a "hindrance," while others debated whether the observed receptor difference should be viewed as a "deficit" to be corrected or simply a variation in brain wiring, perhaps even one with potential advantages. The overall sentiment was that while the research technique is interesting, the current findings are preliminary, overhyped, and require significant replication and more nuanced investigation.

## [Rich Hickey: Thanks AI](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/ea94e3741ff0a4e3af55b9fe6287887f)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46415945

> **Article:** The linked content is a short, sarcastic note from renowned software engineer Rich Hickey, author of Clojure. Addressed to "AI", the note "thanks" it for making him realize the value of his own work. He sarcastically lists things AI has helped him understand, such as the importance of "hammock time" (deep thought), the fact that code is a liability, and that "slop" (low-quality, mass-produced content/code) is not a valuable commodity. The core message is a critique of the current AI hype cycle, arguing that it promotes thoughtless, rapid generation of low-quality output, thereby highlighting the enduring value of careful, deliberate, and thoughtful software design.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the validity of Hickey's critique and the broader ethics and impact of generative AI. Many commenters, particularly senior developers, expressed agreement with Hickey, viewing the AI-driven push for quantity over quality as a "strange new world" and a departure from thoughtful engineering. A significant portion of the debate focused on the "AI slop" phenomenon, with some users coining terms like "slopbaiting" to describe what they see as a flood of low-value, AI-generated content.

However, a strong counter-argument emerged, suggesting that AI coding tools are highly effective for automating repetitive work, implying that those who find AI's output to be "slop" may be working on problems that are already solved or are not leveraging the tools correctly. The discussion also delved into the ethics of AI, with some users accusing Hickey and other critics of cynical "bandwagoning" given their past involvement in industries with their own societal drawbacks. Others pointed out the irony of AI models generating saccharine "thank you" notes to the very creators whose work they were trained on without compensation, viewing it as a glib attempt to solve an image problem. The conversation concluded with a philosophical debate on responsibility, questioning whether to blame the tools or the corporate and regulatory systems that incentivize their use.

## [Show HN: My not-for-profit search engine with no ads, no AI, & all DDG bangs](https://nilch.org)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 66 | **ID:** 46417748

> **Project:** The project, "nilch," is a new, not-for-profit search engine frontend. It is designed to be simple and clean, with no ads or AI features. It functions as a wrapper around the Brave Search API and includes all of DuckDuckGo's "bangs" for quick redirection to other sites. The creator's stated goal is to provide a minimalist, privacy-respecting alternative in the search engine space, with a long-term aspiration to build its own index and ranking algorithm.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's response was a mix of praise for the project's ethos and constructive feedback on its technical and business model. The creator, UnmappedStack, was highly engaged in the discussion.

Key discussion points included:

*   **Technical Foundation & Future:** Several users pointed out that nilch is currently a "thin wrapper" over Brave Search, not a true search engine. While the creator acknowledged this and expressed a desire to build a custom index, commenters highlighted the immense difficulty and cost of doing so, suggesting alternatives like MarginaliaSearch's open-source index.

*   **Business Model & Sustainability:** A major theme was the project's financial viability. Users expressed concern that the creator would incur high costs from the Brave API and suggested partnerships (e.g., Ecosia) or donations. A broader debate emerged about profit in non-commercial software, with some arguing that sustainable profitability is essential for long-term survival and developer well-being, while others cautioned that ad-based profit models are inherently corrupting.

*   **Feature Requests & Bug Reports:** Users quickly identified missing features compared to DuckDuckGo, such as support for bangs in the middle of a query and a "bang-only" mode that immediately redirects. Several users reported a critical `JSON.parse` error, which the creator discovered was due to hitting the API's credit limit—a problem that was quickly resolved.

*   **The Open-Source Ranking Dilemma:** One commenter argued that an open-source ranking algorithm is a bad idea because it would give spammers a "recipe" to game the results. This sparked a counter-discussion about the need for user-selectable, transparent algorithms to combat the opaque ranking of centralized platforms.

*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** A user asked how nilch differs from SearxNG, another privacy-focused search aggregator. The creator responded that nilch prioritizes extreme simplicity and a minimal feature set.

## [Huge Binaries](https://fzakaria.com/2025/12/28/huge-binaries)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46417791

> **Article:** The article "Huge Binaries" by Farid Zakaria discusses the problem of extremely large binaries, citing examples from his experience at companies like Google where binaries can exceed 25GiB. The primary cause is not the executable code itself, but the inclusion of massive debug symbols. To support such large binaries, companies must use the "large" code model on 64-bit x86 systems, which disables PC-relative addressing and can negatively impact performance. The author explores the linker's solution of using "thunks" (small trampolines) to break up long-distance calls, allowing the use of the more efficient "small" code model even in very large binaries.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on whether such massive binaries are a necessary evil or a sign of a deeper architectural problem. A key point of consensus was that the 25GiB figure is almost certainly due to debug symbols, not the executable code. However, commenters were divided on the implications.

One camp argued that this is a self-inflicted problem indicative of poor engineering. They suggested that an executable code base large enough to require the large code model is a "code smell," and that companies should employ better dead code elimination (LTO, `--gc-sections`), break the application into smaller services, or use deployment artifacts like container images instead of a single monolithic binary. Several ex-Google employees shared anecdotes about the operational drag caused by this bloat, where infrastructure was scaled up to compensate for inefficiency rather than fixing the root cause.

The other camp defended the practice, particularly within the context of FAANG-scale engineering. They argued that the trade-offs, such as simplified deployment and potential performance gains, can be worth the cost. The discussion also delved into the technical details of the problem, with users pointing out that modern linkers and tools like Facebook's BOLT are designed to mitigate these issues by optimizing code layout and managing call distances with thunks, thus avoiding the performance penalty of the large code model.

## [You can't design software you don't work on](https://www.seangoedecke.com/you-cant-design-software-you-dont-work-on/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46418415

> **Article:** The article argues that you cannot effectively design software for a system you are not actively working on. The author, Sean Goedecke, contrasts software engineering with structural engineering, where architects can design a building without laying bricks. In software, he claims, the "map is not the territory"—the reality of the codebase, its constraints, and its history are so complex that only those immersed in it can make sound design decisions. He posits that "generic" design advice (like "favor composition over inheritance") is often useless when applied to specific, complex problems in existing large systems. The only way to make meaningful architectural changes is to be a developer who writes the code, understands the existing system intimately, and iterates on the design through implementation.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely validates the article's premise but explores nuances and edge cases. The consensus leans toward agreeing with the author, particularly regarding the difficulty of designing for complex, existing systems.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **The Map vs. The Territory:** Several commenters echoed the article's core idea, citing Naur's "Theory of Programming" (where the system's true knowledge resides in the developers' heads) and the "tree swing cartoon" (illustrating how requirements are lost in translation between management and implementers). The general agreement is that abstract, high-level plans often fail to capture the messy reality of the codebase.

*   **The Amazon "Free Sample" Example:** The author's detailed example of designing a feature for an online retailer was a major point of discussion. Some argued this proved the point—no one could predict all those edge cases upfront. However, a counter-argument emerged that a well-factored system, built on good engineering principles (like separating policy from mechanism), could handle this complexity. This led to the crucial caveat: the article's advice applies most strongly to *legacy* or poorly-structured systems, where the "ground" is already unstable.

*   **Experience vs. Generic Advice:** A minority view argued that an experienced architect who has built many similar systems *can* design effectively without being deep in the code. This was countered by the distinction that this works for *new* projects but fails when adding features to an existing, complex system where the design must be contingent on the current implementation.

*   **Consistency and "Art vs. Engineering":** A sub-thread debated the value of consistency. While the article suggests consistency is more important than "good design" in large codebases, some commenters pushed back, arguing that "consistently bad" practices are still bad. This tied into a broader debate on whether software is a true engineering discipline with established best practices or a creative art form that resists generic rules.

*   **Tautology and Irony:** A few wry comments noted that the article itself is a piece of generic advice, creating a tautological loop. Others pointed out the irony of a non-programming manager trying to design software, which is the exact scenario the article warns against.
