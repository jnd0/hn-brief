## [What an unprocessed photo looks like](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/)
**Score:** 1622 | **Comments:** 273 | **ID:** 46415225

> **Article:** The article "What an unprocessed photo looks like" demystifies the digital photography pipeline by showing the stages of image creation from raw sensor data to a final image. It explains that a camera sensor itself doesn't capture color, only light intensity. To create a color image, a Bayer filter (a grid of Red, Green, and Blue filters) is placed over the sensor, meaning each pixel only records one color. This raw data, which appears as a "greenish, dark, and low-contrast" image, must undergo significant processing. Key steps include demosaicing (interpolating the missing two color values for each pixel), applying a gamma curve to correct for the sensor's linear response and make the image appear correctly on a monitor, and performing white balance and color adjustments. The article uses a single example with challenging mixed lighting to illustrate that the "ground truth" is not a single objective image, but rather an interpretation of the sensor's data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely praised the article for its clear and accessible explanation of the complex, hidden processes behind every digital photograph. A central theme was the philosophical debate over what constitutes a "real" or "fake" photo. Many commenters argued that since every photo, even one straight from a camera, is a heavily processed and interpreted version of reality, the concept of "fake" is misleading. They contended that intent to deceive is the only true measure of a fake image, not the application of edits or filters.

Technically, the discussion delved deeper into the "why" behind the processes. Users explained that gamma correction is not just a monitor limitation but also a psycho-visual tool to allocate more data bits to the shadows and highlights where human eyes are more sensitive. The importance of the Bayer filter's green channel for capturing luminance (detail) was highlighted, linking it to the principles of chroma subsampling in video.

Finally, the conversation touched upon the future of image processing with AI. While some expressed concern about AI "hallucinating" details and blurring the line of authenticity, others pointed out that machine learning algorithms for demosaicing have been the state-of-the-art for years, making AI an integral, if invisible, part of modern photography long before the recent hype.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that modern browsers will render any non-standard HTML tag (e.g., `<my-custom-tag>`) without errors. By default, these unknown elements behave like inline `<span>` elements, allowing them to be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript just like standard elements. The author presents this as a simple, built-in feature of HTML that can be used to create more descriptive, semantic markup for specific projects without needing complex frameworks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but quickly pivots to the more robust and standardized solution: **Web Components** and the **Custom Elements API**.

Key points from the discussion include:
*   **Technical Nuance:** Commenters clarified that the browser's handling of these tags depends on the name format. Tags containing a hyphen (e.g., `<my-tag>`) are treated as `HTMLElement` objects, while those without a hyphen become `HTMLUnknownElement`.
*   **Web Components are the Real Solution:** Many users pointed out that while "making up tags" works for styling, the Custom Elements API is the proper way to give them actual functionality (e.g., a `<my-code>` tag that automatically adds a copy button). Libraries like **Lit** were mentioned as excellent tools for this.
*   **Framework Debate:** A recurring theme was a preference for this native web technology over large JavaScript frameworks like React. Several developers expressed frustration with the trend of building entire SPAs for simple sites, arguing that a "HTML-first" approach with custom elements is often better for users and simpler for developers.
*   **Critique of the Article's Example:** Some commenters criticized the article's specific example (`<main-article>`, `<article-header>`) as "div soup," arguing that standard semantic HTML tags (`<article>`, `<header>`) were the correct choice and that custom tags are better suited for components that don't have a native equivalent.
*   **Practical Use Cases:** Users shared examples of using this technique, such as creating a `<yes-script>` tag (the opposite of `<noscript>`) and using it for personal projects where a full framework would be overkill.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after ten years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 171 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, the most popular mocking framework for Java, after ten years of contributions. He cites burnout and a significant "energy drain" as the primary reasons. A key factor was the recent challenge of adapting Mockito to JVM changes (specifically JEP 451), which restricted dynamic agent attachment. This required a major architectural shift in Mockito 5, causing significant maintenance overhead. Dutheil also mentions the complexities introduced by supporting Kotlin and the general lack of support from the broader JVM ecosystem, referencing the classic "XKCD 2347" comic about open source dependency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the nature of the burnout, the technical conflict with the JVM, and the validity of mocking itself.

Many commenters expressed sympathy for the maintainer, acknowledging the thanklessness of long-term open source work and the burnout that often results. There was a debate on whether financial compensation would have solved the issue, with some arguing it provides necessary motivation, while others contending that extrinsic rewards can be toxic to the passion required for such projects.

Technically, the conversation focused on the JVM's "Integrity by Default" policy. Some users, including a JDK maintainer ("pron"), defended the change as necessary for security and platform stability, explaining that it requires explicit user consent (via flags) to load agents. Others argued that this "by-default" approach inconveniences the vast majority of users to solve a security concern, potentially holding back enterprise adoption of newer Java versions and forcing maintainers of critical libraries to do difficult re-architecting work.

Finally, a significant sub-thread debated the merits of mocking frameworks in general. Several developers argued that mocking is an "anti-pattern" or a "code smell" indicating poor application design, and that using real implementations or fakes is superior. However, others defended mocking as a pragmatic necessity for testing large, legacy codebases that were not designed with testability in mind. The discussion also touched on the friction between Java and Kotlin ecosystems, with some suggesting Kotlin users should use Kotlin-specific tools like MockK.

## [CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them? (2021)](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2023/05/ceos-salaries-expensive-automate-robots)
**Score:** 216 | **Comments:** 254 | **ID:** 46415488

> **Article:** The article, from May 2023, provocatively argues that the exorbitant salaries of CEOs could be eliminated by automating the role with AI. It suggests that an AI could perform the core functions of a CEO—analyzing vast amounts of data to make strategic decisions—more effectively and at a fraction of the cost. The author posits that since many executive decisions are based on data analysis, an AI could outperform human executives, who are often driven by emotion and ego, and whose success can be as much about luck as skill. The piece frames this as a logical step towards efficiency and a solution to the perceived problem of excessive executive compensation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely dismisses the article's premise as simplistic, arguing that the role of a CEO is far more complex and human-centric than the article suggests. The key points of contention revolve around three main themes: the nature of the CEO's job, the legal and practical barriers to automation, and the economic implications.

First, many commenters assert that a CEO's primary function is not data analysis but "soft skills" and human relationships. Their job is defined by selling a vision, networking, negotiating, managing the board, and providing leadership—tasks that are fundamentally social and relational, making them extremely difficult to automate. One user sarcastically noted that if the job were just writing emails and strategies, one could simply ask ChatGPT to do it and save millions, highlighting the perceived simplicity of the article's view.

Second, there are significant legal and practical hurdles. Under U.S. law, fiduciary duties are typically held by the board of directors (who must be natural persons) and cannot be legally delegated to an algorithm. Furthermore, any AI vendor providing such a service would likely refuse to take legal responsibility for the AI's decisions, creating a major contractual roadblock.

Finally, some commenters explored the economic paradox of automation. One user argued that if a CEO role were automated, the entity providing the AI would simply extract the surplus value that previously went to the human CEO, rather than it benefiting shareholders. Others pointed out the potential dystopian outcome of an AI CEO being even more "ruthless" and efficient in cost-cutting than a human, and debated whether an AI could truly replicate the "psychopathic" traits sometimes associated with successful leaders.

## [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46414723

> **Article:** The article "Software engineers should be a little bit cynical" by Sean Goedecke argues that software engineers should adopt a pragmatic, "cynical" worldview to navigate corporate realities without becoming disillusioned or ineffective. Goedecke defines this "healthy cynicism" not as nihilism, but as a realistic understanding that companies are primarily driven by profit and politics, not by a mission to create good software or change the world.

He contrasts this with "idealism," which he sees as a naive belief that companies care about engineering quality or user experience for their own sake. However, he argues that cynicism shouldn't lead to inaction or burnout. Instead, it should be the foundation for effective action. By understanding the true motivations of the business, engineers can better influence decisions, protect their own time, and find satisfaction in their work by focusing on what they can control—like writing good code and helping their immediate team—rather than trying to fix the entire company. Ultimately, he posits that a cynical mindset allows engineers to be more effective and happier by aligning their expectations with reality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's core premise, with many commenters sharing personal anecdotes of how a realistic, if cynical, perspective has protected them from emotional burnout. The general consensus is that understanding corporate self-interest is a crucial survival skill.

However, the conversation quickly moves beyond simple agreement to explore nuances and disagreements. A key point of contention is the nature of executive leadership. The author claims that C-level executives generally want to deliver good software, but many commenters strongly disagree, arguing that their primary, and often sole, motivation is increasing shareholder value. Some shared anecdotes of executives being "super-powerful young children" who need to be placated with "play-pretend" tactics, while others noted that startup CEOs often lie or are self-deluded to make sales. A specific counterexample was raised regarding the "High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation," suggesting that large-scale, anti-labor conspiracies do, in fact, occur.

Another major theme was the debate over the utility of cynicism versus idealism. While the article frames cynicism as a necessary base for effective action, some commenters argued that pure cynicism can be self-defeating. One user countered that "Cynics feel smart but optimists win," suggesting that a degree of optimism (or naivete) is necessary to achieve unlikely outcomes.

Finally, the discussion branched into alternative career strategies. One commenter argued that the article's advice is a "great guide on how to win soccer while hopping on one leg," and that the better solution is to change one's position entirely—by becoming a consultant or finding a near-perfect company—rather than trying to survive within a flawed system. Others debated the very definition of a "software engineer," with one user provocatively claiming the work is more akin to writing than engineering.

## [Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should](https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46414819

> **Article:** The article "Unity's Mono problem" argues that Unity's C# code runs significantly slower than it should because the engine is still tied to an old, outdated version of the Mono runtime. The author demonstrates with benchmarks that modern .NET (CoreCLR) is substantially faster than the Mono version used by Unity. The piece provides a brief history of why Unity initially chose Mono and why it has been slow to migrate to modern .NET, attributing the delay to technical debt and the immense difficulty of the porting effort. The article concludes that this performance gap is a major, unresolved issue for Unity developers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but adds significant nuance and historical context. A key theme is the slow pace of Unity's migration to CoreCLR. While some users point to official roadmaps indicating a CoreCLR-based player is scheduled for 2026, others express skepticism, suggesting Unity may lack the technical resources to complete the complex transition. This led to suggestions for alternative engines like Stride or Godot, though other commenters countered that these lack the feature set and ecosystem of Unity.

Several technical points were raised about the article's methodology. Some questioned the validity of benchmarking debug builds, though others defended the practice for C# and noted that performance gains in debug mode are still valuable for developer workflow. The discussion also highlighted that the performance problem is worse than just the runtime, pointing to Unity's use of the inferior Boehm garbage collector instead of Mono's more modern SGen GC, and the overhead introduced by IL2CPP.

Finally, the conversation provided deep historical context, with multiple users accusing Unity of mismanagement and deflecting blame. They argue that for years, Unity used an outdated Mono version and publicly blamed licensing issues with the Mono project, when in reality, the technical and licensing barriers to upgrading have long since disappeared, and the delay is due to Unity's own internal challenges and tech debt.

## [Show HN: Z80-μLM, a 'Conversational AI' That Fits in 40KB](https://github.com/HarryR/z80ai)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46417815

> **Project:** The project is 'Z80-μLM', a "Conversational AI" model designed to be extremely small, fitting entirely within a 40KB executable file. It is written in C and targets the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, a classic 8-bit CPU used in systems like the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MSX. The model is a minimal implementation of a language model, likely a character-level RNN or similar, trained on a tiny synthetic dataset (the author mentions a "20 Questions" style dataset). The goal is to demonstrate that a functional, albeit very limited, language model can run on severely constrained hardware from the 1980s, effectively simulating a "conversational AI" on such a machine.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to Z80-μLM was overwhelmingly positive, with users marveling at the technical achievement of fitting a language model into such a tiny footprint. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Nostalgia and Retro-Computing:** Many commenters expressed delight at the concept of running an AI on vintage hardware like a Game Boy or a custom Z80 computer. There was a shared sense of wonder at how "magical" this would have seemed in the 1980s, even if the conversational ability is rudimentary.
*   **Practical Applications and Demos:** A prominent request was for a Z80 simulator or emulator that could run the project, allowing people to play with it easily without needing physical hardware. One user noted a remarkable coincidence, mentioning they were working on a project involving a CP/M (Z80-based) emulator and coding agents, for which this tool would be a perfect fit.
*   **Technical and Conceptual Curiosity:** Users engaged in more technical speculation. One thread explored the idea of embedding a secret or "backdoor" into such a small model and whether it could be reverse-engineered from the weights, touching on the topic of AI interpretability. Another user humorously suggested using the model to solve the "ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything," highlighting the limitations of such a small AI.
*   **Data and SLM vs. LLM:** A suggestion was made to use modern LLMs to generate more robust synthetic training data for the project. The model was also referred to as a "SLM" (Small Language Model) in contrast to today's Large Language Models.

## [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46414475

> **Article:** The article "MongoBleed Explained Simply" details a critical information disclosure vulnerability in MongoDB. The bug, a use-after-free error in the database's memory allocator, could leak up to 100 bytes of uninitialized memory from the server's heap in response to certain requests. This leaked memory could contain sensitive data such as user credentials, authentication tokens, or internal database structures. The vulnerability was introduced in a 2019 code change and was present in all MongoDB versions until it was patched. The author also highlights the widespread exposure of MongoDB instances to the internet, making them susceptible to such exploits, and discusses the broader implications of using memory-unsafe languages like C++.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes: the root cause of the vulnerability, the security posture of MongoDB users, and the timeline of the vulnerability's disclosure.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the technical cause: using memory-unsafe languages. Commenters lamented the prevalence of such bugs and the lack of memory safety in C++. A notable counterpoint was raised by a Cloudflare engineer, who described a practice of overwriting freed memory with a static pattern, which they claimed mitigated similar bugs without a measurable performance cost. This sparked a sub-discussion on whether compilers could optimize such patterns away.

The vulnerability's impact was linked to common operational practices. Commenters pointed to the large number of MongoDB instances exposed to the internet, with many suggesting this is a symptom of a culture that prioritizes ease-of-use (e.g., avoiding schema design) over proper security measures like network isolation.

Finally, there was a debate over the article's accuracy regarding the disclosure timeline. It was clarified that MongoDB uses a private internal repository and publishes commits later, which explained the apparent discrepancies in dates. Other commenters corrected the author's claims about when Atlas clusters were patched. The discussion also touched on the standard security practice of not revealing exploit details until a patch is widely deployed, and the classic debate over whether `malloc` should zero-initialize memory by default.

## [PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python](https://pysdr.org/content/intro.html)
**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 8 | **ID:** 46413975

> **Article:** PySDR (pysdr.org) is a free online guide that teaches Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Python. It is designed to bridge the gap between complex theory and practical implementation, targeting readers who may not have a heavy math background but want to build real-world radio applications. The guide covers fundamental concepts like sampling, filtering, and modulation, and provides Python code examples to help readers understand and process radio signals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community received the guide with overwhelming positivity. Commenters described it as an excellent, practical resource suitable for both beginners and experts; even DSP professionals found the explanations delightful and useful for onboarding new team members.

Several users discussed the hardware aspect, noting that the recommended RTL-SDR is an affordable (around €50) and capable device. While it has limitations (8-bit resolution, noise), it is considered a standard tool that is sufficient for 90% of receiving tasks and remains useful even as skills advance.

There was one notable critique regarding the depth of the content. One user felt the guide was occasionally "hand-wavy" regarding the mathematical theory behind specific engineering choices (such as tuning loop parameters for frequency locking) and wished it provided more direction on how to derive those specific constants.

## [As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/28/nx-s1-5656190/ai-chips-memory-prices-ram)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 265 | **ID:** 46415338

> **Article:** The NPR article reports that the surge in demand for AI hardware is causing a shortage and price increase for memory chips (RAM), which will likely raise prices for consumer electronics like laptops and phones. Manufacturers are shifting production capacity from standard memory to more profitable High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) used in AI accelerators. While new factories are being built, they won't be operational until 2027, meaning high prices are expected to persist in the near term.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with users noting that prices for components like RAM are already "through the roof." The conversation explores the economic and technical implications of this shift.

There is a consensus that large corporations like Apple are insulated from immediate price hikes due to long-term supply contracts, while smaller manufacturers and consumers will feel the squeeze first. A recurring theme is the potential downstream effect on software development: some hope that hardware stagnation will force a return to efficiency and optimization, while others fear it will accelerate the shift to centralized cloud computing, where economies of scale are easier to achieve.

The discussion also touches on the socio-economic angle, with several users expressing cynicism. Some view the situation as a manufactured "racket" or monopoly designed to milk consumers, questioning whether governments will intervene. Others offer a more pragmatic economic view, noting that rising prices are a natural response to supply and demand, and that government intervention (like subsidies or rationing) has its own complex consequences. Finally, users debated the impact on specific hardware, clarifying that while SoCs with on-die memory might be spared, most devices using standard DRAM will be affected.

**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** The article "Staying ahead of censors in 2025" from the Tor Project forum details recent technical advancements in censorship circumvention, specifically focusing on the situation in Russia and Iran. It highlights the deployment of "Conjure," a system that leverages unused IP address space at cooperating ISPs to hide Tor bridge traffic. This method makes it difficult for censors to block Tor by IP range without causing significant collateral damage. The article also discusses the evolution of obfuscation techniques and the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between censors and circumvention tools, emphasizing the need for constant innovation to stay ahead of sophisticated blocking methods like active probing and deep packet inspection.

## [No, it's not a battleship](https://www.navalgazing.net/No-its-not)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 188 | **ID:** 46413790

> **Article:** The article on "Naval Gazing" argues that the proposed new class of large surface combatant, which President Trump has referred to as a "battleship," is not a battleship in the traditional sense. The author breaks down the technical definitions, explaining that a battleship is defined by its large-caliber naval guns (typically 11 inches or larger). The proposed ship, by contrast, is a multi-missile platform with no such guns, making it more akin to a heavily armed cruiser or destroyer. The article suggests the "battleship" label is a misnomer used for political rhetoric and grandstanding, rather than an accurate description of a naval vessel.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical and dismissive of the proposed ship, viewing it primarily as a political vanity project rather than a serious military development. The sentiment is that the proposal is characteristic of the Trump administration: an image-driven concept with no substance, likely to be abandoned once the president loses interest.

Several key themes emerged in the comments:

*   **Political Folly and Incompetence:** Many commenters see the proposal as a "half-baked thing" born from a staffer's bullet points. There is a strong belief that the Navy will simply "slow-roll" the project until the administration changes, wasting millions or billions of dollars in the process. The project is described as "showboating" that further delays meaningful procurement reform.
*   **Technical and Historical Comparisons:** Users drew parallels to other ambitious but flawed military projects. The "Homer" car from *The Simpsons* and the M2 Bradley's troubled development (from *The Pentagon Wars*) were cited as examples of how adding "cool" features can lead to disastrous results. The US Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyer was also mentioned as a real-world example of a "cybertruck of the seas"—an expensive, high-tech ship whose potential was squandered.
*   **Mockery and Satire:** A significant portion of the discussion is satirical. One user drafted an entire SNL sketch mocking the project, incorporating recent political scandals. Others made sarcastic remarks about gold encrustations and the ship sinking like the Swedish *Vasa*.
*   **Broader Critiques of US Naval Procurement:** Some comments used the news as a springboard to lament the state of the US Navy, describing it as being in "freefall" due to mismanagement and exploitation by defense contractors.
*   **Factual Corrections:** One thread corrected a joke about the administration renaming the "Department of Defense" to the "Department of War," clarifying that such a change would require an act of Congress and had not actually occurred.

## [Rich Hickey: Thanks AI](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/ea94e3741ff0a4e3af55b9fe6287887f)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46415945

> **Article:** The linked content is a short, sarcastic note from renowned software engineer Rich Hickey (creator of Clojure). Addressed to "AI", the note "thanks" it for generating "saccharine, sycophantic, and shallow" emails that praise him and his work. Hickey uses this to ironically highlight the low quality of AI-generated content, which he characterizes as "slop" that mimics appreciation without genuine understanding. He concludes by asking "AI" to stop sending him these messages.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is polarized, centering on the validity of Hickey's critique and the broader ethics of AI.

Many commenters, including the top-voted responses, strongly agree with Hickey. They view the AI-generated "thank you" notes as a glib and manipulative marketing tactic by AI companies, designed to feign appreciation for creators while profiting from their work. This group often uses the term "slop" to describe the low-quality output of generative AI and expresses concern that the industry is prioritizing automation over genuine innovation. A common theme is that these tools primarily automate repetitive, low-thought work, a reality that Hickey's philosophy of deep, deliberate design ("hammock time") stands in direct opposition to.

Conversely, a significant minority defends the use of AI, arguing that the criticism is cynical, hypocritical, or simply "cringe." Some suggest Hickey is "bandwagoning" on anti-AI sentiment, pointing out that he and other critics have worked for companies with their own ethical issues. Others argue that the technology is still in its infancy and that the focus should be on the people and corporations misusing the tools, not the tools themselves. A particularly nuanced take suggests that AI's ability to generate "slop" is only possible because much of human software development has already become repetitive and formulaic, and that the real issue is a lack of opportunities for creative problem-solving.

Finally, several users focused on the irony of the situation, either by humorously suggesting Hickey's own complaint reads like "slop" or by noting that the debate mirrors older arguments about technology (e.g., "guns don't kill people...").

## [Researchers discover molecular difference in autistic brains](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/molecular-difference-in-autistic-brains/)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46415129

> **Article:** Researchers at Yale University have published a study in *The American Journal of Psychiatry* identifying a molecular difference in the brains of autistic individuals. Using a novel EEG-based method to estimate neurotransmitter levels non-invasively, the team found that autistic participants had fewer available mGlu5 receptors for glutamate—the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter—compared to a control group. The study involved 32 participants (16 autistic, 16 neurotypical). The researchers caution that it is unclear whether this receptor deficit is a root cause of autism or a consequence of living with the condition. They suggest this discovery could eventually lead to new diagnostic tools or targeted therapies, though they explicitly warn against self-medicating with glutamate supplements.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reacted with a mix of scientific skepticism, methodological critique, and philosophical debate regarding the nature of autism. While some commenters found the potential for new diagnostic tools promising, the prevailing sentiment was one of caution regarding the study's limitations and the interpretation of its findings.

Key themes in the discussion included:

*   **Critique of Sample Size and Demographics:** Many users immediately flagged the small sample size (N=32) as insufficient for drawing broad conclusions, fearing it could lead to false positives. A specific critique was raised regarding a demographic mismatch: the study's control group was significantly more racially diverse than the autistic group (100% white), which commenters argued was a significant design flaw that could skew results.
*   **Causality vs. Correlation:** Users debated whether the receptor difference is a cause or an effect. Some likened it to a physical trait (like height) rather than a pathology, while others noted that receptor density changes in response to environmental factors, meaning the finding could simply reflect the brain's adaptation to the autistic experience rather than its origin.
*   **Dangers of "Treatment" and the Neurodiversity Perspective:** There was strong resistance to the idea of "fixing" the difference. Commenters argued that lower receptor levels might not be a deficit but a variation that offers cognitive advantages. They warned against rushing to "treat" a difference that might be integral to a person's identity or abilities, criticizing the article's headline for implying a problem to be solved.
*   **Heterogeneity of Autism:** Several users argued that treating autism as a monolithic condition is flawed. They pointed out that the "autism spectrum" encompasses vastly different neurological profiles and that lumping everyone together likely obscures meaningful data. There was a call for research to focus on specific phenotypes rather than generalizing across the entire spectrum.

## [62 years in the making: NYC's newest water tunnel nears the finish line](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/11/09/water--dep--tunnels-)
**Score:** 124 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46415426

> **Article:** The article reports on the imminent completion of New York City's Water Tunnel No. 3, a massive public works project that has been under construction for over 60 years, with origins dating back to 1954. The tunnel, which is featured in the film *Die Hard with a Vengeance*, is designed to deliver one billion gallons of water per day and has an expected service life of 200-300 years. The final phase, which will extend water service to Brooklyn and Queens, is projected to be finished by 2032. The tunnel is constructed 800 feet underground to pass beneath existing infrastructure and utilize gravity for water flow.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of pop culture references, technical curiosity, and broader commentary on public infrastructure. Many commenters immediately connected the project to the 1995 film *Die Hard with a Vengeance*, where the tunnel is a key plot point, noting the irony that the real-world project is only now nearing completion decades after the movie's release.

Technically, users explored the reasons for the tunnel's extreme depth (800 feet), concluding it is necessary to maintain a downhill gradient for gravity-fed water flow and to pass safely beneath the city's complex existing infrastructure. The immense difficulty and long timeline of the project sparked a wider debate about the challenges of modern public works. Commenters argued that the primary obstacles are not technical but political and financial, citing issues like corruption, graft, and inefficient bureaucracy that make such projects incredibly slow and expensive.

Finally, a few points of comparison were raised. One user questioned whether building such a massive tunnel still makes sense in an era of advancing desalination technology, but others countered that the gravity-fed system has extremely low operating costs compared to the energy required for desalination. The staggering cost and timescale of the tunnel were also used to put the massive private spending of tech companies into perspective.

The most significant is the introduction of BBA-IPC, a new system that allows the emulator to communicate with the host machine's network stack to improve Broadband Adapter (online play) support and reduce latency. Another major feature is the implementation of "Game Patches," which can apply dynamic code replacements to games at load time. The report highlights a specific patch for *F-Zero GX* that caps the game's internal logic loop, which significantly improves performance on lower-end hardware by preventing it from running too fast. Other updates include a new Wii System Menu theme, fixes for audio issues in several games, and general graphical backend improvements.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing admiration for the Dolphin team's technical skill, dedication, and transparency in their development process. Commenters praise the project as a "North Star" for emulators and wish corporate software had similarly detailed release notes.

Several key themes emerge:
*   **Preservation and Accessibility:** Users highlight Dolphin's critical role in preserving GameCube and Wii games as original hardware becomes old, expensive, and prone to failure. It's seen as a vital alternative to Nintendo's own "subpar" emulation efforts.
*   **Technical Details:** Some users delved into the specifics of the update, discussing the use of ZeroMQ for the new IPC library and celebrating the performance improvements from the new game patches.
*   **User Experience Challenges:** A contrasting theme is the complexity of controller setup for local multiplayer. One user shared a detailed, frustrating experience trying to manage multiple controllers and save states on a Steam Deck, suggesting that Dolphin's powerful but complex configuration can be a significant hurdle for casual or social use.
*   **General Curiosity:** A minor point of discussion was a user questioning the niche appeal of replaying old games in specific ways, which was largely left unanswered in the thread.

## [My app just won best iOS Japanese learning tool of 2025 award (blog)](https://skerritt.blog/best-japanese-learning-tools-2025-award-show/)
**Score:** 115 | **Comments:** 16 | **ID:** 46415819

> **Article:** The article is a blog post by the developer of Manabi Reader, an iOS and macOS app for learning Japanese through reading. The developer announces that their app has won the "best iOS Japanese learning tool of 2025" award from their own blog. The post details the app's features, which include tracking words and kanji you've learned, an offline-first architecture with iCloud sync, and integration with Anki for flashcard mining. The developer, who quit their job to work on the app full-time, also outlines future plans for manga mode (using a custom OCR model for vertical text) and Netflix/streaming video support with real-time captioning. The post concludes by mentioning the app's unique "pay what you can" pricing model and a new marketing push to make it more beginner-friendly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is centered on the credibility of the "award" and the merits of the Manabi Reader app. The primary point of contention is that the award is self-published on the developer's blog, which several users call out as misleading and clickbait. The developer defends the title by stating that no other major publications give out such awards, but the skepticism remains.

Beyond the title, the conversation shifts to the app itself. Users provide direct feedback, with one finding the default highlighting and annotations "intimidating" and "busy," and noting the lack of support for Yomitan-style custom dictionaries. The developer is highly responsive, acknowledging the feedback, sharing screenshots of an upcoming redesign that addresses these issues, and confirming that Yomitan dictionary support is a high priority and in development.

Other comments praise the app's utility and congratulate the developer. There is also a broader discussion about the best tools for learning Japanese, with users mentioning Yomitan and Anki as an unbeatable combination. One commenter offers a metaphorical piece of advice, emphasizing that while these software tools are powerful for building a vocabulary ("Software"), learners must not neglect the "Hardware" – training their brain to properly process Japanese sounds and pronunciation to achieve true fluency.

## [Spherical Cow](https://lib.rs/crates/spherical-cow)
**Score:** 101 | **Comments:** 15 | **ID:** 46415458

> **Article:** The article links to a Rust library on `lib.rs` named "spherical-cow". The library is a joke implementation of the "spherical cow" physics joke, where complex real-world problems are simplified by assuming cows are spheres. The library provides a `SphericalCow` struct and methods for calculating properties like volume and surface area. The project description humorously notes its "real world" application is optimizing the layout of inflatable space habitats on the Moon and Mars, referencing the "vacuum" part of the joke.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters primarily engaged with the library as a humor piece, with many expressing satisfaction that it delivered exactly what the title promised. Several users noted the historical origins of the "spherical cow" joke, tracing it back to comedy and pre-internet eras.

A more serious debate emerged regarding the nature of scientific modeling. One user argued that the joke's premise—that a solution works "only" for spherical cows in a vacuum—is logically flawed. They contended that a model is simply an abstraction, and a solution derived from it isn't necessarily invalid in the real world just because the abstraction is simplified. Other users countered this, pointing out that the original quote implies hard constraints where the solution fails if those specific conditions aren't met. They argued that to validate the model, one would only need to demonstrate failure under non-spherical or non-vacuum conditions, rather than building a complex model of "meat and air."

## [Panoramas of Star Trek Sets](https://mijofr.github.io/st-panorama/)
**Score:** 96 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46417752

> **Article:** The article links to an interactive website that hosts high-quality, 360-degree panoramic images of classic Star Trek sets. The project, a labor of love by a fan, extracts and presents QuickTime VR (QTVR) panoramas from 1990s-era sources, primarily the *Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) Technical Manual* CD-ROM and the *Captain's Chair* interactive game. The collection allows users to virtually explore iconic locations like the bridges of the Enterprise-D and the original series, as well as character quarters, from various viewpoints. It also includes a notable photo of the 2009 Star Trek movie bridge and a "behind the scenes" shot showing the original set photography rig.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction to the article was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters expressing delight and nostalgia for the immersive Star Trek experience. The discussion highlighted several key points:

*   **Nostalgia and Source:** Commenters immediately recognized the source material, reminiscing about the 1990s TNG Technical Manual CD-ROM and the novelty of QuickTime VR technology at the time. The project was praised for expertly preserving and making this classic content accessible again.
*   **Immersive Experience:** Many users were captivated by the realism and detail of the panoramas, with one remarking that their brain was tricked into feeling as if they had actually been on the Enterprise-D set. Several users reported losing significant time simply exploring the virtual environments.
*   **Technical Details and Easter Eggs:** The discussion included observations about the technical aspects of the original panoramas, such as the blurry reflection of the camera rig in a mirror, which one user speculated might have been intentionally designed to look like a sci-fi droid. Other users pointed out fun details like the location of the bathroom on the bridge.
*   **VR Potential:** A key takeaway was the modern potential for this content. Commenters noted that these full 360-degree photos are perfect for adaptation into modern Virtual Reality (VR) headsets for an even more immersive experience.
*   **Additional Resources:** The conversation also led to the sharing of a related, high-quality resource: the Roddenberry Archive, which offers detailed 3D models and virtual tours of the original Enterprise.

## [Show HN: My not-for-profit search engine with no ads, no AI, & all DDG bangs](https://nilch.org)
**Score:** 95 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46417748

> **Project:** The project, "nilch," is a new, not-for-profit search engine frontend. It is designed to be minimalist and ad-free, offering a clean alternative to mainstream search. Its core feature is full support for all DuckDuckGo (DDG) bangs, allowing users to instantly redirect searches to other sites (e.g., `!w` for Wikipedia, `!so` for Stack Overflow). The creator built it as a personal project to provide a simple, privacy-respecting search experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's response was a mix of praise, constructive feedback, and critical questions about the project's long-term viability and underlying technology.

The most prominent theme was the project's **technical foundation and sustainability**. Several commenters pointed out that nilch is currently just a "thin wrapper" using the Brave Search API, which makes it dependent on an external provider and susceptible to API costs. The creator acknowledged this, stating that building a full, independent search index is a future goal but is resource-intensive. This led to a broader discussion on the difficulty of creating a new search engine and suggestions for alternative open-source indexes like MarginaliaSearch. Sustainability was a major concern, with users worried about the cost of API calls and donations. The creator mentioned receiving some donations and implementing caching to manage costs.

A second key theme was the **philosophy of non-profit models and open-source ranking**. Users debated whether a non-profit search engine could truly exist without compromising user data, with one commenter arguing that even "ethical" ad models like Ecosia's still monetize user data. Another user argued that making the ranking algorithm open-source would be "antithetical to good search" because it would give spammers a blueprint to game the system. The creator was open to the idea of keeping the core algorithm secret or constantly tweaking it to combat manipulation.

Finally, there was significant **feature feedback and bug reporting**. Users quickly identified issues, such as errors with quoted search strings and a critical bug that occurred when the creator's API credits ran out. On the feature side, users requested custom bangs, autocomplete suggestions, and pointed out that nilch doesn't yet support some of DDG's more advanced bang syntaxes (like bangs in the middle of a query or the `!` redirect feature). The creator was responsive, acknowledging the bugs and expressing interest in implementing the suggested features.
