# Hacker News Summary - 2025-12-29

## [What an unprocessed photo looks like](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/)
**Score:** 2122 | **Comments:** 349 | **ID:** 46415225

> **Article:** The article "What an unprocessed photo looks like" demystifies the digital photography pipeline by showing the stages of image creation from raw sensor data to a final image. It explains that a camera sensor doesn't capture color, only light intensity. To capture color, a Bayer filter (a grid of red, green, and blue filters) is placed over the sensor, meaning each pixel only records one color. This raw data, which appears as a "mosaic" of single-color pixels with a strong green cast, is what a RAW file essentially is. The article then outlines the necessary processing steps to create a viewable image: de-Bayering (interpolating the missing two color values for each pixel), applying gamma correction (to make the linear light data appear correctly on a non-linear monitor), and adjusting dynamic range (compressing the wide range of light captured by the sensor to fit the narrower range of a display). The final result is a familiar-looking JPEG, but the article stresses that this is a heavily processed and interpreted version of the original data, not a direct "truth."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely praised the article for its clear explanation of the complex, hidden processes behind digital photography. A central theme was the philosophical debate over what constitutes a "real" or "unprocessed" photo. Many commenters argued that every photo is an interpretation, as even the in-camera JPEG is the result of a thousand choices and automated processes. They contended that "fake" should be defined by the intent to deceive, not by the act of editing, and that manually controlling the processing pipeline is a legitimate artistic choice, not a crime.

Several technical points were elaborated on. Users explained the Bayer filter in more detail, noting that the higher proportion of green pixels is because the human eye is most sensitive to green luminance, making it crucial for perceived sharpness. The discussion also covered the necessity of gamma correction, not just for monitors but for efficient data allocation and because of the non-linear response of capture media like film and sensors. The conversation extended to the role of AI, with some noting that machine learning algorithms for demosaicing have been standard for years, blurring the line between "traditional" processing and modern AI. Ultimately, the consensus was that the article effectively peeled back the "abstraction layer" of images, revealing that photography is fundamentally signal processing.

## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 626 | **Comments:** 642 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" is a first-person account of a disastrous train journey in Germany. The author describes a series of cascading failures: a cancelled train, a replacement bus that never arrives, and finally being put on an Intercity train that is not scheduled to stop at his destination. Despite the author's pleas and the fact that the train does stop at the station, the staff refuse to let him disembark, citing regulations. He is forcibly taken 60km past his destination to a different city, with no clear information or assistance provided on how to get back. The author frames this experience not as a simple delay, but as a complete loss of control and a failure of the system to serve its passengers, coining the term "kidnapped" to express his frustration with being helpless against bureaucratic indifference.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around a central debate: is Deutsche Bahn (DB) uniquely dysfunctional, or is it just part of a global decline in rail service, particularly when compared to other countries?

A significant portion of the comments corroborate the article's premise, sharing personal anecdotes of extreme delays, poor communication, and unhelpful staff, not just in Germany but also in the UK, France, and Italy. These commenters express a shared sense of frustration with the normalization of failure in European rail systems. The comparison to the UK is a major sub-thread, with users debating whether the UK's high prices and frequent cancellations are worse than DB's reliability issues. One user points out that while UK customer service for claims (like "Delay Repay") can be excellent, the overall experience is still poor.

However, a strong counter-narrative emerges, primarily from a user who has lived in Germany for years and compares it favorably to the US system. This perspective argues that German passengers have an "insatiable attitude" and lack perspective, and that most delays are due to unpredictable events (like accidents or technical faults) that are difficult to prevent. This view is challenged by others who claim that better planning and redundancy could mitigate such issues.

Finally, there is a discussion on the root causes and potential solutions. Some commenters blame insecure jobs and poor contracts for staff apathy, while others suggest that financial incentives, similar to airline compensation rules, are needed to force operators to improve. The linguistic challenges faced by non-German speakers are also highlighted as a significant failure in a modern, international travel environment.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 463 | **Comments:** 154 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that modern browsers will render any non-standard HTML tag (e.g., `<my-custom-tag>`) without errors. By default, these unknown elements behave like inline `<span>` elements, allowing developers to use semantically meaningful or custom tag names in their markup and style them with CSS just like standard elements. The author presents this as a simple, native feature of HTML that can be used for structuring content without relying on `div` or `span` soup.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but quickly expands on it, focusing on the distinction between "bare" custom tags and the formal **Web Components** standard.

A key technical clarification is that the browser's behavior depends on the tag name. Tags containing a hyphen (e.g., `<my-tag>`) are treated as valid custom elements and instantiate as `HTMLElement`, while tags without a hyphen become `HTMLUnknownElement`. This distinction is important for potential future browser upgrades.

The conversation then pivots to the power of the full **Custom Elements API**, which allows developers to attach JavaScript behavior to these tags, creating reusable components. This leads to a recurring theme: a preference for this native, standards-based approach over large JavaScript frameworks like React for many use cases. Several users express that Web Components are underrated and can often provide a simpler solution for UI needs without the overhead of a full framework.

Finally, there is a debate over the article's specific examples. Some commenters argue that the proposed custom tags (like `<article-header>`) are redundant because standard, semantic HTML5 tags (`<article>`, `<header>`) already exist and are preferable for accessibility and SEO. The consensus is that while making up tags is technically possible and useful for specific component needs, it shouldn't replace the use of standard, semantic HTML where applicable.

## [Show HN: Z80-μLM, a 'Conversational AI' That Fits in 40KB](https://github.com/HarryR/z80ai)
**Score:** 388 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46417815

> **Project:** The project is a "Conversational AI" model named Z80-μLM, designed to run on a Z80-based microcomputer. The entire model, including its weights and inference logic, fits within a 40KB executable file (`.com`). It is a highly specialized, tiny language model (SLM) that uses a simple lookup-based approach with pre-defined question-answer pairs to simulate conversation, rather than performing complex neural network inference. The project is presented as a demonstration of extreme software minimalism for retro hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with enthusiasm, primarily focusing on the project's novelty and potential applications in the retro-computing space. The most prominent theme was the desire for an emulator or simulator to allow people to interact with the AI without needing physical hardware. Several users expressed excitement about the prospect of running such a program on classic systems like a Game Boy or their own custom-built Z80 computers, marveling at the idea of a "conversational AI" in such a constrained environment.

Some discussion branched into technical and conceptual topics. One user questioned the security of embedding a secret within the model's weights, which led to a brief conversation about machine learning interpretability and research into "undetectable backdoors." Another interesting thread emerged from a user who realized the project perfectly fit into their own ongoing work with a Z80 emulator and coding agents, prompting another user to share a related project they had built. The tone was generally appreciative, with users enjoying the cleverness of the implementation and its nostalgic appeal.

## [As AI gobbles up chips, prices for devices may rise](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/28/nx-s1-5656190/ai-chips-memory-prices-ram)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 412 | **ID:** 46415338

> **Article:** An NPR article reports that the high demand for AI hardware is causing a shortage and price increase for memory chips (RAM). This is driven by AI companies buying up vast quantities of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for their GPUs. The article notes that this is causing a ripple effect, with manufacturers redirecting production from standard consumer RAM to the more profitable AI-focused memory. While new factories are being built, they won't be online for several years, meaning consumers can expect to pay more for devices like PCs and phones in the near future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with users noting that prices for components like RAM are already "through the roof." The conversation explores the real-world consequences and potential outcomes of this trend.

A key theme is the impact on consumers and the market. Users observe that budget electronics are already shipping with lower specs (e.g., 8GB RAM) at higher prices. There's a cynical consensus that this is a "racket" or price-gouging scheme, with some pointing out that large corporations like Apple can secure long-term pricing, insulating them from the immediate shock while smaller consumers bear the brunt. One user offers a grimly humorous take on how consumers will adapt: "vodka's more expensive now... You're gonna eat less."

The discussion also branches into two opposing technological futures. One perspective is optimistic, suggesting that hardware stagnation will force a renaissance in software efficiency, with developers returning to more optimized, native-compiled languages. The counter-argument is that this will accelerate the shift to centralized cloud computing, where economies of scale make high-performance hardware more accessible, further eroding the viability of powerful local desktops.

Finally, there's significant debate around the role of government and the nature of the market. While some call for intervention to stop the "milking scheme," others argue that this is a natural supply-and-demand issue, not a monopoly. The proposed solution is for governments to subsidize domestic semiconductor manufacturing to increase supply, rather than attempting to control prices. A minor technical thread also clarified that SoCs with on-package DRAM (like in Apple devices) are still affected by the shortage, as they use the same memory dice as everyone else.

## [Stepping down as Mockito maintainer after ten years](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46414078

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub issue where Brice Dutheil announces he is stepping down as the maintainer of Mockito, a popular mocking framework for Java, after ten years. He cites burnout and an "energy drain" as the primary reasons. A key contributing factor was the difficulty of adapting to recent changes in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), specifically JEP 451, which disallows the dynamic loading of agents by default. This forced Mockito 5 to ship a breaking change, requiring users to add a flag to their test runs. Dutheil also expresses frustration with the complexity introduced by Kotlin support and a perceived lack of support from the broader JVM ecosystem during these transitions. He concludes by referencing the classic XKCD comic about the fragility of open-source infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes: the nature of the JVM changes, the role and philosophy of mocking, and the challenges of open-source maintenance.

A significant portion of the debate focused on the technical conflict between Mockito's needs and the JVM's evolution. Commenters explained that JEP 451 was driven by a platform-wide "Integrity by Default" policy to enhance security and performance. While some defended this as a necessary long-term improvement, others, including library maintainers, argued that such changes can be disruptive and that the burden of adaptation is often placed on them. The core question was whether enabling a flag for tests is a reasonable compromise or a sign that the tool is becoming obsolete.

The discussion also branched into a broader philosophical debate on testing practices. Several developers argued that mocking is overused and often a "code smell" indicating poor application design. They advocated for using real implementations or fakes instead of mocks, which they claim lead to brittle and hard-to-maintain tests. However, others defended mocking as a pragmatic necessity for dealing with legacy codebases that are not designed for testability.

Finally, there was a strong sentiment of empathy for the maintainer, acknowledging the thanklessness and burnout inherent in long-term open-source stewardship. Many commenters expressed gratitude for Dutheil's decade of work, while others debated whether financial compensation is the only or best solution to prevent maintainer burnout.

## [Software engineers should be a little bit cynical](https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical/)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 189 | **ID:** 46414723

> **Article:** The article "Software engineers should be a little bit cynical" by Sean Goedecke argues that software engineers should adopt a "clear-eyed cynicism" to navigate corporate realities without becoming ineffective or demoralized. Goedecke contrasts two common mindsets: the "idealist" who believes companies are benevolent and the "cynic" who views the corporate world as a "late-stage-capitalist hellscape."

He argues that the extreme idealist is naive and prone to burnout when their expectations are shattered, while the extreme cynic becomes paralyzed and self-sabotaging, assuming bad faith everywhere. The proposed middle path is to be cynical about corporate motivations (e.g., companies exist to make money, executives prioritize shareholder value) but idealistic about your own agency and ability to effect change within your sphere of influence. This means accepting that you aren't the CEO, but your technical decisions and advocacy still matter for product quality and user experience. Ultimately, this balanced approach allows engineers to protect their mental health while still doing meaningful work.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's core premise but adds significant nuance and skepticism. There is broad agreement that a degree of cynicism is a necessary defense mechanism in the corporate world. Several commenters share that this mindset has protected them from emotional burnout and disillusionment.

The conversation expands on the article in several key areas:

*   **The Nature of Leadership:** Multiple commenters push back on the author's defense of C-level executives. They argue that while executives may *say* they want to build good products, their primary and overriding motivation is shareholder value. Some shared anecdotes of C-suite leaders being described as "super-powerful young children" who need to be managed with flattery and "play-pretend" tactics, suggesting their decisions are not always rational or product-focused.

*   **Cynicism vs. Optimism:** A counterpoint was raised that pure cynicism, while feeling smart, can prevent engineers from achieving unlikely, ambitious outcomes. This view suggests that a degree of optimism (or even naivete) is required to muster the energy to "get lucky" and create significant change.

*   **Individual Agency vs. Systemic Issues:** The discussion explored the limits of individual influence. While the author suggests engineers have significant power in translating business goals into technical reality, some commenters argued that the employee role itself is fundamentally limiting. They proposed that true autonomy and impact often require leaving the traditional employee structure to become a consultant or founder.

*   **Bad Faith vs. Bad Systems:** One thread debated whether corporate dysfunction stems from individual malice or systemic failures. A commenter argued that most people, including managers and salespeople, genuinely want to do good work but are hampered by poor feedback loops and communication. Others countered that this doesn't negate the existence of bad faith actors, particularly in sales and executive roles.

*   **The "Tech Worker" Critique:** A more radical cynical take emerged, arguing that any idealism in big tech is a self-deluding illusion to cope with working for companies that have abandoned ethical principles. From this perspective, the only rational position is to acknowledge you've "sold your soul" for money and enjoy the paycheck without pretense.

## [Unity's Mono problem: Why your C# code runs slower than it should](https://marekfiser.com/blog/mono-vs-dot-net-in-unity/)
**Score:** 250 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46414819

> **Article:** The article "Unity's Mono problem" argues that Unity's C# performance lags behind modern .NET because it is still based on an outdated version of the Mono runtime. The author demonstrates with benchmarks that a simple file-loading and data-processing task runs significantly slower in Unity's Mono environment compared to a standard .NET 8 application. The piece briefly traces this history, noting that Unity's reliance on Mono was a practical choice in 2006 but has become a technical debt that hinders performance and access to modern C# features. The author concludes that a migration to Microsoft's CoreCLR is essential for Unity to remain competitive.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but provides significant context and historical background. A central theme is the long and slow-moving transition to CoreCLR. While Unity has announced official plans and timelines for this migration (targeting 2026), commenters express frustration with the slow progress and speculate that Unity may lack the technical resources to complete the complex port.

Historical context is a major point of discussion. Several users recall that for years, Unity deflected blame for its outdated C# support onto the Mono project's licensing. However, it's pointed out that Mono was relicensed to MIT and has long had modern features (like a better garbage collector) that Unity's fork did not adopt, making Unity primarily responsible for its own technical stagnation.

The conversation also delves into the nuances of Unity's performance ecosystem. Commenters clarify that most performance-critical Unity games use IL2CPP, not the Mono runtime, and that Unity's own high-performance solutions like the Burst compiler and HPC# are the recommended path for optimization. However, another user counters that these proprietary systems are complex and often fall short of the performance and convenience of modern .NET or well-written C++.

Specific technical issues are highlighted, particularly the poor performance of Unity's Boehm garbage collector compared to modern .NET's GC. There's also debate over the article's methodology (profiling debug builds), though some argue this is a valid approach for developer workflow improvements. The discussion concludes with a general sentiment that while the move to CoreCLR is welcome for access to modern language features, the performance gains may be less dramatic for developers who have already adopted Unity's specific high-performance toolchains.

## [MongoBleed Explained Simply](https://bigdata.2minutestreaming.com/p/mongobleed-explained-simply)
**Score:** 235 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46414475

> **Article:** The article "MongoBleed Explained Simply" describes a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-56879) in MongoDB's C++ client library. The bug is a classic "uninitialized memory read" flaw. When the library allocates memory for a certain data structure, it fails to initialize it, instead receiving a chunk of memory that may contain leftover data from previous operations. This can leak sensitive information, such as authentication keys or internal state, from the server's memory to a potential attacker.

The author explains that this is a common issue in memory-unsafe languages like C++ and contrasts it with languages like Go or Rust, which automatically zero-out memory on allocation to prevent such leaks. The article also addresses confusion around the timeline of the bug's discovery and patching, clarifying that MongoDB uses an internal repository and pushes changes to the public one later, which explains discrepancies in commit dates. It concludes by noting that MongoDB Atlas (the managed cloud service) was patched automatically before the public disclosure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes:

*   **Root Cause and Prevention:** Commenters universally identified the use of C++ as the underlying problem. A prominent suggestion, backed by an anecdote from a Cloudflare engineer, was to use memory allocators that overwrite freed memory with a specific pattern. This would ensure that any subsequent uninitialized allocation contains harmless, predictable data rather than sensitive leftovers. The feasibility of this was debated, with one user noting that compilers might optimize such writes away.

*   **Security Hygiene and Exposed Databases:** A major point of discussion was the prevalence of MongoDB instances exposed directly to the internet. Users linked to Shodan scans showing hundreds of thousands of exposed databases, attributing this to a culture of prioritizing ease-of-use (e.g., avoiding schema design) over proper security practices like setting up private networks.

*   **MongoDB's Development Process:** Some confusion in the discussion mirrored the article's own, regarding the timeline of the bug fix. A commenter clarified that MongoDB develops in a private repository and uses a tool (Copybara) to publish commits to GitHub later, which explains why the public fix commit appeared to have no review and post-dated the disclosure.

*   **General Sentiment and Humor:** The conversation included a mix of serious analysis and typical HN cynicism. This included skepticism about MongoDB's "no evidence of exploitation" statement, a recurring joke about "webscale," and a debate over whether it's fair to blame the tool (MongoDB) versus the user (for poor configuration).

## [CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them? (2021)](https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies/2023/05/ceos-salaries-expensive-automate-robots)
**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 282 | **ID:** 46415488

> **Article:** The article, "CEOs are hugely expensive. Why not automate them?", argues that the massive compensation packages for top executives are ripe for disruption by AI. It posits that many CEO functions—such as analyzing business data, synthesizing reports, and making strategic decisions based on metrics—are fundamentally data-processing tasks that an advanced AI could perform more efficiently and at a fraction of the cost. The author suggests that an AI CEO could even outperform human executives by being immune to ego, bias, and the short-term pressures of the stock market, ultimately leading to better long-term company health.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely refutes the article's premise, arguing that the CEO role is uniquely difficult to automate. The consensus is that a CEO's primary value lies in "soft skills" that are currently beyond the reach of AI.

Key points of contention include:

*   **The Human Element is Irreplaceable:** The most frequent counterargument is that a CEO's job is fundamentally about human interaction, not data analysis. Commenters emphasized the importance of networking with other leaders, selling a vision to employees and investors, negotiating with the board, and providing leadership through crises—all deeply social and emotional tasks.
*   **Legal and Fiduciary Accountability:** Several users pointed out the legal impossibility of delegating a CEO's fiduciary duties to a machine. Corporate law, particularly in the U.S., requires that these responsibilities be held by a "natural person," creating a significant legal barrier to an AI CEO.
*   **The "Real" Problem is Power, Not Technology:** A prominent theme was that the issue isn't whether AI *can* replace CEOs, but whether the powerful individuals who control companies would ever allow it. One highly-upvoted comment argued that executives use the *threat* of AI to replace other workers and suppress wages, while simultaneously protecting their own "exclusive club" through networking and PR.
*   **Who Watches the Watchers?** A sub-thread debated the accountability of an AI CEO, questioning who would be legally responsible for its decisions. The conclusion was that either the humans overseeing the AI or the AI's vendor would be held liable, creating a risk that no company or vendor would want to take.
*   **Irony and Sarcasm:** Many comments used humor to highlight the absurdity of the idea, suggesting that if CEOs are so keen to automate everyone else, they should be willing to automate themselves. One user quipped that automating a CEO might be easier than automating a sex worker, as the former doesn't "need a body."

**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 240 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** The article "Staying ahead of censors in 2025" from the Tor Project forum details the evolution of censorship circumvention techniques in response to advanced Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) used by states like Iran and Russia. The core argument is that simple obfuscation (making traffic look random) is no longer effective, as censors now flag any non-standard traffic patterns. The new strategy is "mimicry," where Tor traffic is designed to be indistinguishable from legitimate, uncensored internet traffic. Key technologies discussed include WebTunnel, which mimics standard HTTPS traffic by hiding within legitimate web server infrastructure, and Conjure, which leverages unused IP address space at the ISP level to hide the initial handshake, making it impossible to block without risking collateral damage to future legitimate services.

## [PySDR: A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python](https://pysdr.org/content/intro.html)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 12 | **ID:** 46413975

> **Article:** The article links to "PySDR," an online guide titled "A Guide to SDR and DSP Using Python." It is a comprehensive, practical resource for learning Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP). The guide uses Python for examples and code, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation. It covers fundamental topics like Fourier transforms, filtering, and modulation, making it accessible for beginners while remaining a useful reference for experienced engineers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community received the PySDR guide with overwhelming positivity. Commenters described it as an "excellent resource" that is practical and engineering-oriented. It is praised by both novices learning the basics and DSP experts who find it a delightful and useful reference for themselves or for training new team members.

The discussion also included practical advice on hardware. Users confirmed that a cheap RTL-SDR device (around 50 euros) is more than sufficient for learning and handles the majority of receiving tasks, even for those with more experience.

A minor critical thread focused on the guide's "hand-waviness" regarding specific implementation details, such as how to choose certain loop parameters. However, this was tempered by the fact that it's a free resource. One commenter suggested that modern LLMs are the perfect tool to fill in these specific knowledge gaps, acting as a "personal graduate-level TA" to answer such detailed questions.

## [Show HN: Vibe coding a bookshelf with Claude Code](https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46420453

> **Project:** The project is a personal "bookshelf" web application created using "vibe coding" with Claude Code. The author demonstrates using an AI coding assistant to rapidly build a single-user, locally-running application that works exactly to their personal specifications. The resulting tool is a visually appealing and functional page for organizing and displaying books, highlighting the accessibility of creating custom software for personal use without deep coding fluency.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters praising the project as an ideal use case for "vibe coding"—creating small, personal, and highly customized software. A key theme was the distinction between intent and execution, where the human provides the vision and taste while the AI handles the implementation. This was seen as a major productivity boost, especially for developers who don't code daily.

However, a significant counterpoint emerged regarding the limits of this approach. Commenters noted that as project size and complexity increase, "vibe coding" becomes less effective. At scale, AI models struggle with context, often generating redundant abstractions and subtle bugs. The consensus was that for larger projects, a more disciplined approach is necessary, where the human architect designs the structure and uses the AI as a focused tool to fill in the details, rather than letting it generate the entire codebase.

The conversation also touched on the nature of "taste," with some arguing that it's a key human advantage that AI cannot yet replicate, while others were more cynical, suggesting that many people's taste is not particularly refined and that AI-generated content is often "good enough." Finally, the project evoked nostalgia for classic software like Delicious Library, with several commenters reminiscing about its satisfying user experience.

## [Researchers discover molecular difference in autistic brains](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/molecular-difference-in-autistic-brains/)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46415129

> **Article:** Researchers from Yale University published a study in *The American Journal of Psychiatry* identifying a molecular difference in the brains of autistic individuals. Using a new EEG-based method to measure neurotransmitter receptors, they found that autistic brains have fewer glutamate receptors (specifically mGlu5) compared to neurotypical brains. Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The study involved 16 autistic adults and 16 control subjects. The researchers suggest this receptor deficit could be a root cause of autism or a consequence of living with the condition, and they hope the new non-invasive measurement technique will facilitate larger-scale research.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reacted to the study with a mixture of scientific skepticism, methodological critique, and philosophical debate about the nature of autism.

A significant portion of the comments focused on the study's limitations. Users pointed out the very small sample size (N=32, with only 16 autistic subjects), arguing that such a small number makes the findings susceptible to random chance and difficult to generalize. Several commenters highlighted a critical demographic mismatch in the study groups: the autistic subjects were 100% White, while the control group was only 37.5% White, a flaw that undermines the validity of the comparison.

Beyond the methodology, there was considerable debate over the implications of the findings. While one user asked about potential "easy-to-try treatments" like nutritional supplements, others immediately cautioned against such simplistic approaches. Commenters noted that the brain's homeostatic mechanisms would likely prevent simple supplementation from working, and that flooding a brain with fewer receptors with more glutamate could be harmful rather than helpful. The developmental nature of autism was also raised, with the point made that even if the cause were understood in adults, the brain's structure is already formed and may not be reversible.

Finally, the discussion broadened to a critique of how autism is researched and defined. Several users argued that treating autism as a single, monolithic condition is a fundamental flaw. They called for research to be more specific, categorizing autistic individuals by sensory sensitivities or other distinct phenotypes, rather than generalizing across the entire spectrum. This reflects a broader tension between viewing autism as a disorder requiring a "cure" versus a different way of being that doesn't need to be "fixed."

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder: What it means for you](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red, the parent company of the digital game store GOG, is selling GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The official rationale is strategic: CD Projekt wants to focus exclusively on developing high-quality RPGs (like *Cyberpunk 2077* and *The Witcher*), while GOG gains an owner dedicated to its specific mission. The acquisition aims to provide GOG with stronger backing to pursue its goals of selling DRM-free games and preserving classic titles. GOG's leadership emphasizes that the store is financially stable and that this move secures its future independence and commitment to its core values.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the acquisition, viewing GOG as a vital "oasis of ethical business" in the tech industry. The dominant theme was support for GOG's pro-consumer, DRM-free model, with many users stating they prioritize buying from GOG over Steam to achieve true ownership of their games. There was a shared sense of relief that GOG would be shielded from the shareholder pressures that might have otherwise led to its closure if CD Projekt faced another major financial flop.

However, the discussion also featured significant skepticism. Several commenters questioned the "financially stable" narrative presented in the official announcement, interpreting the optimistic language as a potential sign of underlying trouble. Technical requests were also prominent, with Linux users specifically asking for an official client or better support for third-party tools like Heroic Games Launcher. Finally, some users debated the business logic of selling a storefront in an era where competitors are building their own, while others appreciated the move toward a more focused, independent structure for both companies.

> **Article:** The linked content is a short, sarcastic note from renowned software engineer Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure. Addressed to "AI", the note "thanks" it for making his job easier by providing a constant stream of "slop" (low-quality, repetitive content). Hickey argues that because AI-generated code and content are flooding the internet, he no longer needs to find novel criticisms of the industry; he can simply point to the existing examples of poor design, lack of coherence, and "magical thinking" that AI produces. He concludes that AI is the best thing to ever happen to critics of the software industry, as it validates all their concerns on a massive scale.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the validity of Hickey's critique and the broader impact of generative AI. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes.

A significant portion of the comments strongly agree with Hickey, coining terms like "slopbaiting" to describe the phenomenon of AI generating vast amounts of low-quality content. These users express a sense of vindication, feeling that the current trajectory of AI development is a strange and damaging departure from meaningful innovation. They are particularly critical of the "saccharine" thank-you notes generated by AI towards influential figures, viewing it as a glib and manipulative attempt to address the technology's ethical issues, such as using creators' work without compensation.

On the other side, several commenters dismiss Hickey's critique as cynical, hypocritical, or an uninformed "tirade." They argue that the backlash is bandwagoning and that the same figures (like Hickey and Rob Pike) profited immensely from previous tech waves and are now taking a stand from a position of financial security. Others defend the utility of AI tools, suggesting that if the output seems repetitive, it's because the underlying human work has become repetitive, and AI is simply automating that. Some even challenge the critics, suggesting that human-generated "slop" is often no better and that the critics' own arguments are poorly constructed.

Finally, the discussion touches on responsibility and the nature of the technology itself. One prominent thread argues that the focus should be on the people and corporations who choose to use these tools for harmful purposes (e.g., for spam or to bypass regulation), rather than blaming the tool itself. This line of reasoning is compared to debates about other technologies like firearms. There is also a meta-discussion about whether the AI or the user is the true "author" of the generated content, with some pointing out that the AI is the entity physically writing the code or text based on its instructions.

## [No, it's not a battleship](https://www.navalgazing.net/No-its-not)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46413790

> **Article:** The article on NavalGazing.net analyzes a recent proposal by the Trump administration for a new class of large, heavily armed surface combatants, which the President has referred to as a "battleship." The author argues that this is a misnomer, as true battleships are defined by their thick armor and large-caliber ballistic guns, a design philosophy made obsolete by modern anti-ship missiles. The proposed vessel, despite its "battleship" label, is envisioned to have an all-missile main battery, supplemented by smaller guns, lasers, and a railgun. The author dismisses the proposal as a "fantasy" and "propaganda," likely based on a simple bullet-point list rather than a real naval requirement. They conclude that the plan is a politically-driven "showboat" project that will likely be ignored by the Navy and quietly shelved once the administration loses interest, comparing it to a teenage armchair general's dream.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical and dismissive of the proposed "battleship," viewing it as a symptom of a dysfunctional political and procurement system rather than a serious military proposal. The dominant sentiment is that the project is a vanity project driven by political whim, which will ultimately be wasted time and money.

Many commenters express cynicism about the proposal's viability and the political context. They suggest the plan is nothing more than a "bullet list" from staffers that the President liked, and that the Navy will simply "slow-roll" the project until the administration changes. This is framed as another example of a long history of disastrous defense procurement, with one user lamenting that taxpayers will lose another 4+ years and billions of dollars to "Trump's idiotic showboating." The proposal is seen as a predictable outcome of a leadership style that excels at "destroying existing functional structures than building functional things."

The proposal itself is frequently ridiculed with several analogies and jokes:
*   **The Homer:** It's compared to "The Homer," the disastrous, feature-laden car designed by Homer Simpson, suggesting it's a product of ego rather than sound engineering.
*   **The Cybertruck:** Another comparison is made to Tesla's Cybertruck, implying it's an impractical, overhyped design that will likely be shelved.
*   **SNL Sketch:** One user provides a detailed, satirical sketch idea mocking the proposal, the President's personal scandals, and his tendency to exaggerate, contrasting it with the Obama administration's more substantive legacy.

Beyond the political satire, commenters also critique the proposal on technical and strategic grounds. They point out that the proposed features (like railguns and lasers) are either defunct or still in development. The Zumwalt-class destroyer is mentioned as a real-world example of a "cybertruck of the seas"—an expensive, ambitious project whose potential was squandered. There is also a broader discussion about the state of the US Navy, with some arguing it's in "freefall" and that its real problem is mismanagement and exploitation by defense contractors, not a lack of ambitious projects. The debate touches on whether the US should focus on maintaining its existing fleet rather than pursuing new, costly designs.

## [Huge Binaries](https://fzakaria.com/2025/12/28/huge-binaries)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46417791

> **Article:** The article "Huge Binaries" by fzakaria.com discusses the technical challenge of building executables that exceed 2GB in size. This size is a critical threshold on x86-64 architecture because the default "small" code model uses 32-bit relative addresses, which limits call/jump distances. When a binary's `.text` section grows beyond 2GB, the linker can no longer generate these relative calls, causing the build to fail.

The author presents a problem they encountered where a binary grew to 25GiB (primarily due to debug symbols). They explore the common solution of using the `-mcmodel=large` flag, which forces the compiler to generate 64-bit absolute addresses. However, this comes with a performance penalty due to increased register pressure and less efficient code. The article details the author's investigation into this problem and their exploration of alternative strategies, such as using trampolines (thunks) to bridge the distance between code sections without resorting to the large code model.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the "why" behind such massive binaries and the trade-offs involved. A key theme was the distinction between the size of the executable code and the size of debug symbols. Many commenters, including one who worked at Google, clarified that 25GiB binaries are plausible when including full debug information, which can be enormous for large C++ projects due to template instantiations and type information. However, several engineers expressed horror at the idea of a 2GB+ `.text` section (executable code), viewing it as a sign of poor engineering, such as a lack of dead code elimination via Link-Time Optimization (LTO) or a failure to recognize that a single binary has grown into a collection of multiple applications.

The discussion also explored the cultural and operational aspects of this issue at large tech companies. One commenter noted that at a place like Google, the default response to performance problems caused by bloat was to "throw more infrastructure at it" rather than addressing the root cause of the bloat itself. Another pointed out the practical downsides of static linking, such as the inability to share library code and complex dependency management, while also acknowledging that dynamic linking C++ is notoriously difficult.

Finally, the conversation touched on advanced technical solutions. Some commenters mentioned tools like Facebook's BOLT for optimizing code layout and the use of trampolines (thunks) as an alternative to the large code model. The author of the article even joined the discussion to mention a follow-up post they were writing on the topic of thunks.

**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 17 | **ID:** 46417752

> **Article:** The article links to an interactive website that hosts high-quality, 360-degree panoramic photos of classic Star Trek sets, primarily from *The Next Generation* (TNG). The panoramas are extracted from 1990s-era QuickTime VR (QTVR) files found on old CD-ROMs like the *TNG Technical Manual* and *Captain's Chair* game. Users can navigate between different viewpoints on a floor plan, allowing for an immersive virtual tour of iconic locations such as the Enterprise-D bridge, crew quarters, and other key sets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with widespread nostalgia and delight, with many users commenting on how much time they lost exploring the virtual sets. The discussion highlights the technical origins of the panoramas, noting they were extracted from 1990s QTVR files, a "new hot thing" at the time. Users pointed out several interesting details, such as a blurry reflection of the camera equipment in the mirrors of the crew quarters, the location of the bridge bathroom, and the shock-absorbing suspension on the floor of the Bird-of-Prey set. A link was shared to another archive of Star Trek assets from the Roddenberry Archive. While most comments were positive, one user expressed disappointment that the newer *Strange New Worlds* sets were not included.
