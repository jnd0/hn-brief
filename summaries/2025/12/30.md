## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 968 | **Comments:** 862 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" is a first-person account of a disastrous train journey in Germany. The author describes a series of cascading failures: a delayed train, a missed connection, and being rerouted onto a bus that took him to a completely different and unintended destination. The core of the complaint is the lack of communication and inflexible bureaucracy. The bus driver, following protocol, refused to let the author off at a logical stop because it wasn't on his official route, forcing him to travel 60km past his intended destination. The author portrays this experience not as a simple delay, but as a complete loss of control and a failure of a system that should be serving its customers.

## [Google is dead. Where do we go now?](https://www.circusscientist.com/2025/12/29/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/)
**Score:** 573 | **Comments:** 533 | **ID:** 46425198

> **Article:** The article, from the perspective of a small business owner in Durban, South Africa, laments the "death" of Google AdWords. The author, who runs a small entertainment agency, details how their AdWords campaigns have become ineffective and prohibitively expensive, failing to generate the leads they once did. The core argument is that the system is now broken for small businesses, citing issues like high costs, potential click fraud, and the inability to compete with larger advertisers. The author is searching for a viable alternative for reaching local customers, a problem they feel is shared by many other small businesses.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion revolves around several key themes, largely validating the article's premise while also offering broader context and solutions.

Many commenters, including small business owners, shared the author's experience, confirming that Google Ads have become less effective and more expensive. The conversation frequently touched upon the negative impact of AI on the open web, suggesting that as users retreat to "walled gardens" and AI provides direct answers, the ecosystem that AdWords relied on is decaying.

A major point of debate was whether "Google is dead." Most agreed that while AdWords may be failing for small players, the company itself is financially stronger than ever. The discussion clarified that the article was specifically about the advertising platform, not the search engine's utility.

Alternative platforms were suggested, but often with skepticism. While Kagi was mentioned as a superior search product, commenters noted its dependence on the very open web that is dying. Other suggestions included social media platforms like TikTok, but these were met with resistance from users who want to keep those spaces ad-free.

Underlying the discussion was a sense of nostalgia for a more meritocratic web and a shared anxiety about the future of online discovery for small businesses. The consensus was that there is no clear, direct replacement for the function Google AdWords once served.

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 540 | **Comments:** 310 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red is selling GOG.com, its digital distribution platform, back to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The acquisition will make GOG a privately held company separate from CD Projekt. According to the official announcement, the move is a strategic decision for CD Projekt to focus exclusively on developing high-quality RPGs and entertainment based on its intellectual properties. For GOG, the sale is framed as a way to secure long-term backing that aligns with its core mission of providing DRM-free games and ensuring long-term ownership for customers. The platform emphasized that it is financially stable and had an "encouraging year."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was largely positive, with many users expressing relief and support for GOG's mission of DRM-free gaming and game preservation. Commenters view GOG as an "ethical oasis" in the tech industry and appreciate the ability to truly own their games rather than "lease" them via platforms like Steam.

However, there was significant skepticism regarding the official narrative of financial health. Several users pointed out that describing a year as "encouraging" is often corporate euphemism for struggling, suggesting the sale might be a move to stabilize the platform rather than purely a strategic pivot. This skepticism was bolstered by the context of CD Projekt's history with the turbulent launch of *Cyberpunk 2077*, with some fearing GOG could have been shut down as a cost-cutting measure if it remained under the parent company's shareholder pressure.

Technical discussions focused on the platform's future. A recurring request was the release of a native Linux client or better support for third-party tools like Heroic Games Launcher. While some users argued that GOG should focus on game acquisition and preservation rather than launcher development, others highlighted that tools like Lutris already fill that gap. There was also minor confusion and nostalgia regarding the evolution of the "GOG" acronym from "Good Old Games" to its current meaning of "freedom, independence, and genuine control."

## [Show HN: Z80-μLM, a 'Conversational AI' That Fits in 40KB](https://github.com/HarryR/z80ai)
**Score:** 474 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46417815

> **Project:** The project is a "Conversational AI" named Z80-μLM, designed to run on the Z80 microprocessor architecture. It is remarkably small, fitting entirely within a 40KB executable file (.com). The project demonstrates that a functional, albeit extremely limited, language model can be implemented on vintage 8-bit hardware, representing a significant feat of optimization and a novel application of AI principles in a constrained environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted with enthusiasm, primarily marveling at the technical achievement of fitting a language model into such a tiny footprint. Many commenters were inspired to think about practical applications, with the most popular idea being to run it on a Z80 simulator or on retro hardware like a Game Boy. The project's creator also appeared in the comments, noting they had initially considered a similar project (a browser-based CP/M emulator) but found this one too compelling not to share.

Several technical and conceptual points were raised:
*   **Nostalgia and Feasibility:** Users reminisced about the power constraints of old hardware, noting that while running such a model on a Game Boy would have been "magic," the battery drain would have been immense. Some felt its output might be less impressive than a classic ELIZA bot due to its terse nature.
*   **Data and Training:** A suggestion was made to use modern LLMs to generate the synthetic training data needed for such a small model, helping to avoid potential licensing or TOS issues.
*   **Security Implications:** One user posed an interesting question about whether a secret (like a passphrase) could be embedded in the model's weights and if it would be secure. This led to a discussion on machine learning interpretability and a reference to a paper on "undetectable backdoors" in ML models.
*   **Humor and Context:** The project was dubbed an "SLM" (Small Language Model) in contrast to today's LLMs, and its existence as a single .com file was found amusing. It was also described as "Eliza's granddaughter," placing it in the lineage of early conversational programs.

## [List of domains censored by German ISPs](https://cuiiliste.de/domains)
**Score:** 318 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46423566

> **Article:** The linked website, cuiiliste.de, provides a public list of domains censored by German Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The censorship is managed by CUII (Clearingstelle Urheberrecht im Internet), a private organization that compiles a list of websites accused of copyright infringement. Major ISPs like Deutsche Telekom voluntarily block access to these domains, primarily through DNS blocking. The list is dominated by pirate streaming and torrent sites, but also includes resources like Anna's Archive and Sci-Hub.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals that the censorship is not a government mandate but a voluntary, private-sector initiative by the film industry and ISPs. Users note that the blocks are easily circumvented by using alternative DNS providers like NextDNS or ControlD, or by using encrypted DNS (DoH/DoT), which is common among tech-savvy individuals. The conversation also touches on the broader context of German copyright enforcement, which is perceived as very strict, though commenters clarify that these specific blocks are civil copyright actions, not related to criminal matters like "hate speech" raids. There is some skepticism about the effectiveness of the blocks and a few users expressed interest in finding uncensored ISPs or accessing the blocked archives themselves.

## [Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain collapses as partner writes down deal by 99%](https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 309 | **ID:** 46423290

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that L&F, a key supplier for Tesla's 4680 battery cells, has written down its supply agreement with Tesla from $2.9 billion to just $7,386. This massive 99.999% reduction in value indicates a near-total collapse of the supply chain for this critical battery technology. The 4680 cell was previously touted by Elon Musk as the "holy grail" essential for producing a profitable $25,000 EV and achieving future growth. The write-down suggests that Tesla's production of the 4680 cells has either stalled or failed to meet expectations, casting serious doubt on the company's future vehicle plans and manufacturing capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of Tesla's current trajectory and valuation. The dominant theme is the perceived disconnect between Tesla's stock price and its operational reality. Commenters argue that the stock functions as a speculative asset or a "call option on Elon Musk," rather than a reflection of the company's declining sales in key markets (Europe, China) and failed product promises like the Cybertruck and 4680 battery.

The 4680 news is largely seen as confirmation of long-standing doubts about Tesla's technological claims, with one user noting that the battery was more marketing hype than a genuine breakthrough. Several comments point to what they see as fraudulent accounting, specifically citing reports that SpaceX and XAI are buying unsold Cybertrucks to artificially inflate Tesla's revenue. The discussion also touches on the "Musk partisan effect," with a study cited suggesting that the CEO's political activities have significantly harmed sales. While a few users express skepticism about the Electrek source, the prevailing sentiment is that Tesla is a "tulip future" facing a grim reality.

## [Show HN: Vibe coding a bookshelf with Claude Code](https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 192 | **ID:** 46420453

> **Project:** The project is a personal "bookshelf" web application created using a "vibe coding" approach with the Claude Code AI assistant. The author demonstrates how an AI tool can handle the execution and coding details, allowing the creator to focus on the high-level intent and design of the project. The result is a custom, locally-run web app that organizes and displays a personal book collection, tailored exactly to the user's preferences.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with commenters praising the project as an ideal use case for "vibe coding"—creating small, personal, and highly customized software without needing deep fluency in code. A key theme was the distinction between intent and execution, where the human provides the vision and taste, and the AI handles the implementation. This was seen as a major productivity booster for individuals or "user of 1" projects.

However, the discussion also introduced a critical perspective on the limitations of this approach. Commenters noted that as projects grow in size and complexity, the "vibe coding" method becomes unreliable. They argued that for larger applications, a more structured approach is necessary, where the developer must actively manage the AI's context, provide architectural guidance, and carefully review all generated code to prevent bugs and unnecessary abstractions. The conversation also touched on the nature of "taste," with some suggesting it's a key human advantage, while others argued it's not as unique as people think and could be replicated by AI.

## [You can't design software you don't work on](https://www.seangoedecke.com/you-cant-design-software-you-dont-work-on/)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 93 | **ID:** 46418415

> **Article:** The article argues that it's impossible to effectively design software for a system you are not actively working on. The author, Sean Goedecke, contrasts software engineering with structural engineering, where architects can design a building without laying bricks. In software, the "map is not the territory"; the abstract design documents or high-level plans rarely capture the complex, emergent realities of the existing codebase. These realities include hidden dependencies, legacy constraints, and subtle edge cases that only become apparent through the hands-on experience of implementation. Consequently, "generic" software design advice (like "just use microservices") is often useless or harmful because it ignores the specific context of the system. The author concludes that the most effective design decisions are made by developers who are deeply immersed in the code, as they are the only ones who truly understand the system's true nature.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis, with most commenters agreeing that hands-on coding experience is essential for good software design. A key theme is the distinction between high-level, generic advice and the specific, messy reality of an existing codebase. Many commenters, like skydhash, noted that while theoretical knowledge and "generic software design" are useful for establishing a shared vocabulary and general direction, they are no substitute for the deep, tacit knowledge that Naur's "Theory of Programming" describes as being held by the engineers who build the system.

The article's analogy to structural engineering was a major point of debate. While one commenter confirmed that construction engineering does separate design from implementation, others argued that software is fundamentally different because its "site conditions" are mutable and change rapidly. This leads to a discussion on whether software development is more of an art than a science, as it lacks the stable, established principles of other engineering disciplines.

A significant portion of the discussion centered on a detailed example of adding a "free sample" feature to an online retailer's checkout system. The original poster used this example to illustrate how a cascade of hidden, complex business rules makes upfront design nearly impossible. While another commenter countered that this complexity could be managed with good architectural patterns like separating policy from mechanism, the first poster maintained that the initial design would be flawed without prior knowledge of these rules.

Finally, the community debated the value of consistency versus "good design." One commenter argued that consistency is more important in large codebases, a point that resonated with others who had experienced the chaos of multiple, conflicting libraries or patterns within a single project. The discussion also touched on the benefits of having developers be active users of their own software, which creates a direct feedback loop and motivates higher quality work.

## [Staying ahead of censors in 2025](https://forum.torproject.org/t/staying-ahead-of-censors-in-2025-what-weve-learned-from-fighting-censorship-in-iran-and-russia/20898)
**Score:** 230 | **Comments:** 292 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** The article "Staying ahead of censors in 2025" from the Tor Project forum outlines the evolution of censorship resistance strategies. It argues that as censors use more sophisticated Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), simply obfuscating traffic is no longer sufficient. The new paradigm is "mimicry," where Tor traffic is designed to look exactly like legitimate, uncensored traffic. The article highlights two key technologies: **WebTunnel**, which mimics standard HTTPS traffic to a real-looking domain, and **Conjure**, which leverages unused IP address space at the ISP level to hide the initial handshake, making it impossible for censors to block a specific IP range without risking collateral damage to future legitimate services. The goal is to force censors into a dilemma where blocking Tor would also break the regular internet for their citizens.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes, moving from technical specifics to geopolitical and usability concerns.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the practical realities of censorship in different regions. Users inquiring about China detailed a sophisticated ecosystem of tools like V2Ray and Trojan, as well as paid services that use premium network routes (CN2 GIA) to bypass rate-limiting, suggesting that the cat-and-mouse game there is highly advanced. In contrast, a commenter with experience in Russia expressed skepticism that ISPs would cooperate with projects like Conjure, noting that Russian authorities show little concern for the collateral damage caused by broad IP blocks.

The discussion also took a sharp turn into the legal and ethical implications of providing censorship-circumvention tools to sanctioned nations. One user, facing a business dilemma with a sanctioned entity, asked if the Tor Project needs an OFAC license. The consensus in the replies was that distributing free, open-source software is an act of speech, not commerce, and therefore not subject to trade sanctions like OFAC.

Finally, several commenters pointed out omissions in the article. Some questioned the absence of China, speculating it was due to a lack of resources, while others were more critical, arguing that the article should also address censorship in Western democracies, such as the UK's "offensive communications" arrests and the EU's proposed "chat control" regulations. These commenters suggested that Tor's US government funding makes it politically difficult to list allied nations alongside adversaries like Russia and Iran. On a usability note, a user asked for simpler ways to change exit nodes to bypass geo-blocking, highlighting a gap between the project's advanced technical work and the end-user experience.

## [All Delisted Steam Games](https://delistedgames.com/all-delisted-steam-games/)
**Score:** 213 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46424262

> **Article:** The article on "All Delisted Steam Games" is a comprehensive list of video games that have been removed from the Steam store and are no longer available for purchase. It categorizes the reasons for delisting, which most commonly include expired licensing agreements (for music, cars, or franchise IP), the closure of a developer or publisher, and the release of a remastered or updated version of the game. The list serves as an archive for games that have disappeared from the digital marketplace.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the reasons for game delisting and the implications for game ownership and preservation.

A central theme is the problem of **licensing**. Multiple users point out that expired licenses for real-world brands (cars in *Blur* and *Project Gotham Racing*) or franchise IP (Warhammer's *Space Hulk*) are the most common reasons for delisting. This is seen as a major issue that harms consumers by making legally purchasing and playing older games impossible, with one user calling it "egregious." The conversation also touches on the trade-offs for developers using licensed IP versus building their own, using Larian's *Baldur's Gate 3* as an example.

Another key topic is **digital ownership and preservation**. Users confirm that even delisted games can typically be re-downloaded and played if they were previously purchased, which is seen as a small but important win for digital libraries. This is contrasted with the fear of future loss, with one user expressing concern that the Steam version of *Rocket League* might be disabled by its new owner, Epic Games.

Finally, the discussion briefly touches on other causes for delisting, such as **developer bankruptcy, server shutdowns for online games, and the replacement of a game with a definitive edition** (e.g., *Death Stranding* Director's Cut). There is also a minor tangent about the quality of specific games like *Space Hulk* and *Divinity: Original Sin 2*.

## [Libgodc: Write Go Programs for Sega Dreamcast](https://github.com/drpaneas/libgodc)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46420672

> **Article:** The article introduces "libgodc," a custom Go runtime for the Sega Dreamcast console. Created by drpaneas, it allows developers to write programs and games in Go for the 1999 hardware, which features a 200MHz SH4 CPU and 16MB of RAM. The project replaces the standard Go runtime with one tailored for the console's constraints, using `gccgo` for compilation. It integrates with the KallistiOS homebrew SDK and includes examples like Pong and Breakout, demonstrating that Go's features like goroutines and garbage collection can run on the classic system.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters frequently praising the project's documentation as exceptionally well-written and comprehensive, rivaling or exceeding that of major corporations. The technical feasibility was a key topic, with users discussing the use of `gccgo` and noting that while it works, it lacks support for newer features like generics. A notable tangent emerged where users compared the Dreamcast's 24MB of RAM to the resource usage of modern applications like Microsoft Teams, expressing frustration with current software bloat. The discussion also touched on alternative approaches for niche hardware, such as compiling to WebAssembly (WASM) and using TinyGo. Overall, the project was celebrated as an impressive technical achievement that evoked nostalgia for the Dreamcast era.

## [Linux DAW: Help Linux musicians to quickly and easily find the tools they need](https://linuxdaw.org/)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46419968

> **Article:** The article introduces "Linux DAW" (linuxdaw.org), a new web-based directory designed to help Linux musicians discover audio production tools. The site functions as a curated, filterable database of Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), plugins (synths, effects), and other relevant software. Key features include filters for license type (FOSS, commercial), specific audio functions (e.g., compression, synthesis), and compatibility, aiming to solve the problem of Linux audio software being difficult to discover due to fragmentation across various repositories and websites.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response was largely positive, with users praising the utility of a centralized, searchable directory for the fragmented Linux audio ecosystem. However, the discussion quickly branched into several technical and usability debates.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on hardware compatibility and user interface design. Users inquired about Raspberry Pi support, with others noting that ARM builds are scarce, though distributions like KxStudio offer a good starting point. A debate emerged regarding the skeuomorphic design of DAW interfaces; while one user argued that turning virtual knobs with a mouse is an inefficient interface, others countered that it provides consistency with physical MIDI controllers and is a compact way to display numerous parameters.

Several commenters challenged the article's underlying assumptions. One thread corrected the notion that telephony and professional audio streaming share similar requirements, arguing that audio production demands significantly lower latency and higher fidelity. Another user initially dismissed the site as an advertisement for expensive software, but was corrected that it lists both commercial and free tools, highlighting the strong preference for FOSS within the community.

Finally, users shared specific software recommendations and observations. Notable mentions included the KxStudio repository for Raspberry Pi, the Vital and Surge XT synths for their high-quality UIs, and the observation that FOSS plugins often lag in visual design compared to their commercial counterparts. There was also a minor thread about the "Linux musician" archetype, contrasting the open-source ethos with the Windows-based setups used by major artists like deadmau5.

## [Nvidia takes $5B stake in Intel under September agreement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/nvidia-takes-5-billion-stake-intel-under-september-agreement-2025-12-29/)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 93 | **ID:** 46423010

> **Article:** Reuters reports that Nvidia has acquired a $5 billion stake in Intel, as per an agreement made in September. This investment makes Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, holding approximately 4% of the company following a new share issuance. The move is a significant development in the semiconductor industry, linking the two dominant players in GPUs and CPUs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the Nvidia-Intel deal is largely skeptical and cynical, focusing on the broader economic implications and the specific challenges facing Intel.

Commenters questioned the accuracy of the reported 4% stake and corrected the list of Intel's top shareholders, noting that institutional investors and the U.S. government hold larger positions. The feasibility of a potential full acquisition of Intel by Nvidia was quickly dismissed due to certain antitrust hurdles, with users pointing to the failed ARM acquisition as a precedent.

The core of the debate centered on whether money can solve Intel's deep-seated problems. Many argued that Intel's issues are fundamental, requiring specialized manufacturing expertise ("wizards") that cannot be simply bought, especially as that talent is concentrated in Taiwan.

Economically, the deal was viewed by some as a symptom of a "circular" flow of capital, where large companies invest in each other due to a lack of other productive places to put their money. This led to a broader discussion about market dynamics, with some commenters predicting a future "brutal" correction for Nvidia's high margins. The general sentiment was one of dark humor and skepticism, viewing the investment as a strategic move to neutralize a potential competitor rather than a genuine partnership.

## [Swapping SIM cards used to be easy, and then came eSIM](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 238 | **ID:** 46421653

> **Article:** The article, "I switched to eSIM in 2025 and I am full of regret," argues that the industry-wide shift from physical SIM cards to eSIMs is a significant loss for consumer freedom and convenience. The author contends that eSIMs are a "big tech" imposition designed to lock users into carrier-controlled ecosystems. The primary issues highlighted are the difficulty and unreliability of transferring eSIMs between devices, especially outside of the standard upgrade cycle (e.g., moving to a loaner phone or replacing a damaged device). The author describes a frustrating experience trying to activate a new eSIM, which required multiple failed attempts and a store visit, contrasting this with the simple, user-controlled process of physically swapping a SIM card. The article frames the loss of the physical SIM slot alongside the removal of headphone jacks and microSD card slots as another erosion of user rights and choice.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is sharply divided, with users sharing starkly contrasting experiences that often depend on the specific scenario.

Negative experiences with eSIMs tend to revolve around edge cases and a loss of user autonomy. Commenters report difficulties activating eSIMs on new devices, especially when their primary phone has no data connection. A key concern is the loss of freedom: eSIMs are seen as a carrier-locked technology that prevents easy device switching and can be used to enforce subsidized phone contracts. Users also noted issues with carrier compatibility for non-local phones while traveling and the inability to transfer eSIMs from services like Airalo between devices.

Conversely, many users praised eSIMs for their convenience in common, well-supported workflows. The standard upgrade path between iPhones is described as seamless and automatic. For international travel, the ability to instantly download and activate a local data plan without visiting a store or swapping physical cards is considered a "fantastic" and "painless" advantage. This experience is often contrasted with the minor inconvenience of finding a SIM ejector tool.

Underlying the debate is a broader theme of consumer choice. Some users advocate for "voting with their wallet" by choosing phones that retain features like physical SIM slots and headphone jacks, resisting the industry's push for a more restrictive, integrated ecosystem.

## [LLMs Are Not Fun](https://orib.dev/nofun.html)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46424136

> **Article:** The article "LLMs Are Not Fun" argues that the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in programming is stripping the joy and meaning from the profession. The author contends that the true satisfaction of programming comes from deep problem-solving, understanding complex systems, and the personal growth that comes from overcoming challenges. They argue that LLMs short-circuit this process, turning coding from a craft into a mere act of "prompt engineering" and code review. This shift, they fear, devalues the human element of creation and reduces developers to "managers" of AI-generated code, ultimately making the job less fulfilling and more like tedious oversight.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with many users directly contradicting the article's premise. A significant portion of commenters find LLMs to be a source of *more* fun, not less. They argue that by automating tedious tasks like boilerplate, looking up APIs, and fixing minor errors, LLMs free them to focus on the enjoyable aspects of development: high-level design, architecture, and creative problem-solving. This group sees LLMs as a powerful tool that amplifies their ability to bring ideas to life quickly.

However, a counter-argument, echoing the article's sentiment, values the process of creation itself. These users feel that the struggle and deep immersion in a problem are integral to the joy of programming, and outsourcing this to an AI makes the work feel hollow.

A prominent theme is the social pressure surrounding AI adoption. Several commenters praised the original article for its "bravery" in expressing a dissenting opinion in an environment where developers are often expected to enthusiastically embrace AI tools. They note a perceived pressure to not only use but also *enjoy* using LLMs to remain relevant. Finally, some users offered a middle ground, suggesting the key is using LLMs for the "tedious bits" while retaining human control over the core logic and creative direction, and that the fun is derived from the end result rather than the process itself.

## [Huge Binaries](https://fzakaria.com/2025/12/28/huge-binaries)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46417791

> **Article:** The article "Huge Binaries" by Farid Zakaria discusses the problem of extremely large binaries (25GiB+) encountered at large tech companies. The primary cause is not the executable code itself, but the inclusion of massive debug symbols. These symbols contain detailed type information, template instantiations, and local variable data, especially for C++.

To accommodate binaries larger than 2GiB, developers must switch from the default "small" code model to the "large" code model. This change has a significant performance cost: it forces the compiler to use 64-bit absolute addresses for function calls instead of efficient 32-bit relative offsets, increasing code size and putting pressure on CPU registers. The author presents this as a real-world engineering trade-off between deployment simplicity (single static binary) and performance/efficiency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on whether 25GiB binaries are an unavoidable consequence of scale or a sign of a deeper architectural problem.

A key theme was the debate over the root cause. Many commenters, including ex-Googlers, argued that while debug symbols explain the file size, the sheer amount of executable code (even 2GB) is a "code smell." They suggested that such a monolith should be broken into multiple applications or that developers should accept deploying a collection of files (like a tarball or container image) rather than insisting on a single executable. The counter-argument was that for companies like Google, the trade-off for faster startup times and simplified deployment might be worth the engineering cost.

There was also a strong focus on build toolchains. Commenters noted that the problem could be mitigated by using Link-Time Optimization (LTO) and garbage collection of unused code sections to trim the executable size. They also discussed technical solutions like using compiler "thunks" or tools like Facebook's BOLT to manage the large code model's performance penalties. The consensus was that while the problem is real, it stems from specific, high-stakes engineering choices rather than a universal necessity.

## [Feynman's Hughes Lectures: 950 pages of notes](https://thehugheslectures.info/the-lectures/)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46419273

> **Article:** The article links to a website hosting a 950-page set of notes from Richard Feynman's 1983-1984 Hughes Lectures. These are distinct from the famous Caltech "Feynman Lectures on Physics." The notes were meticulously transcribed from the lectures by an individual, covering a different set of topics and representing a significant archival effort.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is split between admiration for the find and a critique of the "Feynman cult of personality." One commenter sparked a debate by questioning Feynman's enduring popularity, suggesting that other seminal works like Purcell's textbook on electromagnetism are more deserving of recognition but lack the same cultural cachet. Others countered that Feynman's charisma and public profile naturally give his lectures a broader appeal than dense academic textbooks.

The majority of the thread, however, expressed awe at the sheer productivity and artistry on display. Commenters marveled at the 950 pages of handwritten notes, admiring the neat capital letters and detailed drawings as "pieces of renaissance art." There was also some discussion regarding the context of the notes, with a user clarifying that these are not the original Caltech lectures and providing a link to those, while others lamented that the modern "publish or perish" academic environment makes such deep, dedicated lecture preparation a rarity.

## [Static Allocation with Zig](https://nickmonad.blog/2025/static-allocation-with-zig-kv/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46422009

> **Article:** The article "Static Allocation with Zig" describes a proof-of-concept key-value store written in Zig that adheres to a strict memory allocation strategy: all memory is pre-allocated at startup, and no dynamic memory allocation (or freeing) occurs during runtime. This approach, inspired by the "TigerStyle" guide from the TigerBeetle database project, aims to achieve predictable performance, eliminate runtime allocation overhead, and prevent entire classes of memory bugs like use-after-free. The author demonstrates how Zig's generic allocator interface makes this pattern idiomatic and easy to implement by passing an allocator to components at initialization.
