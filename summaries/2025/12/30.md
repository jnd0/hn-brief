# Hacker News Summary - 2025-12-30

## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 895 | **Comments:** 819 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" recounts a frustrating travel experience with Germany's national railway. The author's train was severely delayed and rerouted due to a problem on the line. Instead of stopping at the author's intended destination, the train bypassed it and continued to a much farther city. The author claims that staff refused to let passengers off at the bypassed station because it was not on the official, updated itinerary, effectively "kidnapping" them and forcing them to travel 60km past their stop. The piece criticizes the rigid bureaucracy, poor communication, and lack of flexibility within the Deutsche Bahn (DB) system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a widespread consensus that Deutsche Bahn (DB) is a source of frequent frustration, but opinions diverge on the root causes and how it compares to other systems.

Many commenters, particularly those with experience in the UK, engage in a "misery Olympics," comparing the failures of different national railways. While some argue the UK is worse due to its "extortionate" pricing and airline-style fares, others point out that DB's reliability has degraded significantly, making delays of an hour or more a common expectation. A key point of contrast is the UK's "Delay Repay" system, which provides automatic compensation for delays, a feature many feel DB lacks.

The discussion highlights a perceived culture of inflexibility and poor customer service at DB. Commenters share similar stories of being rerouted to unintended destinations, receiving no help from staff (especially for non-German speakers), and facing bureaucratic hurdles that prioritize rules over passenger convenience. This is contrasted with some positive experiences in other European countries like Denmark and Spain, though other users counter that Italy's system is also dysfunctional.

A significant debate emerges around the author's use of the word "kidnapped." One commenter, living in Germany, dismisses the article as "whining," arguing that Germans have an unrealistic intolerance for unforeseen events (like accidents or mechanical failures) and that DB is still far superior to US or UK systems. This view is strongly rebutted by others who insist the problem is not the initial delay but the subsequent bureaucratic failure to handle the situation logically, such as refusing to let passengers off at a scheduled stop simply because the train's official route had changed.

## [You can make up HTML tags](https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/)
**Score:** 524 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46416945

> **Article:** The article "You can make up HTML tags" explains that modern browsers will render non-standard, custom HTML tags (e.g., `<my-custom-tag>`) without errors. By default, these unknown elements behave like inline `<span>` elements but can be fully styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript just like standard elements. The author presents this as a simple, powerful feature for creating more semantic and readable markup, especially for smaller projects where a full JavaScript framework might be overkill. The article also touches on the more advanced Custom Elements API, which allows developers to define specific behaviors and properties for these tags, effectively creating reusable components.

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 492 | **Comments:** 276 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red, the parent company of the digital game store GOG, is selling GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The acquisition will make GOG a privately held company separate from CD Projekt. According to the official announcement, this move aligns with CD Projekt's strategy to focus exclusively on developing high-quality RPGs and entertainment based on their intellectual properties. For GOG, the acquisition is framed as a way to secure long-term backing from a founder who shares the platform's core values of DRM-free gaming, user control, and game preservation. GOG has stated that the platform is financially stable and that the change will allow them to accelerate their unique mission.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the news, viewing the acquisition as a positive step for GOG's long-term health and its mission of ethical, DRM-free game distribution. The prevailing sentiment is that GOG is a valuable "oasis" in the tech industry, and this move protects it from the pressures of being a subsidiary of a publicly traded company focused on blockbuster hits.

Key discussion points included:
*   **Strategic Sense:** Users agreed that the split benefits both parties: CD Projekt can focus on game development (and avoid the risk of having to shut down GOG after a potential future game flop), while GOG gains an owner dedicated to its unique, pro-consumer values.
*   **Financial Interpretation:** There was a debate over GOG's financial health. While the official announcement described the past year as "encouraging," some users were skeptical, suggesting this is corporate language for a company that isn't performing well and needs a turnaround. Others countered that GOG's recent success with retro gaming events suggests genuine growth.
*   **DRM and Ownership:** A recurring theme was the importance of true game ownership, with many commenters contrasting GOG's DRM-free model favorably against Steam's "leasing" model. This was cited as a primary reason for supporting GOG despite minor inconveniences.
*   **Feature Requests:** Several users expressed a desire for GOG to improve its platform, with the most common requests being an official Linux client and better remote play features.
*   **Historical Context:** Commenters clarified the acquisition's backstory, including the fact that GOG was originally founded by Kiciński, and discussed the company's evolution from "Good Old Games" to just "GOG."

## [Google is dead. Where do we go now?](https://www.circusscientist.com/2025/12/29/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/)
**Score:** 376 | **Comments:** 358 | **ID:** 46425198

> **Article:** The article, written by the operator of a small entertainment agency in South Africa, laments the decline of Google AdWords as an effective marketing tool. The author claims that while AdWords was once a reliable source of leads, it has become ineffective and prohibitively expensive. They argue that the platform is now flooded with low-quality clicks, potential bots, and inflated costs, making it unsustainable for small businesses. The post is a plea for advice, asking fellow small business owners where they should turn for marketing now that "Google is dead" for them.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion revolves around three main themes: the validity of the article's premise, the broader context of the changing internet, and potential alternatives.

Many commenters validate the author's experience, sharing their own negative memories of AdWords, such as high costs and suspicions of click fraud. There's a sentiment that the system was a "scam" that favored businesses with the most money to spend. However, others push back on the "Google is dead" headline, pointing out the company's continued financial success and clarifying that the article is specifically about the decline of its advertising platform, not the company itself.

A broader debate emerges about the cause of this decline. Several users connect it to the rise of AI and social media, which are "killing the open web" that search engines rely on. Anecdotal evidence supports this, with one user noting their group is now finding travel recommendations entirely through social media apps instead of search engines. This leads to a philosophical discussion on the lifecycle of technology, with one user arguing that "cool" things inevitably become "uncool" and are replaced, framing this as a natural progression rather than a tragedy.

Finally, the conversation turns to solutions. Kagi is suggested as a modern search alternative, but it's immediately questioned whether it can survive if the open web it crawls continues to wither. The author of the original post engages in the comments, clarifying their specific situation (a small local business) and dismissing click fraud as a primary cause. Other commenters suggest exploring alternative ad platforms like TikTok, though the author expresses a preference for the "honesty" of search-based ads over algorithm-driven ones.

## [Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain collapses as partner writes down deal by 99%](https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 291 | **ID:** 46423290

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that a key partner in Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain, L&F, has written down its supply agreement with Tesla from a value of $2.9 billion to just $7,386. This massive 99.999% reduction indicates a near-total collapse of the original deal, suggesting that Tesla's production and demand for the 4680 cells have failed to materialize as planned. The 4680 battery was previously touted as a revolutionary "holy grail" technology that would enable a low-cost $25,000 EV, but this development points to significant manufacturing and strategic failures.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of Tesla's current trajectory and valuation. The dominant theme is the perceived disconnect between Tesla's stock price and its operational reality. One commenter describes TSLA as a "call option on Musk succeeding" rather than a reflection of the company's performance, while another compares its valuation to a "tulip future," suggesting a speculative bubble.

Several users point to a pattern of unfulfilled promises and declining performance, citing the 4680 battery issues alongside delayed products like the Roadster and Robotaxi, as well as falling sales in key markets like Europe and the US. The idea that Tesla's stock is being propped up by circular financial arrangements, such as SpaceX purchasing unsold Cybertrucks, is also raised as a form of "quasi fraud."

However, there is a notable counterpoint questioning the credibility of the source article (Electrek) and suggesting the battery program might simply be undergoing a strategic pivot rather than a total collapse. On the technical side, commenters downplayed the 4680's uniqueness, calling it a "boring" mature technology with a flawed chemistry that failed to deliver on its marketing hype. The discussion concludes with a broader sense of frustration, linking Tesla's struggles to a grim outlook for the entire EV industry's future.

## [List of domains censored by German ISPs](https://cuiiliste.de/domains)
**Score:** 261 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46423566

> **Article:** The linked website, cuiiliste.de, provides a public list of domains blocked by German Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The list is maintained by CUII (Coordination Unit for Internet Blocking), a private organization that identifies websites, primarily those involved in copyright infringement and illegal streaming, and provides the list to ISPs who voluntarily choose to block them. The blocks are typically implemented at the DNS level.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals that the CUII list is largely composed of pirate streaming and torrent sites, rather than malware or other security threats. Users noted that the blocks are not legally mandated and are DNS-based, making them easy to circumvent by using alternative DNS providers like NextDNS or ControlD, or by using DNS-over-HTTPS. This led to a debate on the effectiveness of such measures and the motivations behind them. Several commenters suggested the list is more a product of film industry lobbying than a genuine effort to protect users. The conversation also touched on broader German attitudes towards copyright enforcement, with some users contrasting it with the country's approach to other legal issues. There was also a mention of a related talk at the upcoming Chaos Communication Congress (39c3) and a discussion about Anna's Archive, which was also on the list.

## [Show HN: Vibe coding a bookshelf with Claude Code](https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/)
**Score:** 250 | **Comments:** 188 | **ID:** 46420453

> **Project:** The project is a personal bookshelf web application created using "vibe coding" with the assistance of Claude Code. The author demonstrates how an AI tool can handle the execution and coding details, allowing the creator to focus on the high-level intent and design. The result is a functional, visually appealing, and personalized piece of software that works exactly as the user desires, highlighting the power of AI as a tool for rapid development of personal projects.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response is largely positive, with commenters celebrating the project as an ideal use case for "vibe coding"—using AI to handle execution while the human provides intent and taste. Several users shared personal anecdotes about how tools like Claude Code have enabled them to build personal software and bridge the gap between architectural knowledge and practical coding fluency.

The discussion also touched on the practical limits of this approach. A key point was that vibe coding is best suited for smaller, self-contained projects. For larger, more complex applications, commenters suggested a more disciplined approach: using the AI as a powerful pair-programmer that requires careful context management and code review, rather than letting it generate code unchecked. The conversation also briefly explored the nature of "taste," with some arguing it's the last bastion of human contribution, while others believe it can be learned and replicated by AI. The project also evoked nostalgia for Delicious Library, an early 2000s Mac app for cataloging personal collections.

## [Staying ahead of censors in 2025](https://forum.torproject.org/t/staying-ahead-of-censors-in-2025-what-weve-learned-from-fighting-censorship-in-iran-and-russia/20898)
**Score:** 228 | **Comments:** 285 | **ID:** 46417844

> **Article:** The article from the Tor Project forum, "Staying ahead of censors in 2025," details the evolution of censorship resistance strategies. It argues that as censors use more sophisticated Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), simple traffic obfuscation (making traffic look random) is no longer sufficient. The new paradigm is "mimicry," where circumvention tools disguise their traffic to look identical to common, uncensored protocols like standard HTTPS. The article highlights two key technologies: **WebTunnel**, which mimics a standard secure website connection, and **Conjure**, which leverages unused IP address space at the ISP level to hide the initial handshake, making it nearly impossible for censors to block without causing significant collateral damage to legitimate internet traffic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes, moving from technical specifics to geopolitical and legal considerations.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the practical realities of censorship in specific countries. Users asking about China received detailed answers about the thriving ecosystem of non-Tor tools like V2Ray and Trojan, as well as the economic factors involved, such as paying for premium network routes (CN2 GIA) to avoid throttling and poor peering. Similarly, a discussion on the feasibility of the "Conjure" technique in Russia concluded that while technically sound, its success depends on ISP cooperation, which is unlikely in a state-controlled environment. One user provided a stark anecdote, noting that Russian censors already cause massive collateral damage by blocking entire IP ranges, suggesting they wouldn't hesitate to block unused address space.

The legal and ethical implications of providing censorship tools to sanctioned nations sparked a heated debate. One user, facing their own OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) licensing dilemma, questioned if Tor needs a license to operate in countries like Iran and Russia. This led to a strong rebuttal from other commenters, who argued that distributing free, open-source software is an act of speech, not commerce or trade, and is therefore not subject to trade sanctions like OFAC. The discussion was further colored by skepticism about Tor's funding from the US government, with some users suggesting this relationship prevents Tor from acknowledging censorship issues in allied countries like the UK.

Finally, some users brought up broader topics. They questioned the absence of any mention of "chat control" or "age verification" laws in the EU and UK, which some see as forms of censorship. The response was that Tor's focus is on technical solutions to network blocking, not political or legal advocacy. Other comments included a request for better user-friendliness in changing exit nodes to bypass geo-blocking and a desire for native DNS tunneling support within Tor.

## [You can't design software you don't work on](https://www.seangoedecke.com/you-cant-design-software-you-dont-work-on/)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46418415

> **Article:** The article argues that it is impossible to effectively design software for a system you are not actively working on. The author contrasts "generic software design" (high-level principles, patterns, and architecture) with the reality of implementation. While generic advice is useful for setting direction, the true complexity of a system lies in the specific details and constraints that only become apparent during coding. The author uses an analogy with structural engineering, noting that while civil engineers don't lay bricks, the physical laws of reality are constant, unlike the constantly shifting logic of software. The article concludes that the most valuable design decisions emerge from the implementation process itself, making it impossible for a detached architect to foresee all necessary trade-offs.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise but offers significant nuance and counter-arguments. A central theme is the tension between high-level planning and ground-level implementation, with many commenters sharing the "tree swing cartoon" analogy to illustrate how requirements are often lost in translation between management and developers. The "Amazon free samples" example from the article was a major point of discussion; some saw it as proof that upfront design is impossible, while others argued it was a failure of system decomposition and that a well-architected system would handle such complexity through configuration and separation of concerns.

There was a notable debate on whether software engineering is a true engineering discipline. One commenter argued that the lack of established, unchanging principles suggests software is more of an "art," while another countered that large-scale, repeatable experience allows for effective upfront architectural design, even if it's not a new system. The value of consistency was also debated, with some warning that enforcing consistency on a flawed existing system can be worse than allowing "cowboy" developers to implement better solutions, leading to a fragmented codebase.

Ultimately, the consensus leaned towards the article's view, particularly regarding adding features to existing systems. The most practical approach highlighted was that designers must have deep, hands-on experience with the codebase to make sound architectural decisions, and that the best designs are often discovered iteratively rather than planned perfectly from the start.

## [Rich Hickey: Thanks AI](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/ea94e3741ff0a4e3af55b9fe6287887f)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46415945

> **Article:** The linked content is a short, sarcastic note from renowned software engineer Rich Hickey, author of Clojure. Addressed to an AI, the note "thanks" the model for demonstrating the validity of his long-held critiques of the software industry. Hickey argues that AI-generated code perfectly embodies the problems he has warned against for years: prioritizing superficial "ease" over genuine "simplicity," creating incomprehensible complexity, and discouraging deep thought ("hammock time") in favor of rapid, thoughtless output. The piece is a sharp, ironic critique suggesting that AI is not a new problem, but rather the ultimate manifestation of old, bad habits in software development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the validity of Hickey's critique, the ethics of AI, and the nature of the technology itself. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes.

A significant portion of the comments strongly agree with Hickey, viewing the rise of AI-generated content as a flood of "slop" and "bait." They see the AI's "thank you" note as a particularly glib and disingenuous marketing tactic, an attempt to feign respect for human creators while profiting from their work without compensation. This camp expresses deep concern about the degradation of quality and thought in software and society.

In direct opposition, other users dismiss the critique as hypocritical, cynical, or simply a "get off my lawn" moment from established figures. They argue that these luminaries are bandwagoning on anti-AI sentiment and that the technology is merely a tool, with the blame lying with the corporations and regulations that incentivize its misuse. Some even challenge Hickey's own past work in fintech as having "skin in the game" that undermines his moral stance.

A more nuanced perspective emerges from comments that contextualize the debate. One user suggests that AI coding tools are effective precisely because much professional programming has become repetitive and unimaginative, and AI is simply automating that "slop." This leads to a debate on whether human-generated slop is any better than AI-generated slop. Another user points out that the core issue is the automation of thought itself, contrasting Hickey's philosophy of deliberate design with the "code-first, think-later" approach of coding agents. The discussion also touches on the practical reality that people and corporations, not AI, are the ones choosing to deploy these tools, shifting the focus of responsibility.

## [Libgodc: Write Go Programs for Sega Dreamcast](https://github.com/drpaneas/libgodc)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46420672

> **Article:** The article introduces "libgodc," a custom Go runtime for the Sega Dreamcast console. Created by drpaneas, this project allows developers to write programs in Go for the 1999 hardware, utilizing features like goroutines, channels, and garbage collection on the Dreamcast's 200MHz SH4 CPU and 16MB of RAM. The runtime replaces the standard Go scheduler and memory management with a lightweight version compatible with the hardware. It compiles using a specific version of GCC (gccgo) and integrates with the KallistiOS homebrew SDK. The project includes documentation, video tutorials, and several game examples (Pong, Breakout, Platformer) to demonstrate its capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with strong admiration for the project, primarily focusing on the exceptional quality of the documentation, which many users compared favorably to professional corporate standards. The technical discussion revolved around the feasibility of using Go on such constrained hardware (16MB RAM), with the creator explaining the use of `gccgo` and noting that modern features like generics are currently missing from the toolchain. A notable tangent emerged where users compared the Dreamcast's specs to modern software bloat, specifically critiquing Microsoft Teams' performance. Additionally, the conversation briefly touched on alternative methods for running Go on niche hardware, such as compiling to WASI/Wasm, though the consensus remained that a direct bare-metal port is a significant technical achievement.

## [LLMs Are Not Fun](https://orib.dev/nofun.html)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46424136

> **Article:** The article "LLMs Are Not Fun" argues that the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in programming is stripping the craft of its joy and meaning. The author contends that the true satisfaction in software development comes from deep, cognitive engagement: fully understanding a problem, tracing the ripples of a change through a system, and the intellectual mastery required to build something robust. They posit that LLMs encourage a superficial, "vibe-based" approach, replacing this deep understanding with a transactional, "magical" process that yields code one doesn't fully comprehend. This shift, the author fears, transforms the developer from a creator into a mere reviewer or "manager" of AI-generated code, leading to a sense of alienation and a loss of professional identity and pride.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep ideological split on the role of LLMs in programming, centered on the very definition of a developer's "craft." Many commenters strongly disagree with the article, arguing that LLMs enhance, rather than diminish, their enjoyment and productivity. They see LLMs as a tool that automates the tedious and frustrating parts of development—such as boilerplate, syntax errors, and API lookups—freeing them to focus on the more engaging aspects like high-level design, architecture, and creative problem-solving. For this group, the "fun" comes from the end result and the ability to rapidly bring ideas to life, not from the act of typing out code line by line.

Conversely, a significant faction aligns with the author's perspective, expressing concern that outsourcing the "thinking" to an AI erodes the deep understanding and sense of ownership that gives the work meaning. They worry that this creates a generation of developers who can't debug or maintain complex systems they didn't build themselves.

A unique and widely appreciated angle was the discussion around social pressure. Several users praised the author's "bravery" in publishing a dissenting opinion in a climate where enthusiasm for AI tools is often treated as a prerequisite for being a relevant developer. This highlights a meta-commentary on the "hype cycle" and the perceived pressure to perform enthusiasm for new technologies. Ultimately, the debate crystallized into a philosophical question about whether the value of programming lies in the creative process itself or in the efficient production of a working result.

## [Huge Binaries](https://fzakaria.com/2025/12/28/huge-binaries)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46417791

> **Article:** The article "Huge Binaries" by Farid Zakaria discusses the problem of creating extremely large (25GiB+) statically linked C++ binaries, a practice common at large tech companies like Google and Facebook. The primary motivation is to achieve faster startup times and simplify deployment by creating self-contained executables. The technical bottleneck is the x86-64 architecture's 2GiB limit for the `.text` section, which uses 32-bit relative addressing for calls and jumps. When this limit is exceeded, the linker must switch to the "large code model," which uses slower, absolute addressing. The author explores strategies to avoid this, such as linker optimizations and reordering code to keep hot paths within the 2GiB boundary, and mentions that debug symbols are a major contributor to the binary size but are stored in separate ELF sections.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is centered on the trade-offs and underlying causes of massive binaries. A key theme is the debate over whether such a practice is a necessary optimization or a "code smell." Many commenters express horror at the 25GiB figure, arguing that it indicates a monolithic design and that the engineering effort should focus on modularization or better build processes (like Link-Time Optimization) rather than scaling infrastructure to handle the bloat. However, others defend the practice, noting that for companies at extreme scale, even a minor performance gain in startup time can translate to significant cost savings. The discussion also delves into technical details, clarifying that debug symbols are the main cause of the 25GiB size, while the 2GiB `.text` limit is the core technical constraint. The conversation concludes with mentions of advanced solutions like Facebook's BOLT and Google's post-link optimizers, which are designed to manage and optimize these massive binaries.

## [Nvidia takes $5B stake in Intel under September agreement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/nvidia-takes-5-billion-stake-intel-under-september-agreement-2025-12-29/)
**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46423010

> **Article:** Reuters reports that Nvidia has acquired a $5 billion stake in Intel, based on an agreement from September. This investment makes Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, giving it a roughly 4% ownership of the company following the issuance of new shares. The move marks a significant development in the semiconductor industry, linking the two dominant players in the AI accelerator and CPU markets, respectively.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Nvidia's investment in Intel is characterized by skepticism, analysis of corporate structure, and broader economic concerns.

A central theme is the belief that money alone cannot solve Intel's deep-seated problems. Commenters argue that Intel's primary challenge is a lack of manufacturing expertise ("wizards") in advanced processes like EUV lithography, which cannot be easily acquired. The idea that Nvidia could or should buy Intel outright is dismissed, with users pointing to insurmountable antitrust hurdles in the US, UK, and EU that previously blocked Nvidia's acquisition of ARM.

There is also a debate over the accuracy of shareholder rankings. While the original post suggested Nvidia would be a top shareholder alongside the US government and SoftBank, other users clarified that major institutional investors like BlackRock and Vanguard still hold larger stakes than Nvidia.

Broader economic commentary emerged, with some users describing the flow of capital between large corporations as a "circular economy" or a symptom of a lack of productive places to invest capital. One commenter linked this to Michael Burry's warnings about capital amortization in the AI build-out, suggesting Nvidia's high margins are unsustainable and that the industry is hitting fundamental physical limits (e.g., power, cooling, and the end of Moore's Law).

Finally, some users debated the corporate structure of ownership itself, questioning whether it's beneficial for companies to own large stakes in other companies, while others defended the model as a necessary tool for limiting liability.

## [Swapping SIM cards used to be easy, and then came eSIM](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 212 | **ID:** 46421653

> **Article:** The article, titled "I switched to eSIM in 2025 and I am full of regret," argues that the industry-wide shift from physical SIM cards to eSIMs is a significant loss for consumer freedom. The author details a frustrating personal experience where an eSIM transfer between iPhones failed, requiring a lengthy and difficult support call to resolve. The piece contends that eSIMs are not a technological upgrade for users but a move that benefits carriers and manufacturers by locking consumers into their ecosystems. It frames the removal of the physical SIM slot as another step in the trend of eliminating user-repairable and transferable components, like headphone jacks and microSD cards, ultimately reducing user control over their devices and services.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is sharply divided, reflecting a "your mileage may vary" reality with eSIM technology. The conversation can be broken down into three main themes: the negative experiences, the positive experiences, and the underlying systemic issues.

Many users shared the author's frustration, citing difficulties with carrier support, failed activations, and the inability to easily transfer an eSIM to a new device without an internet connection or carrier approval. A key concern raised is that eSIMs are designed to restrict user freedom, making it harder to switch devices or carriers and giving providers more control over the "secure element." This is seen as a move to secure business models rather than improve user experience.

Conversely, a significant number of commenters reported seamless and even superior experiences. For these users, eSIMs made upgrading between new iPhones effortless, with the transfer handled automatically during device setup. The technology was also praised as a major convenience for international travelers, allowing them to instantly purchase and activate local data plans without needing to find a physical SIM card vendor.

A third group of comments focused on the technical and business nuances. Some argued that the problems lie with poor carrier implementation or specific business models (like subsidized phones) rather than the eSIM technology itself. Others pointed out that while manufacturers are removing physical SIM slots, some brands (like Sony) still cater to users who want them. A few technically-minded users also noted the potential for open-source eSIM management, suggesting the technology itself isn't inherently restrictive, even if current implementations are.

## [Show HN: My not-for-profit search engine with no ads, no AI, & all DDG bangs](https://nilch.org)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46417748

> **Project:** The project, "nilch," is a not-for-profit search engine frontend created by a Hacker News user. It is positioned as a minimalist, privacy-focused alternative with no ads and no AI. Its core feature is full support for all DuckDuckGo (DDG) bangs, allowing users to instantly redirect searches to other services (e.g., `!w` for Wikipedia, `!gh` for GitHub). Currently, the project is a "thin wrapper" that uses the Brave Search API to fetch results, rather than a fully independent search engine with its own index and ranking algorithm.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded with a mix of encouragement, practical advice, and philosophical debate. The creator (UnmappedStack) was highly engaged, responding to feedback and bug reports in real-time.

Key discussion points included:

*   **Technical Feasibility and Future Development:** Several users pointed out that nilch is currently just a frontend for Brave Search. While the creator acknowledged this and expressed a desire to build a custom index and ranking algorithm in the future, they noted the significant financial and resource barriers. Suggestions included using existing open-source search indices like MarginaliaSearch.

*   **Sustainability and Business Model:** A major theme was the project's long-term viability. Users expressed concern about the API costs for the creator and suggested partnerships (e.g., with Ecosia) or donations. This sparked a broader debate on the role of profit in free-software projects. One user argued that profitability is essential for sustainability and preventing developer burnout, while others countered that profit-seeking, especially through advertising, is inherently corrosive to user privacy and trust.

*   **Feature Requests and Bug Reports:** The discussion quickly surfaced technical issues, including a bug where the site would error or refresh infinitely (which the creator traced to exhausted API credits) and problems with handling quoted search strings. Feature requests included adding custom DDG bangs, implementing search autocomplete, and supporting DDG's "bang in the middle" and "bang-only" redirect syntax.

*   **Openness vs. Security:** A user argued that making a search ranking algorithm open-source is a bad idea because it gives spammers a "recipe" to game the results. This led to a counter-discussion about the need for user-selectable and transparent algorithms, drawing parallels to issues in social media.

*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Users compared nilch to SearxNG (another privacy-respecting meta-search engine), with the creator clarifying that nilch's goal is greater simplicity and minimalism.

## [Linux DAW: Help Linux musicians to quickly and easily find the tools they need](https://linuxdaw.org/)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46419968

> **Article:** The article introduces "Linux DAW" (linuxdaw.org), a new web-based directory designed to help Linux musicians find audio production tools like Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), plugins, and utilities. The site aims to solve the problem of discoverability in the fragmented Linux audio ecosystem by providing a searchable, filterable database where users can sort by license type (e.g., FOSS, commercial), functionality (e.g., synth, compressor), and other attributes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response was largely positive, with users praising the site for solving the significant problem of discoverability in the Linux audio world. Many expressed excitement about the filtering capabilities, which make it easier to find specific types of tools among the many available options.

However, the discussion quickly branched out into several technical and philosophical debates:
*   **Platform Support (Raspberry Pi):** A top comment asked about support for the Raspberry Pi, leading to a discussion about the challenges of ARM builds. Users noted that while options are limited, distributions like KXStudio offer a good starting point for Pi-based audio.
*   **UI/UX Skeuomorphism:** A debate emerged about the "skeuomorphic" design of many audio plugins, specifically the common "turning a knob with a mouse" interface. While some argued this is a poor user experience, others defended it as a compact and familiar way to interact, especially for users with physical MIDI controllers.
*   **Linux Audio vs. Telephony:** One user drew a comparison between the low-latency audio streaming needs of musicians and telephony. This was quickly refuted by others who argued that professional audio processing is significantly more demanding in terms of latency, bandwidth, and fidelity than voice communication.
*   **FOSS vs. Commercial & UI Quality:** Commenters noted the difference in user interface quality between commercial and FOSS plugins, with some lamenting the often-plain aesthetics of free tools while others pointed out exceptions like Surge and Vital. The site was commended for including filters for both free and commercial software.
*   **Humor and Community:** The discussion also included lighthearted comments about the "Linux musician" stereotype and a clarification that the site is a directory, not an "ad" as one user initially assumed.

## [UK accounting body to halt remote exams amid AI cheating](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/29/uk-accounting-remote-exams-ai-cheating-acca)
**Score:** 164 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46420289

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports that the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a major UK accounting body, will stop offering remote exams. This decision is a direct response to the rise of AI-powered cheating, which has made it too easy for candidates to cheat undetected. The ACCA will now require students to sit assessments in person, with remote options only available under "exceptional circumstances." The move reverses a shift to online testing that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and was seen as a cost-saving measure for the exam providers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly cynical about the motivations of professional bodies like the ACCA and universities. A dominant theme is that these institutions are primarily acting to protect their "relevancy as gatekeepers" and revenue streams, rather than for purely educational reasons. One commenter argues that the shift to remote exams was a profit-driven move to begin with, allowing bodies to outsource administration to companies like Pearson while charging students the same high fees.

There is a broad consensus that AI has fundamentally changed the nature of cheating. Commenters contrast old methods, which still required some knowledge to find and apply information, with modern AI which can solve problems with a simple copy-paste. This has allegedly normalized cheating among students, who feel they must use AI to keep up. Several anecdotes are shared about students who performed well on homework (potentially with outside help) but failed in-person exams, highlighting the integrity problem.

The conversation then pivots to potential solutions. While some argue that in-person, pen-and-paper exams are the only way to ensure integrity, others point out that even these can be subverted by sophisticated, high-tech cheating methods. The idea of oral exams is floated as a more robust alternative, though noted as difficult to scale. A professor in the discussion states they are moving back to in-person, on-paper tests to combat cheating, seeing it as a way to re-establish the value of a physical college education in the AI era. However, a counterpoint is raised that the core issue is that universities and colleges are failing to teach relevant, job-ready skills, making their gatekeeping role questionable regardless of the exam format.

## [Panoramas of Star Trek Sets](https://mijofr.github.io/st-panorama/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46417752

> **Article:** The article links to a web project that presents interactive 360-degree panoramas of classic Star Trek sets. The source material is extracted from 1990s-era QuickTime VR (QTVR) files found on CD-ROMs like the *Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual* and *Captain's Chair* game. The site allows users to virtually explore iconic locations such as the Enterprise-D bridge, crew quarters, and other sets from TNG and the original series, offering a nostalgic and immersive look at the production design of the shows.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with strong nostalgia, with many commenters immediately recalling the original 1990s CD-ROMs where these panoramas first appeared, describing them as a marvel of their time. The experience of exploring the sets was a common theme, with users noting how familiar and like a "second home" the Enterprise-D felt, and how the immersive quality made them feel as if they had actually been there. Several specific details were pointed out, such as a glimpse of the camera rig in a mirror, the door to the bridge bathroom, and the shock-absorbing floor of the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. The discussion also touched on the technical origins of the panoramas and included a link to a related Roddenberry Archive project. A brief tangent critiqued the writing of *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds* while universally praising its set design, linking to an external article on the subject.
