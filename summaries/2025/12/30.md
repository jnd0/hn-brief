## [Google is dead. Where do we go now?](https://www.circusscientist.com/2025/12/29/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/)
**Score:** 910 | **Comments:** 719 | **ID:** 46425198

> **Article:** The article, written by the operator of a small entertainment agency in Durban, South Africa, laments the decline of Google AdWords as an effective marketing tool. The author claims that for the first time in 15 years, their AdWords campaigns are failing to generate leads, despite significant spending. They argue that the platform has become overly complex, expensive, and less effective for small businesses with local, specific needs. The post is a plea for advice, asking other small business owners where they should turn for marketing now that "Google is dead" for them.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the article's premise, with a mix of agreement, skepticism, and broader analysis. Many commenters agree that the effectiveness of Google AdWords for small businesses has declined, attributing it to factors like click fraud, rising costs, and the platform's increasing complexity. However, several users push back against the "Google is dead" headline, pointing to the company's strong financial performance and arguing the article is specifically about AdWords, not the entire company.

A significant portion of the conversation explores the broader context of this shift. Some see it as a symptom of the "dead internet," where AI-generated content and the decline of the open web are making traditional search and advertising less relevant. Anecdotal evidence is shared about people, especially younger generations, discovering services through social media apps like TikTok instead of search engines. The viability of alternative search engines like Kagi is also debated, with the consensus being that they depend on the same open web ecosystem that is now decaying. Ultimately, the discussion reflects a sense of uncertainty about the future of online discovery and marketing for small businesses.

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 753 | **Comments:** 449 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red, the parent company of the GOG.com digital storefront, is selling GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The acquisition will see GOG become a private company separate from CD Projekt. According to the official announcement, this move allows CD Projekt to focus exclusively on developing RPGs and entertainment based on its intellectual properties. For GOG, the sale provides an opportunity to secure dedicated backing to pursue its mission of selling DRM-free games and preserving classic titles.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the acquisition, viewing it as a positive move for game preservation and the continuation of GOG's pro-consumer, DRM-free philosophy. Many commenters expressed relief that GOG would be insulated from the volatile pressures of the stock market, particularly given CD Projekt's recent history with the high-stakes release of *Cyberpunk 2077*. The consensus is that GOG's niche focus is safer as a standalone entity rather than a subsidiary that might be shut down to recoup losses from a potential future flop.

However, there was some skepticism regarding GOG's financial health. While the official announcement described the past year as "encouraging," some users interpreted this corporate language as a sign that the platform is struggling financially and that the sale is a rescue operation rather than a strategic expansion.

Feature requests and platform comparisons also dominated the discussion. Linux users reiterated their long-standing request for an official client, though others noted that third-party tools like Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher already provide a workaround. Several users defended GOG's value proposition, arguing that true ownership of DRM-free games outweighs the minor inconveniences of GOG's interface or slightly higher prices compared to Steam sales.

## [Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain collapses as partner writes down deal by 99%](https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/)
**Score:** 520 | **Comments:** 576 | **ID:** 46423290

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that L&F, a key supplier for Tesla's 4680 battery cells, has written down its supply agreement with Tesla from a value of $2.9 billion to just $7,386. This massive 99.999% reduction indicates a near-total collapse of the supply chain deal. The 4680 cells were a cornerstone of Tesla's strategy to produce a low-cost $25,000 vehicle and reduce battery costs, but the project has been plagued by manufacturing issues, including high defect rates. The write-down suggests that Tesla's demand for the cathode material from L&F has evaporated, casting serious doubt on the future of the 4680 battery program.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is highly skeptical of Tesla, with commenters viewing this news as another data point in a long series of failures and overhyped promises. The dominant theme is the perceived disconnect between Tesla's operational struggles and its high stock valuation. One commenter argues that TSLA is essentially a "call option on Musk succeeding," where the stock's value is detached from the company's performance and relies on a "greater fool" theory. This sentiment is supported by numerous links to other recent negative news, such as plunging sales in Europe and China, and accusations that Tesla is engaging in quasi-fraud by having SpaceX buy unsold Cybertrucks to inflate revenue.

Regarding the 4680 battery specifically, commenters are divided on the severity but agree on the underlying issues. Some dismiss the technology as unremarkable, suggesting it was just a "bigger form factor with a tweaked chemistry that apparently just didn't work out." Others point to previous reports of massive manufacturing defects (70-80% cathode loss) as the likely cause. A notable observation is that the remaining contract value of $7,386 is roughly the cost of a single Cybertruck battery pack, implying Tesla expects to produce no more than one additional vehicle using this supply agreement. While a few commenters express skepticism towards the source (Electrek) or suggest Tesla might be simply "rejigging suppliers," the overwhelming consensus is that this is a significant failure for a key technological pillar of the company.

## [List of domains censored by German ISPs](https://cuiiliste.de/domains)
**Score:** 384 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46423566

> **Article:** The article links to "cuiiliste.de," a website that maintains a list of domains censored by German Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The censorship is primarily focused on websites involved in copyright infringement, particularly illegal streaming and torrenting sites. The list is managed by CUII, a private organization that compiles these domains, and the blocks are implemented voluntarily by ISPs rather than being a government mandate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals that the censorship is implemented via DNS blocks by participating ISPs, a method easily bypassed by using alternative DNS providers like NextDNS, ControlD, or DNS-over-HTTPS. Commenters note that the list is surprisingly small (around 295 domains) and is dominated by copyright infringement sites, suggesting it's more a result of lobbying by the film industry than a broad effort to block malware or other harmful content. There is a clear distinction made between this private, industry-led initiative and direct government action, though some users still criticize German authorities for being draconian on copyright and other issues like "hate speech." The conversation also touches on which ISPs participate, with some smaller providers opting out, and the topic of Anna's Archive and Sci-Hub being on the list, which some see as an overreach. A talk on the subject at the upcoming Chaos Communication Congress (39c3) is also mentioned.

## [I migrated to an almost all-EU stack and saved 500€ per year](https://www.zeitgeistofbytes.com/p/bye-bye-big-tech-how-i-migrated-to)
**Score:** 284 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46427582

> **Article:** The article details the author's journey to migrate their personal tech stack away from US-based "Big Tech" (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) to primarily European alternatives. The goal was to enhance privacy, support open-source principles, and reduce vendor lock-in. The author provides a detailed breakdown of their new stack, including services for email (Proton Mail), cloud storage (Proton Drive), blogging (Substack, with a note on alternatives), VPN (Mullvad), and password management (Bitwarden). A key outcome highlighted is a financial saving of approximately €500 per year compared to their previous setup. The author acknowledges that while some services are not perfect (like Proton's search functionality), the trade-offs are worthwhile for increased privacy and control.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community with diverse and often conflicting views on privacy, cost, and technical effort. A central theme is the feasibility and value of the proposed migration. Many users challenge the author's choices, pointing out that "EU-based" does not automatically guarantee better privacy or service quality. There is significant debate around the practicality of the new stack, with several users highlighting specific pain points like the poor search functionality in Proton Mail and the performance demands of self-hosted solutions like NextCloud.

The conversation splits into several distinct camps:
*   **The Self-Hosting Advocates:** A vocal group argues that true independence comes from self-hosting with open-source software (NextCloud, Baïkal) on personal hardware, avoiding any third-party ecosystem, whether US or EU-based.
*   **The Pragmatic Skeptics:** These users question the entire premise, stating they have no need for many of these services or that the author's chosen alternatives are inferior to the Big Tech incumbents. Some defend Big Tech, arguing that the privacy concerns are overblown or that the services offer unbeatable value (e.g., Google Workspace).
*   **The Privacy-First Migrators:** This group supports the author's goal but critiques the specific implementation. They suggest alternative services (like Zoho or Infomaniak) or emphasize foundational steps like owning your own domain and maintaining backups, regardless of the provider.

Ultimately, the discussion underscores that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The choice involves a complex trade-off between cost, convenience, features, privacy, and the technical skill required for setup and maintenance.

## [The future of software development is software developers](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/11/25/the-future-of-software-development-is-software-developers/)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 263 | **ID:** 46424233

> **Article:** The article, "The future of software development is software developers," argues that the core challenge of programming is not writing code, but the cognitive process of translating ambiguous human requirements into precise, computational logic. The author contends that this fundamental difficulty remains constant regardless of the technology used, from punch cards to modern AI. While acknowledging the hype, the author expresses skepticism about the long-term viability of current AI models due to their immense training costs and the massive financial losses incurred by their developers, suggesting the technology may not be sustainable in its current form.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the profound and often unsettling implications of AI on the software development profession. A central theme is the tension between AI as a powerful productivity multiplier and as a potential threat to developers' skills and job security.

Several users express personal anxiety about the rapid advancements. One commenter feels like a "conductor" for an AI that now performs tasks like design, planning, and bug-finding, making them feel as productive as an entire team of twenty engineers, but also "scary" vulnerable. This sentiment is echoed by others who note the difficulty new graduates are facing in the job market, suggesting the impact is already being felt.

However, a strong counter-argument emerges, rooted in the distinction between pattern-matching and genuine understanding. Skeptics argue that LLMs are "fooled by randomness," interpolating from vast datasets but lacking the ability to reason about truly novel problems, such as writing drivers for new hardware or modeling new regulations. This leads to the "Swiss cheese" analogy: AI can be a useful layer in a process, but it has significant holes that require human oversight to ensure safety and correctness. The comparison to past "job-killer" technologies like Visual Basic and Delphi is also used to suggest that AI will augment, not replace, skilled developers who are needed to handle complex edge cases and build robust systems.

Finally, the conversation touches on the long-term health of the AI ecosystem. One commenter posits a "data quality doom loop," where the proliferation of AI-generated "slop code" will pollute the training data for future models, creating a hard limit on their improvement. Another, however, counters that future progress will rely less on scraped internet data and more on reinforcement learning and curated datasets, mitigating this risk. The historical parallel to the Luddites is also drawn, questioning whether the current disruption is truly different from past industrial revolutions.

## [ManusAI Joins Meta](https://manus.im/blog/manus-joins-meta-for-next-era-of-innovation)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46426534

> **Article:** The article from Manus.im announces that the Manus AI team is joining Meta. The post frames the move as a significant step for the team and a validation of their work in developing General AI Agents, positioning it as the beginning of a "next era of innovation."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and critical of the announcement. The dominant theme is disbelief and mockery, with many commenters pointing out that the announcement's language (e.g., "This announcement is more than just a headline") reads like AI-generated or satirical corporate speak, leading some to initially question if the website was real.

There is significant speculation about the strategic rationale behind the acquisition. Users question why Meta, a company with vast resources, would need to acquire a startup instead of building the technology in-house. This leads to theories that it's primarily a "talent acquisition" ("acqui-hire") to poach skilled engineers, especially after Meta's recent AI talent departures. The lack of a disclosed purchase price fuels further speculation about the deal's size and whether it was a soft landing for investors rather than a major cash buyout.

Finally, there is broad skepticism about Meta's ability to integrate the company successfully. Commenters cite Meta's poor track record with acquisitions like Oculus and express concern that the startup's innovation will stagnate within a large corporate structure. This is coupled with broader ethical concerns about Meta's role in society, with one prominent comment comparing the company's business practices to the tobacco industry and arguing against giving it more powerful technology.

## [All Delisted Steam Games](https://delistedgames.com/all-delisted-steam-games/)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46424262

> **Article:** The article links to "All Delisted Steam Games," a comprehensive list of video games that have been removed from the Steam store and can no longer be purchased. The list details the reasons for each game's removal, which primarily include expired licensing agreements (especially for games with real-world brands like cars or franchises like Warhammer), the closure of the developer or publisher, or the release of a remastered/updated version that replaces the original.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the primary causes and frustrating consequences of game delisting, with licensing being the most cited reason. Users express dismay over losing access to games they enjoyed, such as the *Space Hulk* and *Blur* titles, arguing that licensing deals ultimately harm consumers by making legally purchased content unavailable for new buyers.

There is a general consensus that owning a digital copy provides some protection; several users confirmed that delisted games remain downloadable and playable for those who already own them, a practice they appreciate. This led to debates about digital ownership, with some users expressing fear that platforms like Steam could one day revoke access, while others pointed out that even closed ecosystems like the Nintendo 3DS eShop still allow redownloads of purchased titles.

The conversation also touched on related topics, including:
*   **The cost of IP:** A debate on whether using established IPs (like D&D for *Baldur's Gate 3*) is worth the financial burden and creative constraints for developers.
*   **Platform loyalty:** A brief side-discussion arose regarding the preference for Steam over the Epic Games Store and Windows, driven by concerns over privacy, OS features, and user experience.
*   **Community efforts:** Users shared resources like a Steam group for collectors of removed games and tools like SteamDB to help identify and track delisted titles.

**Score:** 245 | **Comments:** 437 | **ID:** 46427586

> **Article:** The article reports that the creator of "Stranger Things," the Duffer Brothers, has publicly advised viewers to turn off "garbage" settings on their modern televisions. The primary target of this criticism is motion smoothing, a feature often referred to as the "soap opera effect" because it creates unnaturally fluid motion that undermines the cinematic look of film. The creators' plea is aimed at preserving the intended visual aesthetic of their show, which is carefully crafted through specific color grading and frame rates. They join a long list of filmmakers who have campaigned against these default TV settings that distort their work.

## [Swapping SIM cards used to be easy, and then came eSIM](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 262 | **ID:** 46421653

> **Article:** The article on Ars Technica details the author's frustrating experience with eSIM technology in 2025. While the author acknowledges the theoretical benefits, such as easier international roaming, the practical reality was a nightmare. The author highlights several key pain points: the inability to easily transfer an eSIM to a new device without carrier intervention, poor support from carriers for troubleshooting, and the loss of user autonomy. The piece argues that eSIMs, unlike physical SIMs, shift control away from the user and into the hands of carriers and manufacturers, turning a simple task like swapping a SIM card into a complex, often online-dependent process that can fail at any step.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a deeply divided view on eSIMs, with users' experiences largely dependent on their specific use case and ecosystem.

A significant portion of the comments echo the article's negative sentiment, viewing eSIMs as another move by "big tech" to restrict user freedom. These users argue that eSIMs are designed to lock users into carrier ecosystems, making it difficult to switch devices or providers without carrier approval. They share anecdotes of failed activations, the inability to transfer eSIMs between phones, and the general hassle of dealing with customer support instead of simply swapping a physical card.

Conversely, many other users report seamless and even superior experiences, particularly within the Apple ecosystem. For these users, upgrading from one iPhone to another is often a non-issue, with the eSIM transferring automatically during the device migration process. This positive experience extends to international travel, where the ability to instantly download and activate a local data plan via an app is seen as a major convenience, eliminating the need to find a store or wait for a physical SIM to be mailed.

The discussion also touches on broader themes, with some users lamenting the loss of user-replaceable components like headphone jacks and microSD cards, while others defend their choice to stick with brands like Sony that still offer these features. A technical perspective was also provided, explaining that while the eSIM technology itself is powerful and enables new business models, its implementation is often hampered by carrier-imposed restrictions designed to protect their business models.

## [AI is forcing us to write good code](https://bits.logic.inc/p/ai-is-forcing-us-to-write-good-code)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46424200

> **Article:** The article "AI is forcing us to write good code" argues that the rise of AI coding assistants necessitates a stricter adherence to software engineering best practices. The author posits that while AI can generate code rapidly, it struggles with ambiguity and "bad" codebases. To effectively leverage AI, developers must create a highly structured environment. This includes enforcing 100% test coverage, comprehensive type checking (e.g., end-to-end types from the database), deterministic formatting, and eliminating anti-patterns like mocks and thrown exceptions. The author's thesis is that these constraints act as guardrails, turning the AI from a unpredictable generator into a highly effective tool within a verifiable system, ultimately forcing teams to improve their code quality to keep up with the AI's capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a polarized debate on the article's premise. A central theme is skepticism towards the author's motives and experience, with several commenters dismissing the post as self-promotional "vanity blogging" for the author's startup. Others express concern that such advice could mislead junior developers into believing AI-centric development is a silver bullet, potentially devaluing fundamental engineering skills that were important long before AI.

On the other side, proponents of the article's view agree that AI is changing the value of traditional best practices. They argue that while things like 100% test coverage and strong typing were always good ideas, they are now becoming essential for creating a predictable environment where AI can operate effectively. These practices provide the "reified context" and guardrails that AI agents need to be safe and productive. A notable counterpoint was raised about the feasibility of the author's claims, specifically questioning how a TypeScript test suite for hundreds of thousands of lines could run in under a second, casting doubt on the technical specifics. The conversation also touched on broader implications, such as whether AI will commoditize routine coding and shift the value to more novel or high-risk software engineering.

## [Nvidia takes $5B stake in Intel under September agreement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/nvidia-takes-5-billion-stake-intel-under-september-agreement-2025-12-29/)
**Score:** 216 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46423010

> **Article:** Nvidia is taking a $5 billion stake in Intel, acquiring a significant share as part of an agreement made in September. This investment positions Nvidia as one of Intel's largest shareholders, holding approximately 4% of the company following the issuance of new shares. The deal marks a major financial tie between the two semiconductor giants.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the investment is largely skeptical and cynical. The prevailing sentiment is that money alone cannot solve Intel's deep-seated manufacturing and technical problems, with users noting that Intel lacks the specialized "wizards" needed to master advanced chip fabrication, particularly EUV technology.

Commenters also raised concerns about market concentration and the circular flow of capital. Several users pointed out the irony of Nvidia, a dominant AI chipmaker, investing in Intel, which could otherwise be seen as a competitor in the AI space. This led to broader debates about the "velocity of money" and whether the current economic environment resembles past bubbles. There was also a philosophical side-discussion about corporate ownership structures, with some questioning the utility of companies owning other companies, while others defended it as a necessary shield against liability.

## [Netflix: Open Content](https://opencontent.netflix.com/)
**Score:** 206 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46431560

> **Article:** The article links to "Netflix: Open Content," a minimalist webpage that serves as a repository for technical assets, such as test footage and sample media files, released by Netflix. The content is intended for developers and industry professionals to test media pipelines, codecs, and other video-related technologies. The site appears to be a static, low-effort page, with its last update noted in 2020.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely a critique of the page's poor quality and a debate over its purpose. The most prominent criticisms focus on the technical and presentational flaws: users were surprised to find that download links use plain HTTP instead of HTTPS, and the overall design is described as a generic free template, suggesting a lack of investment or maintenance. Commenters speculate that the project was likely a small, internal effort that has since been abandoned, noting that the last update was in 2020.

Regarding the page's purpose, users concluded it's not for public content consumption but rather a tool for industry collaboration. The primary theory is that Netflix is sharing these assets to help partners and open-source projects test and improve video codecs and media pipelines, which ultimately benefits Netflix by reducing its own bandwidth costs.

Broader discussions emerged from the post. One thread lamented the lack of innovation in online video compared to physical media (like DVDs), which offered more bonus features. Another user pointed to a more modern and active initiative, the ASWF Digital Production Example Library (DPEL), which contains more recent Netflix content for similar industry testing purposes.

## [LLMs Are Not Fun](https://orib.dev/nofun.html)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46424136

> **Article:** The article "LLMs Are Not Fun" argues that the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in programming is stripping the craft of its joy and meaning. The author contends that the pleasure of programming lies in deep problem understanding, the intellectual challenge of navigating complex systems, and the satisfaction of creating a solution with one's own mind and hands. They contrast this with the experience of using LLMs, which they describe as a tedious process of "prompting, waiting, reading, debugging, and repeating." This workflow, they argue, turns programming from an act of creation into one of management and verification, severing the direct connection between intent and implementation and making the process feel hollow and un-fun.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and personal divide among developers regarding the enjoyment and role of LLMs in their work. The debate is not merely about utility, but about the fundamental nature of programming as a craft.

A significant portion of the commenters strongly disagree with the article's premise, arguing that LLMs have made programming *more* fun. They contend that LLMs act as a "force multiplier" that automates the tedious and frustrating parts of development—such as boilerplate, syntax lookups, and debugging minor errors—freeing them to focus on the more enjoyable aspects like high-level design, architecture, and creative problem-solving. For these individuals, the fun comes from the end result and the ability to bring ideas to life quickly, not from the act of typing out code line-by-line.

Conversely, a vocal group expresses empathy for the author's perspective, framing it as a defense of the intrinsic joy found in the *process* of creation. They worry that outsourcing the "thinking" to an AI devalues the craft and removes the meaningful experiences of deep understanding and personal struggle that define their professional satisfaction. This side often points to the immense social and corporate pressure to embrace AI tools, praising the author's "bravery" in publicly rejecting the hype.

The discussion also highlights a pragmatic middle ground. Some developers see LLMs as a useful but imperfect tool, best applied to tedious tasks while acknowledging that production-ready, high-quality code still requires significant human oversight and effort. The debate ultimately centers on a core question: is the value of programming derived from the act of creation itself, or from the tangible outcome?

## [Static Allocation with Zig](https://nickmonad.blog/2025/static-allocation-with-zig-kv/)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46422009

> **Article:** The article "Static Allocation with Zig" describes a proof-of-concept key-value store written in Zig that adheres to a strict memory allocation strategy: all memory is allocated upfront at initialization, with no dynamic allocation or deallocation during runtime. This approach, inspired by the "TigerStyle" used by the TigerBeetle database, aims to achieve predictable performance, eliminate runtime allocation overhead, and prevent memory errors like use-after-free. The author demonstrates how to implement this in Zig using memory pools and free lists to manage pre-allocated buffers for keys and values.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, noting that while the technique is not new, its application to a database like TigerBeetle has brought it renewed attention. The conversation centers on the trade-offs and motivations behind this approach.

Key points of agreement include the benefits of static allocation for operational predictability (consistent latency), code simplicity, and serving as a forcing function to define system limits upfront. It is also seen as a crucial safety mechanism in Zig, which lacks a borrow checker, to prevent use-after-free bugs.

However, several commenters raised important distinctions and concerns:
*   **In-Memory vs. File-Backed:** A critical distinction was made between TigerBeetle (which is file-backed and only statically allocates in-memory working structures) and the article's in-memory key-value store. For the latter, pre-allocating all memory means imposing a hard limit on total capacity and paying the memory cost upfront, which may only be suitable for specific use cases.
*   **Practical Challenges:** Commenters questioned whether this truly prevents runtime errors, pointing out that one must still manage which pre-allocated slots are "in use," which is a form of manual memory management. The risk of OS overcommit was also raised, with a workaround suggested.
*   **Context:** The technique was contextualized as common in embedded systems but a deliberate, noteworthy choice for high-performance server applications.

Overall, the discussion treated the approach as a powerful but specialized pattern, valuable for its performance and safety guarantees but requiring careful consideration of its implications on system design and resource usage.

## [HSBC blocks its app due to F-Droid-installed Bitwarden](https://mastodon.neilzone.co.uk/@neil/115807834298031971)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 179 | **ID:** 46431453

> **Article:** The article, shared via a Mastodon post, describes a user whose HSBC banking app blocked access. The block was triggered because the user had the Bitwarden password manager installed via F-Droid, an alternative app store. The app's detection of Bitwarden, likely through scanning installed applications, caused HSBC to refuse to function, flagging the setup as a potential security risk.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the conflict between aggressive bank security measures and user freedom/control over their own devices. The consensus is that while banks' motivations to prevent fraud are understandable, their methods are often overly restrictive, intrusive, and treat all users like potential threats.

Several key points were raised:

*   **The Technical Reason:** Commenters identified that HSBC likely uses a combination of Android APIs to scan for installed apps and employs Google's SafetyNet attestation service. This service checks a device's integrity, and HSBC has configured it to a strict level that fails if non-standard apps (like those from F-Droid) or developer settings are present. Google allows this for financial apps, creating a loophole in their own privacy-centric API changes.

*   **Security Theater vs. Real Threats:** Many argued that these measures are "security theatre." They don't stop the most prevalent threats, such as scams and social engineering ("pig butchering"), where a user is tricked into making a legitimate transaction. Instead, they alienate tech-savvy users who understand the risks and are capable of managing their own security.

*   **User Agency and Alternatives:** A central theme is the loss of user control. The discussion highlights several workarounds and alternatives:
    *   **Switching Banks:** Many users advocate for switching to banks like Monzo, which provide a warning but allow the user to proceed, treating them as adults.
    *   **Dedicated Devices:** Some power users resort to using a separate, stock phone just for banking.
    *   **Work Profiles:** Isolating banking apps in a work profile was suggested as a potential solution.
    *   **Web Banking:** Ditching apps entirely in favor of robust web-based banking was proposed as a way to regain control.

*   **Broader Implications:** The conversation expanded beyond the specific issue to touch on larger societal concerns. Commenters discussed the growing trend of "de-banking," where financial institutions cut off services based on opaque risk assessments or external pressure (e.g., US sanctions), leaving individuals without access to essential financial services. This incident is framed as part of a larger struggle over digital rights and corporate control.

## [Nicolas Guillou, French ICC judge sanctioned by the US and “debanked”](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/19/nicolas-guillou-french-icc-judge-sanctioned-by-the-us-you-are-effectively-blacklisted-by-much-of-the-world-s-banking-system_6747628_4.html)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46432057

> **Article:** The article from Le Monde details how Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), has been sanctioned by the United States. This sanction has effectively "debanked" him, cutting him off from much of the global banking system and making it nearly impossible for him to manage his personal finances. The US sanctions are linked to the ICC's investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israeli officials in the Palestinian territories. Guillou is one of several ICC officials targeted, a move that has drawn condemnation from European leaders who are now exploring mechanisms to protect their citizens and the court's independence from US financial pressure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the US sanctions, framing them as an abuse of power that undermines the rule of law and international institutions. A central theme is the hypocrisy of using a human rights sanctions framework against judges who are prosecuting human rights violations. Many commenters argue this action erodes American soft power and exposes the "rules-based order" as a tool of foreign policy rather than a consistent principle.

The conversation branches into several related topics:
*   **Criticism of US Foreign Policy:** The sanctions are seen as part of a broader pattern of the US using its financial dominance to advance geopolitical goals, with several commenters noting similar actions against a Brazilian judge and a UN rapporteur.
*   **The Future of Financial Power:** Some users suggest that such unilateral actions will accelerate the "de-dollarization" trend, pushing other nations to find alternatives to the US-centric financial system.
*   **Debate on Bitcoin and Alternatives:** A sub-thread debates whether cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could serve as a refuge from state-controlled finance. Opinions are split, with some seeing it as a necessary escape route for the "debanked" and others dismissing it as unsustainable and primarily for criminals.
*   **US Domestic Politics:** The discussion frequently links the international action to the perceived state of US democracy under the Trump administration, with commenters describing the government as authoritarian and lawless, thereby losing any moral high ground to sanction others.
*   **The ICC's Position:** While some argue the US is simply acting in its self-interest by protecting an ally and rejecting the ICC's jurisdiction, the prevailing sentiment is that the sanctions are a disproportionate and dangerous escalation that threatens the court's ability to function impartially.

## [Show HN: Stop Claude Code from forgetting everything](https://github.com/mutable-state-inc/ensue-skill)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46426624

> **Project:** The project, "Ensue Skill," is a tool designed to provide persistent, long-term memory for AI coding assistants, specifically targeting Claude Code. It addresses the problem of AI forgetting context between sessions, days, or tasks. The system works by capturing conversation history and tool calls, then organizing them into a structured, queryable knowledge base (described as a "semantic, entity-based hypergraph"). This allows developers to later query their past work, re-establish context, and reflect on previous reasoning, for example asking "what was I actually trying to fix here?" days after a session has ended. It is implemented as a skill that connects to an external MCP server.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revealed a mix of enthusiasm for the concept and skepticism about its necessity and implementation. The core problem it solves—maintaining context across long or interrupted coding sessions—was validated by several users who shared their own struggles with memory loss in AI agents.

Key points of discussion included:
*   **Mechanism and Use Cases:** Users were curious about how it works. The author explained it uses an MCP server to store conversations in a structured way, enabling retrieval that is more robust than simple summarization, which can miss details. The primary use case highlighted was for long research sessions and returning to projects after a break.
*   **Skepticism and Simpler Alternatives:** A recurring theme was skepticism about the need for a complex external tool. Some commenters argued that native features like a detailed `CLAUDE.md` file or simply asking the AI to review its own past conversation logs are sufficient. One user pointed to a much simpler, instruction-only "skill" that uses `ripgrep` to find history as a lightweight alternative.
*   **Privacy and Self-Hosting:** A significant concern was data privacy, with users asking about data retention policies and the availability of a self-hosted option to avoid sending proprietary code to a third-party server. The author acknowledged this is a common and reasonable request.
*   **Broader Ecosystem Fatigue:** One commenter broadened the topic, expressing feeling overwhelmed by the proliferation of tools (agents, skills, rules) needed for Claude Code, suggesting the ecosystem is creating unnecessary complexity. This sparked a debate about whether such tools are genuinely helpful or just add to the noise.
*   **Future Vision:** The author clarified that the ultimate value isn't just for a single agent's memory, but for creating a portable, external context layer that can be shared across different tools (e.g., Claude, Codex, Cursor) and agents, solving the problem of context fragmentation.

## [When someone says they hate your product](https://www.getflack.com/p/responding-to-negative-feedback)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46424460

> **Article:** The article "When someone says they hate your product" advises founders and product teams to treat negative feedback as a valuable signal rather than a personal attack. The core message is to de-escalate conflict by listening, acknowledging the user's frustration, and separating the actionable "signal" (e.g., a broken workflow, confusing pricing) from the emotional "theatrics." The author recommends responding with empathy, asking clarifying questions, and focusing on solving the underlying problem. This approach can turn hostile critics into passionate advocates and provides a public record of responsiveness that benefits future customers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's advice, but with significant nuance and caution. A central theme is that while the article's mature approach is ideal, it's not always practical. Commenters explore the complexities of handling negative feedback, distinguishing between constructive criticism and unhelpful venting. Many shared personal anecdotes where engaging with "haters" turned them into valuable contributors, reinforcing the idea that frustration often stems from a desire for the product to be better. However, others countered that some users are simply toxic and should be "fired" for the health of the team and product.

The conversation also touched on the root causes of user frustration, with some commenters arguing that dominant products often become complacent and poor quality because they lack real market competition. A minor but notable side-thread debated the anthropomorphization of AI models, with one user strongly objecting to the phrase "Claude gets it." Overall, the community agreed that the key is to separate the signal from the noise in feedback, de-escalate the situation, and use the criticism as fuel for innovation.

## [Hacking Washing Machines [video]](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-hacking-washing-machines)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46428496

> **Article:** The article is a video from the Chaos Communication Congress (39c3) titled "Hacking Washing Machines." The presentation details the security research conducted on modern washing machines from major manufacturers like BSH (Bosch/Siemens) and Miele. The researchers explored various attack vectors, including the Wi-Fi connectivity, the user interface, and even an unusual optical communication port used by Miele for diagnostics. The talk demonstrates how these "smart" appliances can be compromised, highlighting vulnerabilities in their software and network implementations. A key technical detail discussed is the optical port, which is used for electrical isolation to protect users and technicians from the high mains voltage present inside the appliance.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was largely positive, with commenters noting the constructive engagement from the manufacturers. Several users pointed out that BSH and Miele proactively contacted the researchers to address vulnerabilities, a sign of a mature and collaborative security culture.

The technical aspects of the talk sparked considerable interest. Commenters debated the purpose of the optical communication port on the Miele machine, with one user correctly identifying its primary value as electrical isolation rather than just moisture protection. This led to curiosity about other devices that might use similar optical communication for safety.

The conversation also branched out into related topics. One commenter shared a classic example of programming a washing machine in the Forth language, while others humorously discussed the mechanics of door locks (wax motors vs. solenoids) and the classic sci-fi trope of a machine refusing a user's command.

Underlying the technical curiosity was a broader anxiety about the "Internet of Things." Users expressed a strong desire for appliances to function reliably offline, fearing a future where devices are useless without an internet connection or are subject to buggy over-the-air updates. There was a call for legislation to protect consumers and ensure that smart features remain optional and that local control is always available. The discussion concluded with a mix of appreciation for the research and skepticism about the value of adding "smart" features to fundamentally simple appliances.
