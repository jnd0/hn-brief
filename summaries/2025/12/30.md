## [Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn](https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/)
**Score:** 981 | **Comments:** 868 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article, titled "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn," is a personal narrative detailing a disastrous travel experience with Germany's national railway. The author's journey from Munich to a town in Switzerland was plagued by cascading failures: a series of delays, a cancelled connection, and a confusing rerouting. The climax of the ordeal occurred when the replacement train, despite being physically at the author's intended destination station, was not scheduled to stop there. Due to a bureaucratic rule, the train was forced to continue for another 60 kilometers to a different station, effectively "kidnapping" the passengers. The author was left stranded far from their destination late at night, forced to take a taxi to finally reach their home. The piece is a critique of the Deutsche Bahn's inflexible rules, poor communication, and lack of customer-centric service.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly evolved into a broad, international debate on the state of railway systems, with the Deutsche Bahn (DB) article serving as a catalyst. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A significant portion of the comments involved comparative suffering, particularly between Germany and the UK. While some initially argued that DB was better than the notoriously dysfunctional British rail network, others countered that this was a "race to the bottom." Commenters detailed the UK's issues with exorbitant, airline-style pricing and frequent delays, but also highlighted its silver linings, such as the "Delay Repay" compensation system and generally good customer service. The high cost of UK rail was a frequent point of comparison, with some noting that German tickets, while not cheap, are often more affordable.

The discussion also broadened to include other European countries. A common sentiment was that Spain and Italy were perceived as having better-run systems, though this was immediately challenged by a commenter who described Italian trains as "terrible," citing an example of a 100km journey taking six hours. Denmark was also mentioned, with one user defending its DSB railway as reliable, while another included it in the "avoid" zone alongside Germany and France.

A central debate emerged around the root causes of these failures. Some commenters defended DB, arguing that many delays are due to unpredictable events like accidents or suicides, and that Germans have an "insatiable attitude" of complaining without appreciating the system's overall robustness. However, the prevailing view was that the problems are systemic. Commenters pointed to a lack of investment, insufficient redundancy in the network, and a rigid bureaucracy that prioritizes rules over passenger welfare, as exemplified by the article's core incident.

Finally, there was a recurring call for stronger passenger rights and financial incentives for operators. Several users suggested that rail companies should be subject to the same strict compensation rules as airlines to motivate better performance. The issue of language barriers in announcements was also raised, with non-native speakers expressing frustration and vulnerability, while others speculated that staff are simply following rigid contracts.

## [Google is dead. Where do we go now?](https://www.circusscientist.com/2025/12/29/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/)
**Score:** 641 | **Comments:** 578 | **ID:** 46425198

> **Article:** The article, written by the operator of a small entertainment agency in Durban, South Africa, laments the decline of Google AdWords as an effective marketing tool. The author states that their long-running AdWords campaigns, which previously provided a steady stream of leads, have become prohibitively expensive and ineffective, yielding few conversions despite significant spending. The post frames this as a critical problem for small businesses that relied on the platform's direct, intent-based advertising model and asks the community where they should turn for marketing now that this channel has failed.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion revolves around three main themes: the validity of the article's premise, the broader context of the changing internet, and potential alternatives.

Many commenters agreed with the author's experience, attributing the decline of AdWords' effectiveness to rising costs, click fraud, and a general shift in user behavior. Several users noted that people are increasingly discovering businesses through social media platforms like TikTok rather than traditional search engines. There was a consensus that the "open web," which search engines crawl and index, is dying, which in turn threatens the viability of search-based advertising and services like Kagi.

However, some commenters pushed back, pointing out that Google's corporate financials are thriving and the company is far from "dead." Others debated the ethics and effectiveness of online advertising, with some expressing "good riddance" to a system they felt was a scam, while others defended AdWords as a relatively honest model based on user intent compared to algorithm-driven social media ads.

Finally, the discussion touched on the author's own marketing strategy, with some wryly noting that getting their post to the top of Hacker News was a clever non-Google marketing tactic. The author confirmed this was unintentional but welcomed the traffic.

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 570 | **Comments:** 330 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red, the parent company of the digital game store GOG, is selling GOG back to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The official rationale is strategic: CD Projekt wants to focus exclusively on developing high-quality RPGs and entertainment based on its intellectual properties (like The Witcher and Cyberpunk). This move allows GOG to regain independence and pursue its mission of providing DRM-free games with a focus on long-term ownership and game preservation, a mission shared by its returning founder. GOG's leadership states that the platform is financially stable and had an "encouraging year," and that this acquisition provides the strong backing needed to accelerate its unique value proposition.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction is largely positive, viewing the acquisition as a move that protects GOG's "ethical" and pro-consumer stance. Commenters celebrate GOG as a vital "oasis" for DRM-free gaming and game preservation, a mission they feel is better safeguarded outside the direct pressure of a publicly traded company like CD Projekt. The discussion highlights GOG's core value: customers feel they truly *own* the games they purchase, unlike the "leasing" model perceived on other platforms.

However, there is significant debate over the financial implications. While the official announcement frames GOG as stable, some users are skeptical, interpreting the PR language ("encouraging year") as a potential sign of financial trouble that necessitated the sale. This contrasts with other comments pointing to GOG's recent success with retro gaming events.

A recurring theme is user frustration with GOG's lack of official Linux support. Several commenters express a desire for a native client or official investment in third-party tools like the Heroic Games Launcher, which would better enable them to play their DRM-free library on a libre operating system.

## [List of domains censored by German ISPs](https://cuiiliste.de/domains)
**Score:** 337 | **Comments:** 138 | **ID:** 46423566

> **Article:** The article links to "cuiiliste.de," a website that lists domains censored by German Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The list is maintained by CUII, a private organization that compiles domains containing copyright violations. Major ISPs in Germany voluntarily block these domains, primarily using DNS-level blocks. The list is relatively small (around 295 domains) and is heavily focused on websites involved in illicit streaming and piracy, rather than malware or other security threats.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals that the censorship is driven by private industry interests rather than government mandate. Users clarify that CUII is a private entity, not a government body, and that participation by ISPs is voluntary. There is a consensus that the blocks are easily circumvented by changing DNS providers (such as using NextDNS or ControlD) or enabling DNS-over-HTTPS, leading some to view the blocks as ineffective security theater.

The conversation highlights the specific nature of the blocked sites, which are mostly piracy and streaming services. Some users jokingly treated the list as a "collection of the best pirate sites," while others expressed disappointment that the blocks target copyright infringement rather than malware protection. A recurring theme was the contrast between the "chill" reputation of Germans and the strict enforcement of copyright laws, though some commenters distinguished between the general populace and the legal authorities. Additionally, a few comments pointed out that Anna's Archive and Sci-Hub are on the list, and a future talk at the Chaos Communication Congress (39c3) will discuss the topic further.

## [Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain collapses as partner writes down deal by 99%](https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/)
**Score:** 329 | **Comments:** 353 | **ID:** 46423290

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that L&F, a key supplier for Tesla's 4680 battery cells, has written down its supply contract with Tesla by 99.999%, from a value of $2.9 billion to just $7,386. This massive write-down indicates a near-total collapse of the supply agreement, suggesting that Tesla's production and demand for the 4680 cells have failed to materialize as planned. The 4680 cell was previously touted as a revolutionary "holy grail" battery technology that would enable a $25,000 EV and power the Cybertruck, but this development points to significant struggles in Tesla's battery program and manufacturing capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of Tesla's current trajectory and valuation. The dominant theme is the perceived disconnect between Tesla's stock price and its operational reality. Many commenters argue that the stock functions as a speculative asset or a "call option on Elon Musk" rather than reflecting the company's fundamentals, which they see as deteriorating. This view is supported by numerous links provided by one user detailing Tesla's declining sales across major markets (US, Europe, China) and the poor performance of the Cybertruck.

There is also significant criticism of Elon Musk's leadership and public statements, with users pointing to a pattern of over-promising and under-delivering on products like the Robotaxi and Roadster. Some commenters suggest that Tesla is using related companies like SpaceX to artificially bolster its sales by purchasing unsold Cybertrucks, labeling this as "quasi-fraud."

While a few users express skepticism towards the source article (Electrek) and suggest the battery program might simply be undergoing strategic changes, the prevailing sentiment is that Tesla is a "struggling company" whose stock is a "tulip future" bubble. The discussion concludes with a grim outlook on the broader EV market, with some blaming Tesla's market dominance for hindering wider electrification efforts.

## [Show HN: Vibe coding a bookshelf with Claude Code](https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 192 | **ID:** 46420453

> **Project:** The project is a "vibe coded" web application that creates a digital bookshelf. The developer used Claude Code, an AI-assisted coding tool, to build the project. The resulting application is a single-page HTML/CSS/JS app that runs locally or on a personal website, allowing a user to visually organize and display their books. The project is presented as an example of how AI tools can effectively create "personal software" tailored to an individual's exact needs without the overhead of traditional development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community received the project positively, using it as a springboard to discuss the nature and best practices of "vibe coding." A central theme was defining this new workflow: it's seen as a powerful way for non-professional coders to quickly build personal tools, where the human provides the "intent and taste" and the AI handles the "execution." However, a key point of consensus was that this approach has limitations. As projects grow in size and complexity, the AI struggles with context, often adding unnecessary abstractions rather than making surgical changes. For larger projects, the recommended workflow shifts from pure "vibe coding" to a more collaborative one, where the developer provides architectural guidance and code skeletons for the AI to fill in.

The discussion also touched on the future role of human "taste" in this process, with some optimistic that it will remain a key human contribution, while others believe AI will eventually replicate it. The project also sparked nostalgia for a classic Mac application, Delicious Library, which had a similar purpose and aesthetic. Finally, there was a brief, notable mention of a legal dispute involving SerpApi, a service that provides programmatic search access, highlighting the underlying infrastructure some of these applications might rely on.

## [You can't design software you don't work on](https://www.seangoedecke.com/you-cant-design-software-you-dont-work-on/)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46418415

> **Article:** The article argues that it's impossible to effectively design software for a system you don't actively work on and understand intimately. The author contrasts this with fields like structural engineering, where architects can design a bridge without laying bricks. In software, the "ground truth" of a complex system—its dependencies, legacy code, and subtle interactions—is too dynamic and complex to be captured in high-level plans or diagrams. The author contends that true architectural insight comes from the hands-on experience of implementation. Therefore, the role of a "software architect" who is detached from coding is often ineffective. The best designs emerge incrementally from developers who are deeply embedded in the codebase, as they are the only ones who can react to the real-world complexities and constraints that arise during development.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's central premise but also explores its nuances and potential counterarguments. A key point of agreement is that the "map is not the territory"; high-level plans and generic advice are insufficient without the deep, tacit knowledge held by the engineers building the system, a concept referred to as Naur's Theory of Programming.

Several commenters expand on the article's analogy to structural engineering, noting that while construction has long-lasting principles and tangible constraints, software's "site conditions" (frameworks, languages, requirements) change rapidly and can even be altered by the software itself. This makes upfront, detached design even more perilous in software.

The most detailed counterpoint comes from a user who argues that an experienced architect, having built many large systems, *can* design complex features upfront by applying patterns like separation of concerns and policy from mechanism. However, this is immediately qualified by another user who points out this works for new projects but fails when designing features for an existing, complex codebase where the "ground truth" is already established and constraining.

The discussion also touches on related themes:
*   **The pitfalls of consistency:** While consistency is often cited as a virtue, one commenter warns that "consistently bad" practices are worse than having pockets of better, if inconsistent, code.
*   **Developer-user alignment:** The ideal scenario is when developers are also active users of their own software, as this provides direct motivation and feedback.
*   **The "tree swing cartoon":** This classic cartoon is invoked to perfectly illustrate the communication breakdown between high-level designers and the final implementation, a core problem the article describes.

Ultimately, the conversation reinforces the article's thesis: effective software design is an emergent property of hands-on engagement with the code, not a top-down, abstract exercise.

## [All Delisted Steam Games](https://delistedgames.com/all-delisted-steam-games/)
**Score:** 230 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46424262

> **Article:** The article is a comprehensive list of video games that have been "delisted" from the Steam store, meaning they are no longer available for new purchases. It provides a searchable database of these games, often including the reason for their removal, such as expired licensing agreements, the closure of the developer or publisher, or the release of a remastered version.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the reasons for game delisting and the consequences for consumers. The most frequently cited cause is the expiration of licensing agreements, particularly for games featuring real-world brands like cars (Blur, DiRT) or established franchises (Warhammer). Other common reasons include developers going out of business or publishers shutting down online servers for multiplayer games.

Commenters express frustration that legally purchased games can become inaccessible to new players, though they find some comfort in the fact that Steam generally allows existing owners to re-download and play delisted titles. This leads to a broader debate on digital ownership, with one user celebrating their ability to still download purchased games on defunct platforms like the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

A significant side-discussion emerges around the publisher 2K's decision to delist the original *Mafia* games upon releasing a remake, which is seen as a negative for consumers who preferred the original. Another tangent explores the trade-offs of using a major franchise IP, with a user arguing that *Baldur's Gate 3*'s D&D license, while a massive marketing success, may have hindered the game's mechanics compared to Larian's own *Divinity: Original Sin 2*. Finally, there is a minor thread about the continued availability of the Steam version of *Rocket League* and concerns over its future on Linux.

## [Linux DAW: Help Linux musicians to quickly and easily find the tools they need](https://linuxdaw.org/)
**Score:** 216 | **Comments:** 102 | **ID:** 46419968

> **Article:** The article introduces "Linux DAW" (linuxdaw.org), a new website designed to be a comprehensive directory for musicians using the Linux operating system. Its primary goal is to help users quickly discover and find the tools they need, such as Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), plugins, and other audio software, by providing a centralized, filterable resource.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction was largely positive, with many users expressing appreciation for the site's potential to solve the problem of discovering Linux audio software, which is often scattered across the internet. However, the discussion also highlighted several key challenges and nuances of the Linux music production ecosystem.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on hardware compatibility and user interface (UI). Users inquired about support for Raspberry Pi, with the consensus being that availability is limited due to the need for ARM builds. Another user criticized the common skeuomorphic design of software knobs, arguing they are inefficient to control with a mouse, though others defended them for their compactness and similarity to physical hardware.

The discussion also branched out into broader comparisons. One user drew a parallel between the low-latency audio needs of musicians and telephony, but another user strongly refuted this, arguing that the technical requirements (latency sensitivity, compression, channel count) are fundamentally different. Finally, there was a notable debate about the quality of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) plugin interfaces, with some lamenting the lack of good design compared to commercial products, while others pointed to exceptions like Surge and Vital that have excellent UIs.

## [Swapping SIM cards used to be easy, and then came eSIM](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/)
**Score:** 209 | **Comments:** 253 | **ID:** 46421653

> **Article:** The article on Ars Technica details the author's frustrating experience with eSIM technology in 2025. While acknowledging the theoretical benefits, the author argues that the reality is often a "fiasco." Key complaints include the inability to easily transfer an eSIM to a new device without carrier approval or a working internet connection, the difficulty of porting a number to a new phone if the old one is broken or dead, and the reliance on carrier websites or apps that often fail. The author contrasts this with the simple, reliable process of moving a physical SIM card between phones, concluding that eSIM prioritizes carrier convenience and control over user freedom and reliability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deeply divided community, with experiences ranging from seamless to disastrous, largely dependent on the specific workflow and carrier involved.

A central theme is the tension between user freedom and carrier control. Many commenters argue that eSIM is a technology designed to lock users into carrier ecosystems, making it harder to switch providers or devices without carrier approval. This is seen as a deliberate move to secure business models rather than improve user experience. However, others counter that the technology itself is neutral and that manufacturers are simply implementing the GSMA spec, which includes features demanded by carriers for subsidized phone plans.

The user experience is highly polarized. On one hand, many users report that upgrading between the same ecosystem (e.g., new iPhone to new iPhone) is a seamless, automated process. The ability to instantly acquire and activate local data plans while traveling is also cited as a major, game-changing advantage. On the other hand, numerous anecdotes detail activation failures, especially when a device is broken, the initial setup fails, or when dealing with non-local carrier restrictions. One user noted the paradox of needing data to download the app needed to get data.

Finally, the discussion touches on broader trends of removing user-serviceable components, with eSIM being compared to the loss of headphone jacks and microSD card slots. While some users have accepted this trade-off for convenience, others actively seek out devices like the Sony Xperia that retain these features, voting with their wallets for user control.

## [Libgodc: Write Go Programs for Sega Dreamcast](https://github.com/drpaneas/libgodc)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46420672

> **Article:** The article introduces "libgodc," a Go runtime for the Sega Dreamcast console. Created by drpaneas, it allows developers to write programs in Go for the 1999 hardware (200MHz SH4 CPU, 16MB RAM) using standard language features like goroutines and garbage collection. The project uses the gccgo compiler, integrates with the KallistiOS homebrew SDK, and includes examples like Pong and Breakout. The author also provides extensive documentation, which is highlighted as a major strength of the project.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with strong enthusiasm, primarily praising the project's exceptionally high-quality documentation, which many users noted was better than that of major corporations. The technical discussion focused on the feasibility of running Go on such constrained hardware; users discussed the use of the gccgo compiler (which lacks generics) and compared this approach to alternatives like TinyGo or compiling to WebAssembly.

While some commenters debated the definition of "severe constraints" given the Dreamcast's power in its era, the prevailing sentiment was one of nostalgia and admiration for the engineering challenge. The conversation briefly drifted to humorous comparisons regarding modern software bloat, with one user joking about porting Microsoft Teams to the Dreamcast, before returning to the impressive nature of the port itself.

## [Nvidia takes $5B stake in Intel under September agreement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/nvidia-takes-5-billion-stake-intel-under-september-agreement-2025-12-29/)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46423010

> **Article:** Reuters reports that Nvidia has acquired a $5 billion stake in Intel. This investment is part of an agreement made in September, which will make Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, holding approximately 4% of the company following the issuance of new shares. The deal positions the dominant AI chipmaker as a major investor in its struggling competitor.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the Nvidia-Intel deal is largely skeptical and cynical, focusing on the strategic implications, the underlying economic conditions, and the feasibility of Intel's turnaround.

A central theme is the question of whether this investment can actually save Intel. Many commenters are doubtful, arguing that Intel's problems are "fundamental" and not easily solved by money. The consensus is that Intel's primary challenge is a lack of manufacturing expertise, particularly in advanced fabrication. One user memorably stated that Intel doesn't just need an EUV lithography machine, it needs a "wizard" to operate it, highlighting a critical skills gap that capital alone cannot fix.

The conversation also touches on the broader economic context. Some users see this as a sign of a "circular" flow of capital, where large companies with massive profits (like Nvidia) have few places to invest other than in each other. This was linked to Michael Burry's warnings about capital amortization and the end of easy growth, suggesting the current tech boom has underlying structural weaknesses.

Finally, there was significant discussion about the players involved and the nature of corporate ownership. Commenters clarified the list of Intel's largest shareholders, noting the US government's significant stake. The deal was also viewed by some as a strategic move by Nvidia to neutralize its "only viable AI competition." A minor philosophical debate emerged about the concept of corporate ownership, with one user questioning the utility of companies owning other companies, while another defended it as a necessary tool for limiting liability.

## [LLMs Are Not Fun](https://orib.dev/nofun.html)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 172 | **ID:** 46424136

> **Article:** The article "LLMs Are Not Fun" argues that the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in programming is stripping the craft of its joy and meaning. The author defines the joy of programming not as the act of typing, but as the deep, intellectual process of understanding a problem, designing a solution, and navigating the intricate details of a system. They contend that using LLMs to generate code bypasses this satisfying struggle, reducing a creative and fulfilling endeavor to a mundane task of prompt engineering and code review. The author expresses concern that this shift devalues the core skills of a developer and turns a passion into a joyless, mechanical process, driven more by corporate pressure for productivity than by genuine creative satisfaction.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely a direct rebuttal to the article's premise, though a significant minority expresses sympathy for the author's perspective. The dominant sentiment is that LLMs are, in fact, very fun and powerful tools that enhance the programming experience.

A primary theme among proponents is that LLMs augment, rather than replace, the enjoyable parts of programming. Many commenters argue that by automating tedious tasks like boilerplate, syntax lookups, and debugging minor errors, LLMs free them to focus on the more creative and intellectually stimulating aspects of their work: high-level design, architecture, and problem-solving. For these users, LLMs act as a force multiplier that makes ambitious side projects feasible and turns "crazy ideas" into reality, leading to more fun and creative output.

However, a crucial counter-theme revolves around the social and professional pressure to embrace AI. Several users praise the original article as "brave" for voicing an unpopular opinion, noting a pervasive pressure in the industry to not only use but also *enjoy* these tools. This ties into a deeper philosophical debate about the nature of work and meaning. One commenter posits a fundamental divide between those who value the creative *process* and those who value the *end result*, suggesting the article's author is firmly in the former camp. Another argues that the real issue is the threat to the meaning derived from mastering and executing a craft, especially when it's tied to one's livelihood.

Finally, a practical counterpoint is raised regarding code quality and control. While some concede that LLMs are fine for prototypes, others insist that production-ready code still requires significant human effort and oversight, challenging the notion that LLMs can fully replace the developer's role in ensuring correctness and maintainability.

## [Static Allocation with Zig](https://nickmonad.blog/2025/static-allocation-with-zig-kv/)
**Score:** 180 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46422009

> **Article:** The article "Static Allocation with Zig" describes a proof-of-concept key-value store written in Zig that adheres to a strict memory allocation strategy: all memory is pre-allocated at startup, and no dynamic memory allocation or freeing occurs during runtime. This approach, inspired by the "TigerStyle" guide from the TigerBeetle database project, aims to eliminate runtime allocation overhead, prevent memory-related bugs like use-after-free, and ensure predictable performance. The author demonstrates how Zig's generic allocator interface makes it idiomatic to design components that can work with different allocation strategies, allowing them to implement this static pattern cleanly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the trade-offs and context of this allocation strategy. While some commenters initially dismissed the technique as a standard practice in embedded systems, the conversation evolved to recognize its value in high-performance applications like databases. The primary motivations cited were not raw speed, but rather operational predictability (consistent latency), safety (avoiding use-after-free bugs in a language without a borrow checker), and forcing developers to define clear operational limits upfront.

Key points of debate included the practicality of imposing hard limits on memory, the role of OS features like memory overcommit, and the distinction between in-memory and file-system-backed databases. It was clarified that for a database like TigerBeetle, static allocation of in-memory buffers is separate from the total data storage, which can grow on disk. For the article's in-memory key-value store, however, this approach means accepting a fixed capacity. Overall, the community viewed the practice as a deliberate and powerful engineering choice for building robust, predictable systems, rather than a novel invention.

## [Feynman's Hughes Lectures: 950 pages of notes](https://thehugheslectures.info/the-lectures/)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46419273

> **Article:** The article links to a website hosting a complete transcription of Richard Feynman's 1983-1984 Hughes Aircraft Company lectures. These notes, spanning approximately 950 pages, cover topics in physics and were transcribed by a dedicated admirer. The content is distinct from the more famous "Feynman Lectures on Physics" given at Caltech, offering a different, though similarly comprehensive, set of insights from the renowned physicist.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response is overwhelmingly positive, with many users expressing gratitude for the resource and admiring the sheer volume and artistry of the handwritten notes. The discussion quickly pivots to a debate on Richard Feynman's enduring fame and cultural status. One commenter questions the "mystery" of Feynman's appeal, suggesting that other seminal textbooks, like Purcell's on Electromagnetism, are more influential but less celebrated. This sparked a conversation about why Feynman remains a pop-culture icon while other great physicists do not. Explanations offered include his charisma, media presence, and the digestible nature of his lectures compared to dense textbooks. The conversation also touches on the high productivity of past academics, attributing it to a less bureaucratic environment and the absence of modern distractions like programming. A clarifying comment was made to distinguish these specific Hughes lectures from the standard Caltech Feynman Lectures.

## [UK accounting body to halt remote exams amid AI cheating](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/29/uk-accounting-remote-exams-ai-cheating-acca)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46420289

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports that the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a major UK accounting body, will stop offering remote exams. The decision is a direct response to the rise of AI-powered cheating, which has made it too easy for candidates to cheat undetected. The ACCA will now require candidates to sit assessments in person, with remote options only available under "exceptional circumstances." This reverses a trend that began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when exams were moved online for convenience and accessibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the accounting body's decision, framing it as a self-serving move to protect its status as a "gatekeeper" rather than a genuine effort to ensure fairness. A central theme is that the move is primarily about protecting revenue streams, with many commenters arguing that the ACCA and similar organizations are clinging to outdated models of certification in a rapidly changing world.

Commenters broadly agree that AI has fundamentally changed the nature of cheating, making it trivial to get correct answers without any understanding of the material. However, there is a strong counter-argument that professional certifications and universities still serve a vital purpose. One side argues that AI makes certificates irrelevant because skills are what matter, while the other side contends that the real value of education is in developing abstract thinking and problem-solving abilities—skills that are lost if students outsource their learning to AI.

There is also a significant discussion on the practicalities of cheating. Some commenters share anecdotes about how easy it is to cheat in remote exams using virtual machines or other technical workarounds, while others point out that even in-person exams are not foolproof, citing examples of sophisticated cheating rings. The consensus, however, is that in-person exams are a much higher barrier to cheating than remote ones. The conversation concludes with a debate on the future of assessment, with some educators suggesting a return to non-digital, in-person exams as the only viable way to ensure academic integrity in the age of AI.

## [ManusAI Joins Meta](https://manus.im/blog/manus-joins-meta-for-next-era-of-innovation)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46426534

> **Article:** The article announces that Manus AI, a startup focused on General AI Agents, is joining Meta. The post frames the acquisition as a validation of their pioneering work and the beginning of a "next era of innovation." The specific terms and financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed in the announcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the announcement with widespread skepticism and cynicism. The dominant theme was disbelief at the acquisition's value and the nature of the company being acquired. Many commenters pointed out that the announcement's language ("validation of our pioneering work") sounded like it was generated by AI, leading to speculation that the post itself was a satirical stunt or a poorly edited press release.

There was significant confusion regarding the target company's identity and worth. Several users noted they had never heard of Manus AI, while others were shocked that Meta would acquire a startup widely perceived as a "wrapper" around existing models (like Anthropic's Claude) rather than building the capability in-house. This led to speculation that the purchase was primarily a "talent acquisition" to bring in AI experts, with one user noting the company had reached a $500 million valuation just months after launching.

The discussion also broadened into a critique of Meta's track record. Users expressed concern that Meta would "fuck this up," citing a history of botched acquisitions and stalled innovation in purchased products like Instagram and WhatsApp. A separate, highly upvoted comment used the news to launch a broader critique of Meta's societal impact, comparing the company's addictive social media products to the tobacco industry and expressing alarm at the idea of them wielding more powerful, opaque AI tools.

## [EU to build no-fee payments service like Visa/Mastercard and Apple/Google Pay](https://www.independent.ie/business/digital-euro-what-it-is-and-how-we-will-use-the-new-form-of-cash/a165973061.html)

> **Article:** The article from the Independent.ie details the European Union's plan to develop a "digital euro," a public payment infrastructure designed to function as a no-fee alternative to private card networks like Visa and Mastercard, and mobile wallets from Apple and Google. The project is framed as a strategic move to reduce Europe's dependency on US-based financial technology giants and to assert "digital sovereignty." The digital euro would be legal tender, built exclusively by European companies, and intended for everyday payments. While it would coexist with cash, it aims to provide a unified, low-cost, and widely accepted digital payment method across the Eurozone.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a complex and divided sentiment towards the EU's digital euro initiative. The conversation is anchored by several key themes:

A significant portion of the comments are highly supportive, viewing the project as a necessary step for European sovereignty and a way to counter the dominance of US tech and financial corporations. These users see it as a public good, akin to other essential infrastructure like roads and water, and a crucial move to reclaim financial power from "surveillance capitalism." There is hope that the system will prioritize privacy and learn from successful models like Brazil's PIX system.

However, a strong counter-argument focuses on privacy and the potential for government overreach. The most critical voices warn of the dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), fearing it could enable total state control, programmable money with restrictions (e.g., expiry dates, approved spending), and the ability to freeze assets of political dissidents. Others, while less extreme, express unease about the "tracking" aspect and question whether they would trust a state database more than private financial firms.

The practical implementation and feasibility of the project also sparked debate. Skeptics point out the irony of building a "European" system that still relies on American hardware (Apple/Android phones) and software (Google services), questioning its true independence. There's also a recurring argument that the EU should focus on connecting the many existing national instant payment systems rather than creating yet another standard. Comparisons were frequently drawn to existing systems in India (UPI) and Sweden (Swish), with some arguing the EU is acting too late and inefficiently.

Finally, the discussion touches on the political and economic implications. Some users express concern that this is less about consumer benefit and more about consolidating power at the EU level, further eroding the sovereignty of individual nation-states. Others counter that this is a necessary step for Europe to remain relevant globally. The debate also highlighted the tension between the stated goal of no-fee payments and existing EU regulations that prevent merchants from passing on card fees to consumers, with users questioning how the new system would be incentivized.

## [AI is forcing us to write good code](https://bits.logic.inc/p/ai-is-forcing-us-to-write-good-code)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46424200

> **Article:** The article "AI is forcing us to write good code" argues that the rise of AI coding assistants necessitates a stricter, more disciplined approach to software development. The author, from a company using AI to generate code, posits that to effectively leverage AI, developers must create an environment of "machine-readable" best practices. This includes enforcing 100% test coverage, rigorous static typing (including end-to-end type safety), zero thrown errors, and deterministic formatting. The core idea is that these constraints act as guardrails and feedback loops for the AI, making its output more reliable, testable, and maintainable. In essence, AI doesn't replace the need for good engineering; it makes it a prerequisite for success.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a polarized debate on the article's premise. A central theme is skepticism towards the author's motives, with many commenters dismissing the post as disguised marketing for the author's startup. This skepticism is amplified by a perceived lack of credibility in the author's claims, particularly the assertion of running a full test suite for hundreds of thousands of lines of code in under a second, which several engineers found unbelievable.

Beyond the credibility debate, the core ideas are contested. Supporters agree that AI is changing the value of testing, shifting it from a developer's scaffolding tool to a crucial, "reified context" for future AI interactions. They see the author's strict rules as a logical adaptation. However, critics express concern that this approach promotes a superficial understanding of engineering principles, potentially misleading junior developers. Others argue that these "good practices" were always valuable, and AI is simply making their importance more obvious. A recurring counterpoint is that the real challenge is forcing AI to write good code, not the other way around, and that the limitations of LLMs (e.g., handling genuinely new concepts) remain a significant hurdle.

## [Meta's ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ai-generating-bizarre-ads-advantage-plus-2025-10)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46424733

> **Article:** An article in Business Insider reports that Meta is using its "Advantage+" AI tool to automatically generate and swap in new ads for advertisers. The system is creating bizarre, low-quality, and sometimes nonsensical ad content without the advertiser's explicit approval. Advertisers are finding that the AI is replacing their high-performing, human-crafted ads with AI-generated variations that are often ineffective or damaging to their brand, leading to frustration and wasted ad spend.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of unsurprised cynicism, philosophical concern, and technical complaints. The prevailing sentiment is that this development is an inevitable and unwelcome evolution in advertising technology.

Many commenters expressed a lack of surprise, viewing this as a logical, if dystopian, step in Meta's pursuit of automation and profit. Some predicted even more extreme future scenarios, such as AI-generated virtual influencers becoming shills for the highest bidder. The discussion also touched on broader economic anxieties, with one user framing it as a "poison fountain" where automation, rather than creating wealth, becomes an "economic blackhole" that degrades the quality of our information environment.

A key debate emerged around the effectiveness of these AI-generated ads. While some argued that replacing proven, human-made ads with AI "junk" would lead to worse results, others countered with anecdotal evidence that bizarre, AI-generated ads might actually outperform traditional ones in terms of user engagement and conversions, a frustrating reality for those who value quality.

Finally, there were more practical points. One user raised a technical issue with the Business Insider website itself, which others confirmed. Another commenter argued against the idea that everyone hates ads, suggesting that if they were truly universally despised, democratic processes would have outlawed them by now. The overall conclusion was that this trend is pushing more users toward ad-blockers and paywalls, which some now prefer as a more honest transaction.
