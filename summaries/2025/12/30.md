# Hacker News Summary - 2025-12-30

## [Google is dead. Where do we go now?](https://www.circusscientist.com/2025/12/29/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/)
**Score:** 993 | **Comments:** 793 | **ID:** 46425198

> **Article:** The article, written by the operator of a small entertainment agency in South Africa, laments the decline of Google AdWords as an effective marketing tool. The author details a sharp drop in lead quality and quantity from their AdWords campaigns, despite increasing their budget. They argue that Google's focus has shifted away from its search network, which was ideal for connecting small businesses with customers actively searching for specific services. The post concludes by asking other small business owners where they should turn for advertising now that Google is "dead" for their purposes.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on the article's premise that Google AdWords is failing small businesses, with commenters exploring the broader context of this decline. Many agree that the effectiveness of targeted search advertising has diminished, attributing it to a combination of click fraud, rising costs, and a general shift in user behavior away from traditional search engines. It's noted that people are increasingly discovering products and services through social media platforms like TikTok rather than search queries.

A significant portion of the conversation links the decline of AdWords to the larger decay of the "open web." Commenters suggest that as AI models consume web content and platforms keep users within their own ecosystems, the incentive to create the kind of public, indexable content that search engines rely on is disappearing. This raises concerns about the future of search itself, even for alternative providers like Kagi, which depend on crawling the open web.

While some pointed out that Google's corporate financial health is the opposite of "dead," it was clarified that the article was specifically about the AdWords platform. The discussion also touched on the nature of online advertising, with some defending the model as an honest way to connect with customers, while others shared anecdotes about their own negative experiences. Ultimately, the conversation reflects a broader anxiety about the changing internet landscape and the lack of clear, viable alternatives for small businesses trying to reach customers online.

## [Netflix Open Content](https://opencontent.netflix.com/)
**Score:** 504 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46431560

> **Article:** The article links to the Netflix Open Content page, a repository of technical test content used internally by Netflix to test their media pipelines. The content consists of clips from Netflix productions (like "Squid Game") and other footage, made available for download to help partners and the open-source community test and develop codecs and media software. The project appears to be largely inactive, with the last update noted in 2020.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the perceived neglect and low quality of the Netflix Open Content page. Users quickly noted that the site hasn't been updated since 2020 and criticized its technical shortcomings, specifically the lack of an SSL certificate (using plain HTTP) and the fact that all internal links are routed through Google's URL shortener for tracking. Commenters speculated that the project was likely an internal initiative that lost funding or interest, describing the site as looking like a "pet project" or a "free template" with "zero effort."

Beyond critiquing the site itself, users debated the broader state of online video. One thread lamented that streaming is a "regression" compared to physical media, lacking features like director commentaries and behind-the-scenes content. Another user pointed to a more recent and active initiative, the Academy Software Foundation's Digital Production Example Library (DPEL), as a better example of industry collaboration. The conversation also touched on Netflix's motivation, with users concluding it's a strategic move to encourage better codecs, which in turn reduces Netflix's own bandwidth costs.

## [Stranger Things creator says turn off “garbage” settings](https://screenrant.com/stranger-things-creator-turn-off-settings-premiere/)
**Score:** 365 | **Comments:** 651 | **ID:** 46427586

> **Article:** The article references comments from the creator of "Stranger Things," the Duffer Brothers, advising viewers to turn off "garbage" settings on their modern televisions. Specifically, the creators urge audiences to disable features like motion smoothing (often called the "soap opera effect"), dynamic contrast, and other post-processing enhancements. They argue that these settings ruin the intended cinematic look of the show, which was carefully color-graded to match the 1980s film aesthetic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the sentiment that modern TV settings degrade picture quality, but it diverges on the philosophy of user control versus artistic intent.

Most commenters confirm that manufacturers enable aggressive post-processing (such as motion smoothing and over-saturated colors) primarily to make TVs stand out in bright retail environments, often at the expense of the director's vision. Users frequently noted that these settings introduce input lag and destroy the "film look." There was a consensus on the utility of "Filmmaker Mode"—a standardized setting that disables processing—but skepticism regarding its implementation and availability across different devices.

However, a significant counter-argument emerged regarding user autonomy. Several users argued that while they personally dislike "soap opera" effects, viewers should be free to adjust their settings to suit their environment or visual preferences. One commenter noted that "cinema modes" are often too dark for a living room with ambient light, and that asking users to change their viewing environment to match the director's intent is unrealistic. The discussion concluded with the idea that TVs should ship with processing turned off by default (opt-in), allowing users to enable features only if they prefer them, rather than forcing "enhancements" on everyone.

## [I migrated to an almost all-EU stack and saved 500€ per year](https://www.zeitgeistofbytes.com/p/bye-bye-big-tech-how-i-migrated-to)
**Score:** 309 | **Comments:** 226 | **ID:** 46427582

> **Article:** The article details the author's journey to migrate their personal tech stack away from major US-based providers (like Google, AWS, and Apple) to European alternatives. Motivated by a desire for better privacy, data sovereignty, and to avoid US surveillance capitalism, the author aimed to find services that are GDPR-compliant and based in the EU. The migration resulted in a modest financial saving of approximately €500 per year. The new stack includes services like Infomaniak for cloud and office needs, Hetzner for web hosting, Proton for secure communication, and Vivaldi for browsing. The author acknowledges that while some services are excellent (Hetzner, Infomaniak), others have trade-offs, such as Proton's mail search functionality. The overall conclusion is that switching is feasible and aligns with their values, even if the cost savings aren't dramatic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community had a multifaceted reaction to the article, centering on the practicality, cost, and philosophy of de-googling.

A primary point of contention was the author's claim that Substack has no viable alternatives, with several users immediately pointing out platforms like Hyvor Blogs and Beehiiv. This sparked a debate about the specific features of Substack, which combines blogging with a social network and subscription service, making it harder to replace with a single tool.

The financial aspect of the migration was heavily debated. One user detailed their own switch from a paid Proton plan to a free tier combined with a cheap self-hosted server to maintain a sub-$10/month budget, highlighting the trade-off between money and time. This frugality was contrasted with others who felt a €10 budget was unrealistic. The value proposition of established ecosystems like Google Workspace was defended by a user who found its features and storage for ~€15/month unbeatable, though others countered by suggesting cheaper European alternatives like Infomaniak's kSuite. A recurring theme was the idea of paying for privacy rather than paying with data.

The discussion also explored different philosophies for escaping ecosystem lock-in. While the author chose to move to another ecosystem (Proton), some users advocated for a more decentralized approach: owning one's domain for email, using best-in-class FOSS apps (like Bitwarden), and self-hosting core services like calendars and contacts to maintain ultimate control. The feasibility and resource intensity of self-hosting platforms like NextCloud were questioned, with some finding it too demanding for low-power hardware.

Finally, there was a broader conversation about the "walled gardens" of big tech. An Apple user defended their choice as a privacy-conscious compromise, but was challenged on Apple's own restrictive ecosystem. The debate also touched on the nature of data monetization, with one user pushing back against the blanket statement that "everything" on Google is logged for profit, while others maintained a deep skepticism of Big Tech's business models. Ultimately, the discussion revealed a spectrum of approaches, from full self-hosting to carefully selecting alternative service providers, all driven by a desire for more control and privacy.

## [Nicolas Guillou, French ICC judge sanctioned by the US and “debanked”](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/19/nicolas-guillou-french-icc-judge-sanctioned-by-the-us-you-are-effectively-blacklisted-by-much-of-the-world-s-banking-system_6747628_4.html)
**Score:** 304 | **Comments:** 299 | **ID:** 46432057

> **Article:** The article from Le Monde details how Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), has been sanctioned by the United States. This sanction has resulted in Guillou being "debanked," effectively cutting him off from much of the global banking system. The US sanctions are linked to the ICC's investigations into alleged war crimes committed by US allies, specifically Israel, in the Palestinian territories. The piece highlights the significant personal and professional pressure this places on an international jurist and questions the use of human rights sanction mechanisms against individuals who are themselves upholding international law. It frames the situation as a major clash between the US's unilateral power and the international legal order.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the US sanctions, viewing them as an abuse of power that undermines the rule of law and international institutions. A central theme is the hypocrisy of using a human rights sanctions framework against judges of a court designed to prosecute human rights violations. Many commenters see this as a clear example of American soft power eroding, with the US acting like "gangsters" to protect its allies, which in turn pushes other nations to seek alternatives to the US-dominated financial system.

The conversation also touches on broader geopolitical trends. Several users argue that such actions are not new but are a continuation of US foreign policy using human rights as a pretext for advancing its own interests. There is a strong sentiment that this behavior delegitimizes the "rules-based order," reducing international law to a tool of foreign policy. While a minority of comments defend the US position by pointing out that it doesn't recognize the ICC's jurisdiction, the overwhelming consensus is that this is a dangerous precedent that weakens global legal norms and American credibility.

## [Non-Zero-Sum Games](https://nonzerosum.games/)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46432311

> **Article:** The linked website, "Non-Zero-Sum Games," is a collection of essays exploring concepts from game theory and applying them to social dynamics, philosophy, and personal development. The site uses interactive visualizations and a distinct, whimsical design to explain complex ideas. Key topics include the benefits of cooperation over defection (framed through the Prisoner's Dilemma), critiques of zero-sum thinking in areas like capitalism and affirmative action, and nuanced discussions on concepts like meritocracy versus "effortocracy." The central theme is that many of society's problems can be reframed and potentially solved by moving away from zero-sum mindsets and seeking positive-sum, cooperative outcomes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is sharply divided into two main camps: those praising the website's design and those critiquing its usability, followed by a substantive debate on the core concepts presented.

A significant portion of the comments focus on the site's aesthetic and user experience. Many users found the design "very pretty," "genius," and a welcome departure from generic "AI slop." However, an equal or greater number found the design actively hostile to readability, citing issues like a "comic sans" like typeface, poor contrast (white text on dark backgrounds), small font size, and distracting animations that hindered skimming.

The philosophical discussion centered on the site's content. A key debate emerged around the viability of cooperation versus defection. One commenter argued that in the real world, cheating is a "superior strategy" because people are forgiving of abusers and it's easy to start over, suggesting morality is an irrational disadvantage. This was countered by several users who argued that civilization and prosperity are fundamentally built on vast, multi-layered cooperation, and that the system can only withstand a certain level of cheating before collapsing. Another user pointed out that cooperation is a long-term stable evolutionary strategy, suggesting its power is often overlooked because it's so pervasive.

Other debates touched on the site's specific arguments:
*   **Affirmative Action:** A user argued the site's take was flawed, as AA creates a zero-sum game for fixed resources like university slots. The counter-argument was that the "meritocracy" it seeks to correct is already a zero-sum game skewed by historical and generational advantages like legacy admissions.
*   **Capitalism:** A user asserted capitalism is inherently zero-sum due to finite resources and uncounted externalities like pollution, directly challenging a theme from one of the articles.
*   **Effortocracy:** A discussion on the site's article about "effortocracy" questioned whether effort has intrinsic moral value, especially if it's futile, distinguishing it from actual achievement.

## [Go away Python](https://lorentz.app/blog-item.html?id=go-shebang)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 257 | **ID:** 46431028

> **Article:** The article "Go away Python" proposes using Go for shell scripting via a clever shebang hack. The author demonstrates a method to create executable Go scripts that compile and run on-the-fly without needing a pre-configured Go module. The technique involves starting a Go file with a shell command disguised as a comment: `///usr/bin/env go run "$0" "$@"; exit`. The triple slash `///` is valid Go syntax (a single-line comment followed by a `//` that the shell interprets as a comment), which allows the rest of the file to be standard Go code. The author argues this makes Go a viable alternative to Python for scripting, citing benefits like static binaries, performance, and avoiding Python's virtual environment complexities.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a split between those who appreciate the cleverness of the hack and those who question its practicality. The core debate centers on language "ergonomics" for scripting. One commenter articulates a distinction between "scriptable" languages (like Bash, Python, Ruby) designed for quick, throwaway tasks, and "shippable" languages (like Go, Rust) that encourage formal engineering practices like testing and release pipelines. While some users share positive experiences with Go's reliability ("once things compile, they run"), others argue that the overhead and verbosity of Go make it a poor fit for scripting compared to languages with more dynamic features.

Several technical improvements and alternatives were suggested:
*   **Correcting Exit Codes:** A user pointed out that the original script should use `exit $?` to pass the program's exit code back to the shell.
*   **Portability:** Another suggested using `///usr/bin/env go run "$0" "$@"; exit` for better portability across systems.
*   **Modern Python Tooling:** A major counterpoint was that modern Python tools like `uv` have solved the dependency and environment issues the author cited, allowing for similar shebang-based script execution with PyPI dependencies.
*   **Other Languages:** Commenters noted that similar shebang capabilities exist for other languages like C (with `tcc`), C# (.NET), and Java.

Overall, the community treated the article as an interesting technical curiosity, but the consensus leaned towards Go's design philosophy being fundamentally misaligned with the ad-hoc nature of scripting, despite the hack's technical viability.

## [HSBC blocks its app due to F-Droid-installed Bitwarden](https://mastodon.neilzone.co.uk/@neil/115807834298031971)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 204 | **ID:** 46431453

> **Article:** The article, shared via a Mastodon post, details a user's experience where the HSBC banking app blocked access on their Android device. The block was triggered because the user had Bitwarden, a password manager, installed via F-Droid (an alternative app store). The app's detection of software outside the official Google Play ecosystem, or specific permissions held by the password manager (like overlaying the screen), caused HSBC's security measures to flag the device as potentially compromised, preventing the user from accessing their bank account.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the conflict between user control over their devices and banks' increasing demands for a locked-down, controlled environment for security. The consensus is that while banks' fears of malware are understandable, their methods are often overly aggressive and alienate tech-savvy users.

Key points of the discussion include:
*   **The Security Rationale:** Some users acknowledge the bank's perspective, suggesting the block was likely triggered by Bitwarden's "overlay" permission, which could be used by malware to create a fake login screen. This is seen as a reasonable, if blunt, risk-management strategy from the bank's point of view.
*   **User Control vs. Security Theater:** A major theme is the loss of user autonomy. Many commenters argue that banks are infringing on their "property" by dictating what software can be installed. Several users dismiss these checks as "security theatre," arguing that they don't actually prevent the most common threats, like scams and social engineering, while effectively punishing power users.
*   **Technical Workarounds and Bank Policies:** The conversation delves into the technical side, with users explaining that HSBC uses the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission (approved by Google for financial apps) to scan for other apps. They also mention that developer mode or rooted devices are often blocked. However, some point to banks like Monzo as a better model, which warns users of potential risks but ultimately allows them to proceed.
*   **Broader Implications of "De-banking":** The discussion expands beyond app compatibility to the wider issue of financial control. One user raised concerns about "de-banking" due to political or regulatory pressures, which sparked a debate about the need for judicial oversight before financial services can be revoked.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** Several solutions were offered by users. These include switching to banks with more lenient policies, using a separate "burner" phone for banking apps, isolating the banking app in a work profile, or abandoning apps altogether in favor of robust web-based banking. The introduction of Android's Protected Confirmation (using the TrustZone) was also suggested as a more secure alternative that doesn't require blocking other apps.

## [Public Sans – A strong, neutral typeface](https://public-sans.digital.gov/)
**Score:** 216 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46433579

> **Article:** The article links to the official page for "Public Sans," a free, open-source typeface developed by the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) and the General Services Administration (GSA). It is described as a "strong, neutral" sans-serif font designed for clarity and readability in user interfaces and body text. The site provides details on its design principles, technical specifications, and offers downloads and resources for developers and designers. The font is positioned as a robust, public-domain alternative for government and general web use.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive but delves into specific design details and comparisons. The initial comments clarify the font's origin, noting it predates recent controversies over fonts like Calibri and was a project by 18F and the USWDS.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on font legibility, particularly the differentiation between similar characters (glyphs). One user criticizes Public Sans for its capital 'I' lacking serifs, which they find frustrating, and champions IBM Plex Sans for its superior character distinction. This sparked a sub-thread recommending other highly legible open-source fonts like Inter and Atkinson Hyperlegible.

Users also compare Public Sans to other popular fonts. It's noted for its resemblance to Microsoft's Aptos and its relationship to Franklin Gothic/Libre Franklin, with some finding it a "neutered" version of the latter. A direct comparison with Roboto leads to the conclusion that the choice between them is largely preferential, as they are functionally similar.

The discussion concludes with a mix of political commentary regarding the current state of government digital services and a lighthearted debate on the meaning of the font's description "strong and neutral."

## [Hacking Washing Machines [video]](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-hacking-washing-machines)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46428496

> **Article:** The article is a video presentation from the Chaos Communication Congress (39c3) titled "Hacking Washing Machines." The researchers detail their process of reverse-engineering and finding vulnerabilities in modern smart appliances from major brands like Miele and BSH (Bosch/Siemens). They explore various attack vectors, including Wi-Fi connectivity, debug ports, and an unusual optical communication system used by Miele for diagnostics. The presentation covers the technical methods used to gain control over the machines' functions, highlighting the security implications of connected IoT devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the washing machine hacking video is largely positive and curious, with several key themes emerging. The most praised aspect was the collaborative and productive relationship between the security researchers and the manufacturers, BSH and Miele, who proactively engaged to fix the vulnerabilities. This was seen as a model for responsible disclosure.

Technically, the community was particularly fascinated by the Miele washing machine's use of an optical (infrared) communication port. Commenters quickly identified its primary benefit as electrical isolation, which is crucial for safety in a device with high-voltage mains power. This led to a side discussion comparing it to older technologies like IrDA, which was noted for its simplicity and robustness in such environments.

The conversation also branched out into broader topics related to smart appliances:
*   **The Value of Connectivity:** While some users expressed skepticism about the need for Wi-Fi in a washing machine, others pointed out practical benefits like receiving notifications when a cycle finishes. A key consensus was that local-only modes for offline functionality are essential.
*   **Fear of "Smart" Features:** A recurring concern was the trend of appliances requiring an internet connection to function, with users hoping for legislation that would mandate offline operation.
*   **Nostalgia for Simplicity:** Several comments reminisced about older, purely electro-mechanical machines that were easier to diagnose and repair, contrasting them with the complexity of modern smart devices.
*   **Humor and Tangents:** The discussion included lighthearted comments about door lock mechanisms (wax motors vs. solenoids), the use of the Forth programming language in appliances, and humorous sci-fi scenarios of maliciously hacked laundry.

## [Show HN: Stop Claude Code from forgetting everything](https://github.com/mutable-state-inc/ensue-skill)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 208 | **ID:** 46426624

> **Project:** This is a tool called "Ensue Skill" designed to solve the context and memory problem for AI coding assistants, specifically Claude Code. The project provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that hooks into Claude sessions to store conversations, thoughts, and notes. Instead of relying on summaries or a single session's context window, it builds a structured, semantic "hypergraph" of the work. This allows developers to query their past reasoning, research threads, and design decisions days later, effectively giving the AI a persistent, external memory that survives across sessions and tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to the project was a mix of genuine interest and skepticism about complexity. Proponents described it as a solution for long research sessions where context is lost between days, allowing them to ask questions like "what was I actually trying to fix here?" and retrieve past reasoning. A key point of clarification was that the tool's value extends beyond just preventing an AI from "forgetting"; it aims to solve context fragmentation across different tools (e.g., switching from Claude to Cursor or Codex) and agents.

However, several commenters questioned the necessity of such a tool. Some argued that native features like a detailed `CLAUDE.md` file or simply continuing and compacting sessions are sufficient. A recurring sentiment was that the ecosystem of AI tools (skills, agents, hooks) is becoming overwhelmingly complex, with one user advising that "complicated AI set ups are mid curve." A significant practical concern was data privacy, with users asking for a self-hosted option to avoid sending proprietary code to a third-party server. The developer responded that they are open to shaping this next, acknowledging it's a common request.

## [No strcpy either](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/12/29/no-strcpy-either/)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46433029

> **Article:** The article by Daniel Sternberg (author of curl) announces the removal of `strcpy` from the curl codebase. He explains that `strcpy` is a "honeypot" for AI-generated vulnerability reports, which often hallucinate buffer overflows where none exist. To replace it, the team introduced a custom function, `curlx_strcopy`, which takes the destination buffer size and source string length to perform a safe copy. However, this function returns `void` and relies on `DEBUGASSERT` to catch errors, rather than returning an error code. The post concludes that while removing `strcpy` doesn't make the code memory-safe, it significantly reduces the noise from automated security scanners.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focused on the implications of removing `strcpy` and the broader issue of AI-generated security reports. A major theme was the frustration with "AI slop"—low-quality, hallucinated vulnerability reports that waste maintainer time. While some commenters noted that high-quality AI analyzers do exist and have found real bugs, the consensus was that careless AI use for bug bounties is a significant problem.

The technical implementation of the new `curlx_strcopy` function was heavily debated. Several users criticized its design, particularly the `void` return type and its behavior of silently truncating or emptying the destination buffer on failure. They argued that an explicit error code would be a safer and more robust API.

Finally, the conversation broadened to the general state of string handling in C. Commenters discussed the historical purpose of functions like `strncpy` and suggested that modern solutions, such as libraries that track string length alongside the pointer, are a better long-term approach.

## [Win32 is the stable Linux ABI](https://loss32.org/)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46433035

> **Article:** The article "Win32 is the stable Linux ABI" argues that the Win32 API has effectively become the most stable and reliable Application Binary Interface (ABI) for Linux development. The author posits that while the Linux kernel's internal ABI is notoriously unstable and changes frequently, the Wine/Proton compatibility layer provides a consistent, long-term supported bridge between Windows applications and the Linux kernel. By targeting the Win32 API, developers can create applications that run on Linux via Wine/Proton without being broken by kernel updates, glibc changes, or desktop environment shifts. The piece suggests this is a reversal of the traditional expectation that native Linux APIs would be the stable target, and that the Win32 layer, driven by the need for Windows game compatibility on platforms like the Steam Deck, has achieved a level of stability that native Linux development lacks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely centered on the validity of the article's premise and the definition of a "stable ABI." A key point of contention is whether the Win32 API, which is a high-level API, can be considered an ABI, which is typically a low-level binary contract. Many commenters argue that the article conflates the two, and that the actual stable ABI is the Linux kernel syscall interface, which is extremely stable and guaranteed not to break user-space applications. The instability developers face, they argue, comes from higher-level libraries and desktop environments, not the kernel itself.

There is also significant debate about the practicality of this approach. While proponents point to the success of Proton and Wine for games and specific applications, many others highlight the downsides, such as performance overhead, lack of integration with native Linux features (like package managers and system services), and the general clunkiness of running Windows apps. The discussion also touches on the philosophical aspect: some see this as a pragmatic solution to a real problem (Linux's lack of a stable, universal API), while others view it as a "cop-out" that avoids fixing the underlying issues in the native Linux ecosystem. The conversation concludes that while the Win32 ABI via Wine is a remarkably stable *target* for certain use cases, it's not a general-purpose replacement for native development, and the claim that the Linux kernel itself lacks a stable ABI is technically incorrect.

## [Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts](https://hsu.cy/2025/12/times-new-american/)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46432862

> **Article:** The article "Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts" examines the recent decision by the U.S. State Department to revert its official documents from Calibri (15pt) back to Times New Roman (14pt). The author frames this not merely as a design choice but as a political act, noting that the change was justified by the current administration as a move away from "wasteful diversity" and "DEI" initiatives. The article contrasts the two fonts: Calibri, designed in 2006 for screen legibility and modern digital spacing, and Times New Roman, a 1930s newspaper font that is often criticized today for being a default, uninspired choice with poor spacing on digital screens. The author suggests that while neither font is perfect, the reasoning behind the switch is more significant than the aesthetic outcome.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely critical of the State Department's rationale, though opinions on the fonts themselves were mixed. The central theme was the politicization of the decision. Many commenters viewed the "anti-DEI" justification as absurd and a sign of performative culture war posturing, with one user noting the irony of attacking a font for accessibility features. The discussion split into three main areas:

First, there was a debate on typography and accessibility. Several users defended Calibri for its screen legibility and benefits for readers with dyslexia, while others argued that serif fonts like Times New Roman are traditionally better for long-form reading in print. A representative from LucasFonts (Calibri's designer) provided a detailed technical defense of Calibri, highlighting its superior spacing and digital optimization compared to the "outdated" Times New Roman.

Second, users discussed the practical and aesthetic merits of the fonts. Calibri was described by one user as looking like a "leasing office" document, while Times New Roman was criticized for being a lazy default that signals a lack of thought. Alternatives like Palatino, Garamond, and the government's own "Public Sans" were suggested as superior choices.

Finally, there was a meta-discussion about the nature of the debate itself. Some commenters pushed back against political "flamebait," while others argued that the context was essential to understanding the story. The consensus was that a simple font change became a controversy due to the administration's need to frame it as a rejection of "woke" culture, turning a mundane bureaucratic decision into a political spectacle.

## [Approachable Swift Concurrency](https://fuckingapproachableswiftconcurrency.com/en/)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46432916

> **Article:** The article "Approachable Swift Concurrency" aims to demystify Swift's modern concurrency features, including `async/await`, actors, and structured concurrency. It provides a practical guide for developers, likely moving from basic concepts to more advanced patterns, with the goal of making the topic feel less intimidating and more accessible. The title itself suggests a direct, no-nonsense approach to a complex subject.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the practical and philosophical aspects of concurrency. A central point of debate is the nature of `async/await`. One commenter clarifies that it's a mechanism for suspending and resuming work on the *same* thread by default, which is distinct from traditional multithreading. However, another counters that most modern languages, including Swift, use work-stealing schedulers that *do* move tasks between threads, making the single-threaded model an uncommon case in practice.

The conversation also explores the challenges of truly understanding concurrency. One user shares a pragmatic framework for reasoning about code: identify what can run simultaneously, what must be ordered, and what happens if a function suspends at a critical moment. This highlights a common feeling that concurrency remains "fragile" and that true mastery often comes from experience and "scars" rather than just theory.

A significant portion of the discussion is dedicated to comparing Swift's syntax and features with other languages. The Swift `async/await` example is praised for its clean, sequential appearance compared to Go's more verbose, error-handling-heavy style. However, this "sequential illusion" is also criticized by one developer who finds it makes the true, non-linear execution flow harder to reason about in complex scenarios. There is also criticism of Swift's own terminology ("actor," "task") as being overly complex and "shoehorned" into the language, though others defend it as a necessary evolution and point to the separate `swift-distributed-actors` project for more advanced use cases. Overall, the discussion reflects a mix of appreciation for Swift's elegance, frustration with its complexity, and a shared search for reliable mental models to build bug-free concurrent systems.

## [The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network](https://subseacables.blogspot.com/2025/12/the-british-empires-resilient-subsea.html)
**Score:** 115 | **Comments:** 30 | **ID:** 46432999

> **Article:** The article, "The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network," details the vast subsea telegraph network that connected the British Empire. This system, often referred to as the "All Red Line" due to the territories it connected on maps, was a marvel of 19th and early 20th-century engineering. The network's resilience was crucial for imperial communication, governance, and commerce. The piece likely explores the technical challenges, the materials used (such as gutta-percha for insulation), and the strategic importance of this global infrastructure, which served as the world's first "internet."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users sharing personal connections to the history and recommending further reading. The conversation can be grouped into a few key themes:

*   **Personal Anecdotes and Sightseeing:** Several commenters shared stories of visiting historical sites related to the telegraph network. These include the PK Porthcurno Telegraph Museum in the UK, the cable landing station on Valentia Island in Ireland, and the surprising origin of Alice Springs in Australia, which was established as a repeater station for the overland telegraph line connecting to the undersea cables.

*   **Further Reading and Media:** A strong consensus emerged around two key resources. The book *The Victorian Internet* by Tom Standage is recommended multiple times for its exploration of how the telegraph revolutionized society, introducing concepts like privacy and simultaneity. Neal Stephenson's 1996 *Wired* article, "Mother Earth, Mother Board," is also heavily promoted as a fascinating deep dive into the engineering and history of undersea cables.

*   **Technical and Historical Details:** Users added interesting facts, such as the use of Gutta-Percha as a natural thermoplastic for cable insulation and the unfortunate environmental impact of harvesting it. Others discussed the concept of latency in these early networks, which relied on human operators and repeater stations to forward Morse code signals.

*   **Broader Context:** The network is framed as the "original internet," a precursor to our modern digital world, with commenters drawing parallels between the engineers and inventors of that era and today's technologists.

## [Charm Ruby – Glamorous Terminal Libraries for Ruby](https://charm-ruby.dev/)
**Score:** 113 | **Comments:** 17 | **ID:** 46430558

> **Article:** The article announces Charm Ruby, a new set of libraries that port Charmbracelet's popular Go-based TUI (Text User Interface) libraries, like Bubble Tea, to the Ruby ecosystem. The goal is to bring the "glamorous" and modern terminal UI aesthetics that Charm is known for to Ruby developers, making it easier and more fun to build beautiful command-line applications in a language many already love.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with overwhelmingly positive sentiment, with developers who are fans of both Charm and Ruby expressing excitement. The discussion highlights a few key themes:

*   **Filling a Gap:** Multiple commenters noted that Ruby's TUI ecosystem was underdeveloped compared to Go's, and they are thrilled to have a modern, high-quality library available in their preferred language.
*   **API Design and Idiomatic Ruby:** A central point of debate was the library's API design. One commenter critiqued it for not feeling "idiomatic" or "eloquent" enough for Ruby, suggesting it could better leverage the language's unique features like metaprogramming. The library's creator, Marco Roth, acknowledged this, explaining that the initial release is a direct port of the Go APIs to get something out quickly and that improving the API to be more Ruby-like is a key goal for future development.
*   **Community and Collaboration:** The tone was highly collaborative. Commenters shared related projects (like a Ratatui wrapper), offered specific feature ideas (such as CSS-like layouts), and praised the creator for his work and recent recognition as a Rails Luminary.
*   **TUI Philosophy:** A minor point of discussion touched on the design philosophy of Charm, with one user questioning if its GUI-like elements (popovers, buttons) are the most efficient for keyboard-driven terminal use.

## [AI employees don't pay taxes](https://alec.is/posts/ai-employees-dont-pay-taxes/)
**Score:** 107 | **Comments:** 172 | **ID:** 46426596

> **Article:** The article "AI employees don't pay taxes" argues that replacing human workers with AI creates a critical flaw in the capitalist model. The author posits that human labor is not just a cost to be minimized, but the primary source of consumer demand, as workers use their wages to buy goods and services, and their taxes fund the government. If AI displaces a significant portion of the workforce, this cycle breaks: there will be fewer consumers with money to spend and a shrinking tax base to fund social safety nets. The author dismisses the "AI is just a tool" defense by arguing that unlike previous technologies (like tractors) that augmented labor, AI aims to replace the mind, and the speed of this displacement is unprecedented. The article concludes that without a radical shift, such as nationalizing AI companies or implementing massive taxation on them, the economy will collapse.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly polarized, with many commenters challenging the article's premises and conclusions. A central theme is the debate over whether AI is a unique threat or just the latest in a long line of technological displacements (like tractors or cars replacing horses). Skeptics question the author's "30% displacement" figure and argue that AI is also creating new jobs, suggesting the "math" isn't as dire as portrayed.

The conversation then pivots to solutions, primarily Universal Basic Income (UBI). Several users argue that UBI is politically and practically unfeasible, citing public resistance to "handouts" and the complexities of means-testing. However, others counter that means-testing is inefficient and that UBI is the most direct solution. A distinct alternative proposed is public ownership of AI infrastructure, either through government-run cloud services or by distributing shares of AI companies to citizens, effectively turning the public into owners who benefit from the automation.

Finally, a significant portion of the discussion re-frames the problem entirely. One commenter introduces the concept of "techno-feudalism," arguing the issue isn't capitalism's failure but its evolution into a system where value comes not from production but from owning the means of production (e.g., cloud platforms, AI models) and renting them out. Another user suggests the inevitable outcome is communism, as a purely automated economy without consumers or a tax base is unsustainable. The debate also touches on the fundamental nature of corporations, with some asserting that they will never voluntarily support UBI and will always seek to avoid taxes, necessitating government intervention.

## [MongoDB Server Security Update, December 2025](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/news/mongodb-server-security-update-december-2025)
**Score:** 103 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46427920

> **Article:** MongoDB published a security update for a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-57318, nicknamed "MongoBleed") affecting its server software. The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that could lead to a crash or remote code execution. The timeline indicates the issue was internally detected on Dec 12, a CVE was published on Dec 19, and a patch was released on Dec 23. The company emphasized that this was an internal discovery and that the vulnerability does not constitute a breach of MongoDB's own systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on three main themes: the timeline of the disclosure, the security implications of running MongoDB, and the general reliability of the database.

Regarding the disclosure timeline, users questioned the four-day gap between the CVE publication and the patch release. Speculation ranged from the difficulty of developing the fix and internal incident response procedures to the reduced staffing typical of the holiday season. There was also skepticism regarding MongoDB's phrasing that the vulnerability was "discovered internally," with users debating whether this meant a code audit or the detection of an active exploit.

The conversation frequently returned to the practice of exposing databases to the internet. While some users pointed out that thousands of MongoDB instances are publicly accessible (citing Shodan results), the consensus was that doing so is a severe security risk. This led to a recurring debate about MongoDB's viability versus alternatives like PostgreSQL, with some users defending MongoDB's improvements and specific use cases, while others remained critical of the software and the company's cloud offering (Atlas).
