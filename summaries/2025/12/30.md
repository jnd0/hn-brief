**Score:** 1007 | **Comments:** 881 | **ID:** 46419970

> **Article:** The article "Kidnapped by Deutsche Bahn" is a personal narrative detailing a disastrous travel experience on the German railway system. The author describes a journey that involved multiple cancellations, significant delays, and confusing rerouting. The titular "kidnapping" occurred when the author was placed on a substitute train that, instead of taking them to their destination, transported them to a different city. The train then refused to stop at their intended station due to a bureaucratic rule (the stop not being on the official schedule for that specific train), forcing them to travel 60km past their destination before they could get off. The author expresses frustration with the lack of information, poor communication from staff, and the inflexibility of the system, contrasting the reality of German rail with its perceived international reputation for efficiency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion evolved into a broad, comparative debate on the state of European rail systems, with Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the UK's National Rail as the primary case studies. While many commenters confirmed the author's experience, describing DB as increasingly unreliable and normalizing long delays, the conversation quickly branched out.

A significant portion of the discussion compared German and British railways. Commenters noted that while the UK has its own severe problems with delays, cancellations, and prohibitively expensive "airline-style" pricing, it has a silver lining in the form of robust consumer protections like "Delay Repay" (automatic refunds for delays) and good customer service. In contrast, DB was perceived as having poor customer service and less reliable compensation mechanisms. The debate also touched on the underlying causes, with some blaming government underfunding and privatization (especially in the UK), while others pointed to operational issues like overloaded infrastructure in Germany.

There was a notable split in opinion on the severity of the problem. Some commenters, particularly those with experience in the US, defended DB, arguing that German expectations for perfection are unrealistic and that the system is still far superior to American alternatives. They suggested that many complaints stem from minor, unpredictable inconveniences. However, others, including residents of other European countries like Italy and the Netherlands, shared similar negative experiences, indicating the problem may be more widespread. The role of staff, language barriers for tourists, and the need for financial incentives for reliability (similar to airline compensation rules) were also highlighted as key issues.

## [Google is dead. Where do we go now?](https://www.circusscientist.com/2025/12/29/google-is-dead-where-do-we-go-now/)
**Score:** 715 | **Comments:** 614 | **ID:** 46425198

> **Article:** The article, written by the operator of a small entertainment agency in South Africa, laments the decline of Google AdWords as an effective marketing tool. The author notes that while AdWords was once a primary source of leads, its performance has severely degraded. The post highlights several issues: a dramatic increase in cost-per-click, a significant drop in conversion rates, and a suspicion of click fraud. The author concludes that the platform is no longer viable for their small business and poses the question to readers: "Where do we go now?" for effective online advertising.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion offers a multifaceted reaction to the article, touching on the state of the ad market, the broader health of the open web, and potential alternatives.

A central theme is the debate over whether Google is truly "dead." Many commenters point out that from a financial perspective, the company is thriving. However, others clarify that the article's focus is specifically on the decline of AdWords as a useful tool for small businesses, not the company's overall health.

There is a strong consensus that the advertising landscape has fundamentally changed. Some express satisfaction with the demise of a system they felt was a "scam" prone to click fraud and inflated costs. They express hope that AI could level the playing field for businesses based on merit rather than ad spend. However, the optimism is tempered by a widespread concern that the "open web" itself is dying, killed by the rise of walled gardens like social media apps and AI platforms that consume content but don't drive traffic back to creators. This is seen as a root cause for the failure of ad platforms that depend on an active open web.

Alternative platforms are discussed with skepticism. While Kagi is mentioned as a potential successor to traditional search, commenters argue it is ultimately dependent on the same decaying open web infrastructure. The idea of moving ad spend to social media platforms like TikTok is met with resistance from users who want to keep those spaces "ad-free."

Anecdotal evidence from other users supports the article's premise, with one commenter noting their own group now finds all travel and leisure information through social media apps, bypassing traditional search engines entirely. Finally, a minor thread emerged when a commenter investigated the author's own business website, leading to a debate about the quality of small business web presences and whether that contributes to their advertising struggles.

## [GOG is getting acquired by its original co-founder](https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/)
**Score:** 626 | **Comments:** 361 | **ID:** 46422412

> **Article:** CD Projekt Red, the parent company of the GOG.com digital game store, is selling GOG back to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński. The stated reason is strategic focus: CD Projekt wants to concentrate its resources on developing RPGs and entertainment based on its own IP (like The Witcher and Cyberpunk). For GOG, the move is framed as a way to gain independence and a long-term backer who shares its core mission of game preservation and DRM-free distribution. GOG's leadership emphasized that the store is financially stable and that this acquisition will allow it to accelerate its unique value proposition.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction is largely positive, viewing the sale as a win for game preservation and ethical business practices. GOG is often seen as a principled "oasis" in the digital storefront landscape, primarily due to its strict no-DRM policy, which allows users to truly own their games. Many commenters express a strong preference for GOG over Steam for this reason, despite acknowledging that GOG's client is less user-friendly and its games can be more expensive.

There is, however, some skepticism about the deal's underlying financial implications. One prominent counter-argument suggests that the optimistic language used in the official announcement (e.g., "encouraging year") is often corporate-speak for a business that is struggling but hoping for a turnaround. This perspective contrasts with the official narrative of GOG being stable and thriving.

The discussion also touches on related topics:
*   **CD Projekt's Strategy:** The move is seen as a logical way for CD Projekt to de-risk its business by offloading a non-core asset and focusing on its highly successful game development studio.
*   **User Experience & Platform Support:** A recurring request from users is for GOG to improve its platform, with a strong call for an official Linux client.
*   **Ownership vs. Licensing:** Commenters reinforce the core philosophical difference between GOG (you own the game files) and platforms like Steam (you are granted a license to use the game).

## [Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain collapses as partner writes down deal by 99%](https://electrek.co/2025/12/29/tesla-4680-battery-supply-chain-collapses-partner-writes-down-dea/)
**Score:** 389 | **Comments:** 426 | **ID:** 46423290

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that L&F, a key partner in Tesla's 4680 battery supply chain, has written down its supply agreement with Tesla by 99%. The value of the deal has been reduced from an initial $2.9 billion to just $7,386. This massive write-down is presented as a strong indicator that the supply chain for Tesla's much-hyped 4680 battery cells has effectively collapsed, casting serious doubt on the future of the technology and its role in producing more affordable Tesla vehicles.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of Tesla's current trajectory and valuation. The central theme is the disconnect between the company's poor operational performance and its high stock price. Many commenters attribute this to the stock being treated as a "call option on Elon Musk" rather than a reflection of the company's fundamentals, with some alleging that the company is using related entities like SpaceX to purchase unsold vehicles like the Cybertruck to artificially inflate sales figures.

Regarding the 4680 battery specifically, commenters expressed little surprise at the news. Some dismissed the technology as a marketing term for a slightly larger battery cell that ultimately failed to deliver on its promises, while others pointed to previous reports of high manufacturing defect rates for the cells. The massive write-down was noted as particularly significant, with one user calculating that the remaining contract value is equivalent to the cost of a single Cybertruck battery pack, suggesting an imminent cancellation of the battery program.

The conversation broadened into a general critique of Tesla's product and market performance. Commenters cited a pattern of unfulfilled promises (like the Robotaxi and Roadster), declining sales across major global markets (Europe, China, US), and a pivot towards futuristic concepts like robots as a distraction from these core business struggles. While some users expressed a desire for a more affordable, simplified EV, the consensus was that Tesla's current strategy is failing and the company's high valuation is unjustified.

## [List of domains censored by German ISPs](https://cuiiliste.de/domains)
**Score:** 358 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46423566

> **Article:** The linked website, cuiiliste.de, provides a list of domains blocked by German Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The list is maintained by CUII (Schutzgemeinschaft Urheberrecht im Internet), a private organization that identifies websites infringing on copyright. German ISPs voluntarily implement DNS-level blocks on these domains, a practice that is not legally mandated but is widely adopted, particularly by larger providers like Telekom.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals that the censorship is primarily focused on copyright infringement, with many users noting the list reads like a "collection of the best pirate sites" rather than a list of malware or other dangerous content. A key point of clarification is that these are DNS blocks, meaning they are easily bypassed by using alternative DNS providers like NextDNS or ControlD, or by using DNS-over-HTTPS. Users also highlight that the blocks are a result of private industry lobbying (CUII) rather than government legislation or court orders, which distinguishes it from more draconian state-level censorship. While some users expressed concern over the presence of sites like Anna's Archive and Sci-Hub on the list, others pointed out that not all ISPs enforce these blocks, and smaller providers or those using alternative infrastructure may not participate. The discussion also touched on broader German attitudes towards copyright enforcement and a related upcoming talk at the Chaos Communication Congress (39c3).

## [Show HN: Vibe coding a bookshelf with Claude Code](https://balajmarius.com/writings/vibe-coding-a-bookshelf-with-claude-code/)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 192 | **ID:** 46420453

> **Project:** The project is a "vibe coded" web application that creates a visual bookshelf. The author used Claude Code, an AI-assisted coding tool, to build the project. The application allows users to manage and display their books in a visually appealing format, likely by scraping data or using an API to populate the shelf. The project is presented as an example of how AI tools can rapidly build personal software for a user of one, turning what would have been a lengthy development process into a quick and accessible task.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's discussion centered on the capabilities and limitations of "vibe coding" (using AI to generate code based on high-level intent). The overall sentiment was positive, with many agreeing this type of project is an ideal use case for current AI tools.

Key themes that emerged were:

*   **Defining Vibe Coding:** Commenters established a distinction between "vibe coding" for small, personal projects and using AI as a powerful assistant in larger, more complex systems. For small apps, the AI handles the execution entirely, which is a huge productivity boost. For larger projects, the developer must still provide architecture, review code, and manage context, using the AI as a skilled junior developer rather than a fully autonomous agent.

*   **The Human Role (Intent & Taste):** A central debate was the enduring importance of human "taste" and intent. While some argued that taste is the last bastion of human value, others countered that it's not a uniquely human trait and that many people will be happy to adopt AI-generated aesthetics. The consensus was that for now, the human's role is to provide the vision and final approval.

*   **Practical Limitations:** Users noted that AI models struggle with large codebases, often adding unnecessary abstractions instead of making minimal, surgical changes. The key to success is managing the AI's context by providing clear instructions, sample code, and architectural guidelines.

*   **Nostalgia and Future Applications:** The project sparked nostalgia for similar applications like the classic Mac app "Delicious Library." Users also saw potential for expansion, suggesting integrations with existing book-tracking services and applying the same "vibe coding" approach to other domains.

## [All Delisted Steam Games](https://delistedgames.com/all-delisted-steam-games/)
**Score:** 236 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46424262

> **Article:** The article is a comprehensive list from delistedgames.com of video games that have been removed from sale on the Steam platform. It categorizes the delistings and provides reasons for their removal where known. The primary causes for delisting are identified as the expiration of licensing agreements (for music, cars, or franchise IP), the closure of the developer or publisher, and the release of remastered or updated versions of the game.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the reasons for game delisting and the implications for game preservation and ownership. The most frequently cited cause is the expiration of licensing deals, particularly for games based on established franchises like Warhammer or featuring real-world brands like cars in the *Blur* racing game. Commenters express frustration that these legal agreements can render excellent games unavailable for new players, even when the games themselves are still perfectly functional.

A key subtopic is the nature of digital ownership. Users confirm that delisted games remain accessible for download and installation in their Steam libraries if previously purchased, which is seen as a crucial consumer protection. This is contrasted with the potential for platforms to completely shut down, though one commenter notes that even defunct systems like the Nintendo 3DS eShop still allow for redownloading past purchases.

The conversation also touches upon related issues, such as platform exclusivity and developer practices. One thread discusses the trade-offs of using the Epic Games Store versus Steam, while another briefly touches on the risks of Kickstarter-funded games being abandoned after an early access launch. Finally, a debate emerges over the quality of Larian Studios' games, questioning whether the *Baldur's Gate 3* IP was a net positive for the game's design compared to their original *Divinity* series.

## [Linux DAW: Help Linux musicians to quickly and easily find the tools they need](https://linuxdaw.org/)
**Score:** 228 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46419968

> **Article:** The article introduces "Linux DAW" (linuxdaw.org), a new website designed to be a centralized directory for Linux-based Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) and audio plugins. The site's primary goal is to help musicians working on the Linux platform discover the tools they need by providing a searchable, filterable database. Users can filter by categories like synthesizers, effects (compression, reverb, etc.), license type (FOSS, commercial), and other features, solving the problem of information being scattered across the internet.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response was largely positive, with users praising the site for solving the discovery problem for Linux audio tools. However, the discussion also branched into several technical and philosophical topics.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the user experience of software interfaces. One commenter criticized the skeuomorphic design of virtual knobs, arguing they are inefficient to control with a mouse. This sparked a debate about whether this design is purely for aesthetics or if it serves a purpose in mimicking physical hardware controllers.

Another key thread compared the technical requirements of real-time audio processing for music versus telephony. While the initial post suggested the two fields are similar, a detailed rebuttal argued they are fundamentally different, with music production having far more stringent requirements for latency, audio resolution, and lack of compression.

Finally, users discussed the state of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) in the audio space. While many celebrated the availability of powerful free tools, there was a noted gap in user interface design quality for FOSS plugins compared to their commercial counterparts, though some counter-examples like Surge and Vital were mentioned. The discussion also clarified that the site is a directory, not an "ad," and touched on the niche of running audio production on hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

## [Swapping SIM cards used to be easy, and then came eSIM](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/i-switched-to-esim-in-2025-and-i-am-full-of-regret/)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 253 | **ID:** 46421653

> **Article:** The article on Ars Technica details the author's frustrating experience with eSIM technology in 2025. Despite the industry's push to eliminate physical SIM cards, the author argues that eSIMs create significant friction in common scenarios. The primary issues highlighted are the difficulty in transferring a number to a new device without the old one being functional, the inability to easily move a SIM to a borrowed or secondary phone, and the reliance on an internet connection to activate a new SIM—precisely when one doesn't have data. The author contrasts this with the simplicity of physical SIMs, which are a universal, offline, and user-controlled method for managing cellular identity. The piece concludes that eSIMs prioritize carrier convenience and control over user freedom and reliability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deeply divided user experience with eSIMs, where outcomes often depend on the specific use case and carrier support. The central conflict is between convenience and control.

Many users shared positive experiences, particularly in the "happy path" of upgrading between new iPhones, where the transfer process is often automated and seamless. eSIMs are also praised as a game-changer for international travel, allowing users to instantly purchase and activate local data plans via an app upon arrival, eliminating the need to find a physical store or wait for a SIM card to be mailed.

However, a larger contingent of users detailed significant frustrations that mirror the article's concerns. These issues frequently arose outside of standard upgrades, such as activating a new device when the old one is broken, moving a SIM to a different phone for testing, or dealing with carriers who are unhelpful or require mailing a QR code. A key point of contention is that eSIM transfers are not a user-controlled process; they require carrier approval, which gives providers the power to block transfers, a practice some believe is designed to lock users into contracts or prevent SIM-swapping fraud. This loss of user autonomy is a major theme, with many commenters expressing a preference for the tangible control of a physical SIM card.

## [Libgodc: Write Go Programs for Sega Dreamcast](https://github.com/drpaneas/libgodc)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46420672

> **Article:** The article introduces "libgodc," a Go runtime for the Sega Dreamcast console. Created by drpaneas, this project allows developers to write programs and games in Go for the 1999 hardware, utilizing features like goroutines, channels, and garbage collection. The runtime is built using gccgo to target the Dreamcast's SH4 CPU and integrates with the KallistiOS homebrew SDK. The repository includes documentation, video tutorials, and example games such as Pong, Breakout, and a Platformer.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with high praise, specifically highlighting the project's documentation as exceptionally thorough and professional, rivaling or exceeding that of major corporations. The discussion touched on several key areas:

Technical implementation details were a primary focus. Users inquired about the use of `gccgo` and its limitations, such as the lack of support for Go Generics. The author confirmed they are using a recent version of `gccgo` which is "ok-ish" but does not yet support all modern Go features. There was also a side discussion about using Go for niche hardware via WebAssembly (WASIP1) and the TinyGo compiler as an alternative approach.

A recurring theme was the juxtaposition of the Dreamcast's "severe constraints" (16MB RAM, 200MHz CPU) against its historical status as a powerhouse. Users expressed amazement that modern software runs on such hardware, with one user humorously contrasting the specs with the resource demands of modern Microsoft Teams.

Finally, the project sparked nostalgia for the Dreamcast era and inspired curiosity about potential future ports, such as porting Diablo or other games to the platform.

## [Nvidia takes $5B stake in Intel under September agreement](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/nvidia-takes-5-billion-stake-intel-under-september-agreement-2025-12-29/)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46423010

> **Article:** Reuters reports that Nvidia has acquired a $5 billion stake in Intel. This investment is part of an agreement made in September, which will make Nvidia one of Intel's largest shareholders, holding approximately 4% of the company following the issuance of new shares.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Nvidia's investment in Intel focuses on skepticism regarding the deal's strategic value and broader concerns about the semiconductor market.

Commenters are largely doubtful that this investment will solve Intel's deep-seated issues. One highly upvoted thread argues that Intel's problems are fundamental and cannot be fixed with money alone, stating that the company lacks the specialized "wizards"—highly skilled engineers, mostly in Taiwan—who are needed to operate advanced fabrication equipment. The idea that Nvidia could simply buy Intel to eliminate competition was dismissed, with users pointing to the significant antitrust hurdles that would block such a merger.

There was also a debate about the actual ownership structure. While one user claimed Nvidia would be a top shareholder alongside the US government and SoftBank, a correction was issued noting that institutional investors like BlackRock and Vanguard hold much larger stakes, placing Nvidia and SoftBank further down the list.

Broader economic themes were also touched upon. Some users viewed the investment as an example of "circular" money flows in an economy with too much capital and few places to invest it. One commenter drew a parallel to Michael Burry's warnings about capital expenditure accounting in the AI boom, suggesting Nvidia's high margins are unsustainable and that a "brutal" market correction is coming.

## [LLMs Are Not Fun](https://orib.dev/nofun.html)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46424136

> **Article:** The article "LLMs Are Not Fun" argues that using Large Language Models for programming is joyless and robs the developer of the core satisfaction of their craft. The author defines the "fun" of programming as the deep, immersive process of understanding a complex system, tracing the ripples of a change through interconnected components, and solving problems through careful thought and typing. They contend that LLMs replace this engaging process with a sterile, managerial task of prompting, reviewing, and correcting generated code. This shift, they argue, turns a creative and intellectually stimulating activity into a tedious chore, akin to debugging someone else's work without the satisfaction of having built it yourself. The author expresses a sense of loss for the craft and the deep engagement that comes from building something from the ground up.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly polarized, with many developers disagreeing with the article's premise while acknowledging the validity of the author's feelings. A central theme is the debate over what constitutes the "fun" or "craft" of programming. Many commenters argue that the joy comes from problem-solving, architecture, and seeing ideas come to life, not from the act of typing or boilerplate implementation. They see LLMs as a tool that automates the tedious parts, freeing them to focus on the more creative and high-level aspects of development, which they find *more* fun.

A key counterpoint is the distinction between prototyping and production. While many celebrate the speed of building side projects and prototypes, others caution that creating robust, high-quality production code still requires significant human effort, control, and understanding, which LLMs can't fully replace.

A significant sub-thread focuses on the social dynamics surrounding AI adoption. Several users praised the author's "bravery" in expressing a dissenting opinion, noting the immense pressure in the tech industry to embrace and praise AI tools. They compare it to the crypto hype, suggesting that not enjoying LLMs is seen as a professional liability.

Finally, some commenters frame the issue as a fundamental difference in how people derive value: from the creative process itself or from the end result. Those who value the outcome are more likely to embrace tools that accelerate production, while those who value the process feel that LLMs are fundamentally at odds with their motivation.

## [Static Allocation with Zig](https://nickmonad.blog/2025/static-allocation-with-zig-kv/)
**Score:** 186 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46422009

> **Article:** The article "Static Allocation with Zig" presents a proof-of-concept in-memory key-value store written in Zig that adheres to a strict memory allocation strategy: all memory is pre-allocated at startup, and no dynamic allocation or deallocation occurs during runtime. This approach, inspired by the "TigerStyle" used by the TigerBeetle database, aims to achieve predictable performance, eliminate runtime allocation overhead, and prevent memory-related bugs like use-after-free. The author demonstrates how Zig's generic allocators and explicit memory management features make this pattern particularly idiomatic and manageable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of appreciation for the engineering discipline and debate over its practicality. A central theme is the contrast between embedded systems programming, where this technique is standard practice, and general-purpose application development, where it is less common. Commenters from embedded backgrounds dismiss the "TigerStyle" branding as a re-packaging of known techniques, while others argue that applying these methods to a database is a noteworthy and deliberate choice that forces developers to think critically about resource limits.

The primary motivations for this approach, as cited by proponents (including a TigerBeetle developer), are operational predictability (consistent latency), code simplification by avoiding complex pointer lifetimes, and forcing the design to have explicit, application-level limits. This is contrasted with the author's in-memory key-value store, where pre-allocation imposes a hard cap on the number of items, a trade-off that may not be suitable for all applications. TigerBeetle itself is noted to be file-system-backed, so its static allocation limits only in-memory working set size, not total storage.

Practical concerns were also raised, such as the risk of memory overcommit on Linux, which can undermine the predictability goal, and the fact that developers must still manage the "in-use" state of pre-allocated memory to avoid application-level use-after-free bugs. Overall, the discussion acknowledges the benefits for performance-critical systems but questions its universal applicability.

## [Feynman's Hughes Lectures: 950 pages of notes](https://thehugheslectures.info/the-lectures/)
**Score:** 180 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46419273

> **Article:** The article links to a website hosting Richard Feynman's complete set of notes (approx. 950 pages) for his 1952 Hughes Lectures. These notes are notable for being meticulously written in all capital letters and include detailed diagrams and equations. The site clarifies that these lectures are distinct from the famous "Feynman Lectures on Physics" given at Caltech.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is largely positive, with users expressing admiration for the sheer productivity and artistry of Feynman's handwritten notes. Several commenters appreciate the historical value of the documents, viewing them as "pieces of renaissance art." 

However, a notable sub-thread questions the "cult of personality" surrounding Feynman. One user argued that other seminal textbooks, such as Purcell's *Electricity and Magnetism*, are under-appreciated by comparison. Others countered that Feynman's fame and charisma naturally gave his lectures a broader reach than standard textbooks. Additionally, users clarified that these specific notes are from a different lecture series than the famous Caltech set, and one commenter recommended Malcolm Longair's books as a more accessible alternative to Feynman's lectures.

## [UK accounting body to halt remote exams amid AI cheating](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/29/uk-accounting-remote-exams-ai-cheating-acca)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46420289

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports that the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), a major UK accounting body, will stop offering remote exams. The decision is a direct response to the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, which make cheating on unsupervised tests trivially easy. The ACCA is reverting to in-person invigilated exams to ensure the integrity and credibility of its professional qualifications. The move highlights a broader crisis of trust in remote assessment methods that were rapidly adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the ACCA's decision, with a strong consensus that remote, unsupervised exams are no longer viable in the age of AI. However, the conversation quickly pivots to broader criticisms of professional bodies and the education system.

A dominant theme is cynicism towards the ACCA and similar gatekeeping institutions. Several users argue this move is less about educational integrity and more about preserving the organization's "relevancy" and revenue streams. They contend that the ACCA was already an overly powerful gatekeeper and that its pivot is a self-preservation tactic rather than a principled stand. This criticism extends to universities, with some viewing them as outdated institutions trying to maintain their financial model.

The mechanics and normalization of cheating are explored in depth. Users note that AI has fundamentally changed the game by removing the need for students to even understand a problem to find the correct answer. Anecdotes from teachers describe a stark performance gap between students' high remote grades and their poor in-person results. There's a shared concern that AI has normalized cheating, creating a "if you don't cheat, you're at a disadvantage" environment.

While the return to in-person testing is seen as necessary, its implementation is debated. Some users point out that even in-person exams are not foolproof, citing a sophisticated Swedish cheating ring that used hidden electronics. Others question the format, arguing that pen-and-paper tests may be outdated and that school-administered computers with monitoring software or even oral exams might be more effective. A professor in the comments confirms they are shifting back to in-person, on-paper exams to combat cheating, seeing it as a way to re-establish the value of physical institutions.

Finally, some commenters frame the issue as a symptom of a larger disconnect between education and the job market, suggesting that regardless of assessment methods, colleges and professional bodies are failing to teach relevant, practical skills.

## [The future of software development is software developers](https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/11/25/the-future-of-software-development-is-software-developers/)
**Score:** 160 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46424233

> **Article:** The article argues that the core challenge of software development is not writing code, but the cognitive process of translating ambiguous human needs into precise, computational thinking. The author posits that this fundamental difficulty remains constant regardless of the technology used, from punch cards to modern AI. While acknowledging the hype around AI, the author expresses skepticism about its long-term economic viability, suggesting that the massive costs and losses incurred by AI companies will eventually limit the technology's progress and accessibility, preventing it from becoming a truly transformative force in the way previous technologies have.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and nuanced debate on the true impact of AI on software development, with commenters falling into several distinct camps.

A significant portion of the conversation centers on the nature of programming itself. Many agree with the article's central thesis that the "hard part" is the intellectual work of defining and structuring problems, not the act of writing syntax. However, others argue that this overlooks the many tedious and expensive aspects of development that AI is already making more efficient, such as boilerplate code generation and language translation.

The emotional and professional anxiety of developers is a prominent theme. One commenter expresses a profound fear of becoming obsolete, feeling like a "conductor" for a team of AIs that perform tasks previously requiring a large engineering org. This fear is countered by a philosophical argument that LLMs are merely sophisticated pattern-matchers, not true reasoners, and that human understanding and adaptability to novel situations remain irreplaceable. The analogy of the Luddites and the industrial revolution was used to frame the current disruption, with debate over whether it will lead to total replacement or simply a transformation of the industry.

There is also a strong technical debate on the future trajectory of AI models. Some argue that the reliance on human-generated data will create a "slop feedback loop," where AI-generated code dilutes the quality of future training data, creating a hard ceiling on improvement. Others counter that future progress will rely less on scraped data and more on reinforcement learning and synthetic data, making this a non-issue.

Finally, a recurring perspective is that AI is best viewed as another layer in the development process, akin to the "Swiss cheese" model of safety in aviation. It's an imperfect tool that, when properly integrated and managed, can improve overall outcomes. The consensus seems to be that while AI won't eliminate the need for developers, it is fundamentally changing the role, much like past productivity tools (e.g., Visual Basic) that empowered non-experts but still required skilled programmers for robust, reliable systems.

## [AI is forcing us to write good code](https://bits.logic.inc/p/ai-is-forcing-us-to-write-good-code)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 113 | **ID:** 46424200

> **Article:** The article "AI is forcing us to write good code" argues that the rise of AI coding assistants necessitates a shift towards stricter software engineering practices. The author posits that while AI can generate code rapidly, it is not inherently safe or reliable. To harness its power effectively, teams must create a "safe sandbox" for AI to operate within.

This is achieved by enforcing high standards that make the codebase predictable and machine-readable. Key recommendations include:
*   **100% Test Coverage:** Not just for correctness, but to provide a deterministic, automated way for AI to verify its own changes and for developers to validate them.
*   **Strict Static Typing:** To provide unambiguous context and constraints for the AI.
*   **Automated Formatting and Linting:** To eliminate stylistic noise and keep the code consistent.
*   **Functional Purity:** Avoiding side effects and global state to make code behavior easier to reason about and test.

The author's thesis is that these practices, which reduce ambiguity and increase verifiability, are no longer just "nice-to-haves" but are essential prerequisites for a productive human-AI coding partnership.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, with commenters largely agreeing with the core principles of code quality but debating the article's framing and the role of AI.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **AI as a Catalyst for Best Practices:** Many agreed that AI is a powerful forcing function for adopting long-established best practices like 100% test coverage and strict typing. One commenter noted that while these things were always valuable, AI makes them "200%" important because they create a reliable feedback loop and a "reified context" for future AI interactions. Another highlighted that these practices maximize what LLMs are good at (cranking out code) while giving them easy, verifiable targets.

*   **Skepticism and Marketing:** A significant portion of the discussion was skeptical of the article's premise and author. Some viewed it as self-promotion for the author's startup, suggesting the title should be "How we're forcing AI to write good code (because it's normally not that good)." Others expressed concern that inexperienced programmers might misinterpret the article as a complete guide, overlooking the foundational engineering discipline required.

*   **The Nature of AI and Code Quality:** Commenters debated whether LLMs can truly innovate or just regurgitate existing patterns. The consensus was that humans will still drive innovation, but LLMs are nimble enough to apply new concepts from a few examples. A key point was that code is uniquely suited for AI automation because it has defined rules and feedback loops (compilers, tests), unlike more creative or physical fields.

*   **Pragmatic Concerns and Counterpoints:** Some users raised practical issues. One pointed out that a TypeScript test suite running in under a second for "hundreds of thousands of lines" of code is highly improbable. Another questioned the security risks of using LLMs for "good code" and their ability to stay current with new technologies. A recurring sentiment was that the practices advocated for (good DX, testing, tooling) are simply good engineering and should be pursued regardless of AI, with AI being a new reason to do so, not the sole cause.

## [EU to build no-fee payments service like Visa/Mastercard and Apple/Google Pay](https://www.independent.ie/business/digital-euro-what-it-is-and-how-we-will-use-the-new-form-of-cash/a165973061.html)
**Score:** 147 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46419121

> **Article:** The Independent Ireland article reports on the European Union's plan to develop a "digital euro," a public payment infrastructure designed to function as a no-fee alternative to private card networks like Visa and Mastercard, and mobile wallets from Apple and Google. The project is framed as a strategic move to reduce Europe's dependency on US-based financial technology giants and ensure "technological sovereignty." The system aims to be universally accepted across the Eurozone, built by European companies, and would likely be accessible via a dedicated app or as a feature integrated into existing banking apps. The ultimate goal is to provide a secure, publicly-owned digital payment rail for everyday transactions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a complex and divided sentiment towards the proposed digital euro. The conversation is anchored by several key themes:

A significant portion of the debate centers on **privacy and state control**. While some, like `mentalgear`, champion the initiative as a way to reclaim financial data from "surveillance capitalism," others express deep concern. `Yizahi` provides the most extreme critique, warning that a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) could enable unprecedented government control, such as programmable money with spending restrictions, expiry dates, or the ability to freeze accounts of political dissidents. This highlights a fundamental tension between trusting democratic institutions versus fearing their potential for overreach.

The discussion also explores the **political and strategic motivations** behind the project. Many see it as a necessary step for European sovereignty, reducing reliance on US payment infrastructure (`Havoc`, `jryio`). However, `mytailorisrich` offers a cynical counter-narrative, arguing the real aim is not to free member states but to consolidate power at the EU level, further eroding national sovereignty. This view is challenged by others who point out that national sovereignty in payments is already limited, as most countries lack their own systems.

Finally, there is considerable **skepticism regarding implementation and effectiveness**. Some commenters question the project's "European-only" tech mandate while acknowledging the reliance on American mobile operating systems (`spwa4`, `vrighter`). Others, like `mathverse`, express frustration with the EU's slow pace, comparing it unfavorably to established systems in India or Sweden. `jampekje` criticizes the official narrative, pointing out the hypocrisy of the EU promoting a no-fee system while its own regulations prevent merchants from passing on credit card fees to consumers. The consensus is that while the idea is sound, execution will be fraught with political, technical, and regulatory challenges.

## [When someone says they hate your product](https://www.getflack.com/p/responding-to-negative-feedback)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46424460

> **Article:** The article "When someone says they hate your product" advises founders and product teams on how to handle extreme negative feedback. The core message is to not take it personally but to treat it as valuable data. The author suggests that "haters" are often passionate users who care enough to complain, and their feedback, if filtered correctly, can highlight critical flaws. The recommended strategy involves separating the actionable "signal" (the specific problem) from the emotional "noise" (the anger or theatrics). By acknowledging the issue, asking clarifying questions, and focusing on the underlying problem, a company can de-escalate conflict, potentially turn a detractor into an advocate, and improve the product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validated the article's advice but added significant nuance and skepticism. A central theme was the difficulty of separating constructive criticism from bad-faith attacks. While many agreed that hostile feedback can contain valuable "signal," others warned that some users are simply toxic and should be "fired" by offering a refund and severing the relationship.

The conversation also explored the psychology of feedback. One user noted that frustration can be a powerful "fuel for innovation," while another argued that the most hated products are often those that failed to meet high expectations. There was a strong consensus that the initial response from a company is critical; acknowledging the complaint and showing a willingness to improve can de-escalate the situation and even turn detractors into valuable contributors.

However, the discussion was punctuated by skepticism and sarcasm. Some users pointed out that the article's advice might not apply to companies with monopolistic power, who have little incentive to listen. Others humorously debated the meaning of "understanding" in AI, and one user ironically demonstrated the exact opposite of the article's advice with a hostile comment, which was immediately called out. Ultimately, the community agreed that while the article's approach is mature and effective, it requires emotional discipline and is not always the right tool for every situation.
