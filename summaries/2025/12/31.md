## [Netflix Open Content](https://opencontent.netflix.com/)
**Score:** 623 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46431560

> **Article:** The article links to the Netflix Open Content page, a repository of test content for media engineers. This content includes video clips, audio files, and production assets that Netflix has used internally to test its media pipelines and encoding technologies. The goal is to provide standardized, high-quality materials for the open-source community and industry partners to develop and test video codecs, players, and other media tools, ultimately helping to improve the video streaming ecosystem that Netflix relies on.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of appreciation for the resource and sharp criticism of the page's presentation and the state of streaming innovation. The most prominent theme is the page's unprofessional appearance. Commenters point out that it lacks an SSL certificate, uses insecure HTTP download links, and appears to be a "zero effort" design, possibly a forgotten "pet project" last updated in 2020. The odd routing of all links through Google's `url` service was also noted, with one user explaining it's likely a default behavior of their Blogger hosting platform.

Beyond the page's quality, users debated the purpose of the project. The consensus is that Netflix benefits by fostering better open-source tools and codecs, which in turn lowers their own bandwidth costs. A broader discussion emerged lamenting the lack of innovation in online video compared to physical media, with users noting the absence of features like director's commentaries and behind-the-scenes content that were common on DVDs.

Finally, users pointed to more recent and formalized industry efforts, such as the Academy Software Foundation's Digital Production Example Library (DPEL), suggesting that while Netflix's page is a useful resource, it may be a relic of a less organized approach to open content in the industry.

## [Go away Python](https://lorentz.app/blog-item.html?id=go-shebang)
**Score:** 376 | **Comments:** 341 | **ID:** 46431028

> **Article:** The article proposes a method for writing Go programs that can be executed as shell scripts using a shebang line (`//usr/bin/go run "$0" "$@"; exit`). The author acknowledges this is an unusual approach, contrasting Go's compiled, "shippable" nature with the "scriptable" feel of languages like Bash. While initially presented as a troll, the author concedes it's not a terrible idea for simple, dependency-free scripts, as it bypasses the need for a formal Go module setup. The post concludes that while Go is fantastic, it lacks the ergonomic for quick, throwaway scripting that Bash or Python provide, and the Go community's official stance is against interpreter mode.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly polarized, with many commenters expressing strong disapproval of using Go for scripting, citing its rigid tooling and lack of ergonomics compared to Python, Ruby, or Bash. A key point of contention is dependency management; while the author sees the proposed shebang method as a way to avoid `go.mod`, others point out that it fails to solve the problem of fetching third-party libraries. Several users counter the article's premise by highlighting modern Python tools like `uv`, which offer robust, standardized support for running scripts with dependencies via shebangs, effectively solving the exact problem the author faces with Go. There is also a recurring debate on language ergonomics, with many agreeing that Go's culture encourages building robust, testable applications, which is at odds with the quick-and-dirty nature of scripting. Technical corrections are offered regarding shebang portability and exit code propagation.

## [Nicolas Guillou, French ICC judge sanctioned by the US and “debanked”](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/19/nicolas-guillou-french-icc-judge-sanctioned-by-the-us-you-are-effectively-blacklisted-by-much-of-the-world-s-banking-system_6747628_4.html)
**Score:** 370 | **Comments:** 387 | **ID:** 46432057

> **Article:** The article from Le Monde details how Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), has been sanctioned by the United States. This sanction, likely under the Magnitsky Act, effectively "debanks" him, cutting him off from much of the global financial system. The sanctions are a response to the ICC's investigations into alleged war crimes committed by Israeli officials in the Palestinian territories. Guillou is one of the judges who approved arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The piece highlights the severe personal and professional consequences for a European judge operating within a US-dominated financial infrastructure, framing it as a major escalation in the conflict between the US/Israel and the ICC.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the US sanctions, viewing them as an abuse of power that undermines the rule of law and international institutions. A central theme is the hypocrisy of using a human rights sanctions framework against judges who are prosecuting human rights violations. Many commenters argue that this action exposes the "rules-based order" as a tool of geopolitical convenience rather than a consistent principle, which could accelerate the de-dollarization of the global financial system as other nations seek alternatives to US-controlled banking.

The conversation splits into several distinct threads. One thread debates the viability of alternatives like Bitcoin, with some seeing it as a necessary escape from financial censorship, while others dismiss it as unsustainable and primarily for criminals. Another thread connects this event to a broader pattern of US sanctions being used to interfere in the judicial processes of allied nations, with a specific example of a Brazilian judge being sanctioned.

While most commenters condemn the US action, a few offer counterarguments. Some contend that the US, as a non-signatory, does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction and is acting to protect its interests and those of its ally, Israel. However, this view is challenged by others who point to the sanctions on a Brazilian judge as evidence that the motivation is not solely about ICC jurisdiction but about punishing any legal action that runs counter to current US administration interests. The overall sentiment is that this move is a significant blow to American soft power and the perceived impartiality of international law.

## [Non-Zero-Sum Games](https://nonzerosum.games/)
**Score:** 356 | **Comments:** 178 | **ID:** 46432311

> **Article:** The linked website, "Non-Zero-Sum Games," is a blog that uses concepts from game theory to analyze social dynamics, morality, and systems. The articles argue that many human interactions are not zero-sum (where one's gain is another's loss) but are often non-zero-sum, where cooperation can create mutual benefit. The site explores concepts like "effortocracy" (distinguishing effort from achievement in moral terms) and uses game theory to discuss why cooperation is often a superior long-term strategy, despite the short-term appeal of defection. The site is noted for its distinctive, whimsical visual design with custom fonts and animations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is split between commentary on the website's aesthetics and a deep debate on the game theory concepts presented.

**Aesthetics and Design**
There is a sharp divide on the site's visual presentation. Many users praised its unique, "pretty," and stand-out design, contrasting it with generic "AI slop." However, a significant number of others found the design actively detrimental to readability, criticizing the choice of fonts (some compared them to Comic Sans), small text size, distracting animations, and poor color contrast.

**Game Theory and Morality**
The core philosophical debate centered on whether cooperation or defection is the "winning strategy" in society.
*   **The Case for Defection:** One commenter argued that in the real world, cheating is an objectively superior strategy. They claimed that reputation is easily shed, people are forgiving of abusers, and morality is an irrational "net loss" to the individual, putting honest people at a disadvantage.
*   **The Case for Cooperation:** This view was strongly countered by several users. They argued that modern prosperity is built on a massive foundation of collaboration and trust. They pointed out that cooperation is a stable, evolved strategy seen across many species and that systems of reputation and institutions are designed to make cooperation the rational choice. A key insight was that while individual cheating can be effective, it is a parasitic behavior that can only be tolerated up to a point before the collaborative system collapses.
*   **Nuance:** A middle ground was also proposed, suggesting that the *appearance* of cooperation is critical. It is better for individuals to be "unjust while seeming just" to maintain the social fabric, as overtly selfish behavior can cause a cascade of distrust and systemic failure.

**Specific Article Critiques**
*   **Affirmative Action:** A user critiqued an article's take on affirmative action, arguing it creates a zero-sum game by redistributing fixed resources (e.g., university spots). The counter-argument was that the "meritocracy" it seeks to correct is already a zero-sum system, skewed by historical and generational advantages like legacy admissions.
*   **Effortocracy:** The concept of rewarding effort was debated. One user questioned why society should reward "pointless, Sisyphean tasks," while another clarified the distinction between rewarding merit (which enables positive-sum collaboration) and assigning moral weight to effort itself.

**Technical Issues**
Multiple users reported that the site's RSS feed was broken, preventing them from subscribing.

## [A faster heart for F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/2025/12/30/a-faster-heart-for-f-droid.html)
**Score:** 336 | **Comments:** 144 | **ID:** 46436409

> **Article:** The article "A Faster Heart for F-Droid" announces a major hardware upgrade for the F-Droid build servers. The previous server was 12-year-old hardware that had been running for five years, which was causing significant speed and maintenance issues. The new server is described as a substantial performance improvement, intended to accelerate the app build process and reduce the maintenance burden on the volunteer team. The post also emphasizes the unique hosting arrangement: the server is not in a commercial data center but is physically held by a trusted, long-time contributor, allowing the team full control and knowledge of its physical location and access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely critical and focused on two main themes: the amateurish nature of the infrastructure and the project's transparency.

A dominant point of criticism was the hosting arrangement. Commenters expressed alarm that a project as central to the open-source Android ecosystem as F-Droid relies on a server physically located in a contributor's home. They described this setup as "janky," "unprofessional," and a significant single point of failure, especially given that F-Droid recently received a $400,000 grant, which many felt should be used for professional colocation. The lack of detail about the new hardware was also noted as conspicuous.

However, there was a counter-narrative defending the project. Some commenters argued that such grassroots, volunteer-run infrastructure is the backbone of the open-source world and should be appreciated, not criticized. They pointed out that the server is for building apps, not just hosting files, and that simple setups can be surprisingly effective. Others felt the criticism was misplaced, representing a corporate mindset that fails to value volunteer efforts.

Finally, a smaller thread questioned the project's transparency, asking why the team couldn't be more open about their hardware specifications and hosting details, which would better inform their user base about the project's operational realities.

## [OpenAI's cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/12/30/openais-cash-burn-will-be-one-of-the-big-bubble-questions-of-2026)
**Score:** 282 | **Comments:** 378 | **ID:** 46438390

> **Article:** The Economist article posits that OpenAI's immense cash burn will be a defining "bubble question" of 2026. It frames the company's strategy as a high-stakes gamble on the rapid monetization of AI, with massive expenditures on compute and talent far outstripping revenue. The central question is whether this spending can be justified by future profits or if it represents a speculative bubble destined to pop, with the answer becoming clear within the next year.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's premise and OpenAI's financial strategy. A common theme is that the term "cash burn" is misleading; commenters argue the money isn't disappearing but is being transferred to entities like Nvidia and highly-paid engineers. The core of the debate centers on OpenAI's lack of a clear path to profitability. Many believe the company's valuation is disconnected from reality, with one user comparing OpenAI's ~$500B valuation to the entire global chocolate market (~$135B) to highlight the absurdity.

There is significant disagreement about OpenAI's actual progress. One commenter claims they haven't trained a new foundational model since GPT-4o, suggesting their expenses aren't tied to runaway training costs. This is countered by others who point to GPT-4.5 and massive operational costs for data centers and salaries. The discussion also explores alternative business models, with one user suggesting Anthropic's focus on coding offers a clearer SaaS path to profitability, while OpenAI might be forced to turn to advertising.

Finally, the conversation touches on broader geopolitical and societal factors. Some see the investment as a strategic play in a US-China "cold war style arms race," making a government bailout or continued support more likely. Others worry that the industry has over-promised on capabilities, and any slowdown will be perceived as failure, creating a classic bubble dynamic.

## [FediMeteo: A €4 FreeBSD VPS Became a Global Weather Service](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/02/26/fedimeteo-how-a-tiny-freebsd-vps-became-a-global-weather-service-for-thousands/)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46436889

> **Article:** The article "FediMeteo: A €4 FreeBSD VPS Became a Global Weather Service" details the creation and scaling of a weather service for the Fediverse (the "fediverse" being a collection of social networking services like Mastodon). The author, draga79, explains how they built the service, named FediMeteo, on an extremely low-cost Virtual Private Server (VPS) from Netcup costing just €4 per month. Despite the minimal cost, the server boasts impressive specs: 4 shared CPU cores, 4GB of RAM, 120GB of SSD storage, and a 1Gbit/sec internet connection.

The service works by fetching weather data from the Open-Meteo API and posting localized, emoji-based weather forecasts to Fediverse instances. It started small but quickly grew to serve thousands of users across the globe. The author details the technical architecture, including the use of FreeBSD for its efficiency and stability, and the use of a simple, stateless design that allows it to handle high traffic without significant resource strain. The post serves as an inspiration, demonstrating that powerful, scalable services can be built on a shoestring budget with the right technical choices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded very positively to the article, with commenters expressing admiration for the project's ingenuity and the author's execution. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

A significant portion of the conversation revolved around the **remarkable price-to-performance ratio of the €4 VPS**. Several users were skeptical that such a deal existed, comparing it unfavorably to popular providers like Hetzner. The author clarified that the VPS is from Netcup, and another user pointed to Lowendbox.com as a resource for finding similar deals, sparking a sub-thread about the best places to find cheap hosting.

Many commenters were inspired by the project's **technical elegance and efficiency**. The choice of FreeBSD was highlighted by one user who shared their own positive experience with its low resource usage and performance on a cheap VM. This led to a broader discussion about lightweight operating systems and tools, with another user mentioning Alpine Linux as a similarly snappy and minimal alternative. The project was praised as a perfect example of how one can achieve a lot with very little, eschewing modern bloat for a simple, effective stack.

Finally, the discussion touched on **personal projects and the "joy of tinkering."** Several users shared their own ideas for small-scale applications, such as a retro BBS-style blog or a weather service, and expressed how the article encouraged them to pursue these hobbies. The author was consistently present and responsive in the comments, answering technical questions and engaging with the community's feedback.

## [A Vulnerability in Libsodium](https://00f.net/2025/12/30/libsodium-vulnerability/)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46435614

> **Article:** The article announces a vulnerability in the widely-used cryptography library Libsodium. The flaw relates to how the library handles points on the Curve25519 elliptic curve. Specifically, the implementation of the `crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point` function failed to correctly validate that a point lies within the prime-order subgroup of the curve. While the library correctly checked if a point was on the curve, it missed the crucial step of ensuring the point wasn't a "low-order" point. This could potentially undermine the security of higher-level cryptographic protocols built on top of the library that rely on the mathematical properties of a prime-order group. The article serves as a security advisory for developers using Libsodium.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly evolved from a simple acknowledgment of the issue into a deep, technical exploration of elliptic curve cryptography and the broader open-source security ecosystem.

A key theme was the proactive response from the security community. A user known as CiPHPerCoder immediately noted that the vulnerability also affected the PHP library `sodium_compat` and took on the significant task of auditing other Ed25519 implementations across the open-source landscape to check for similar flaws. This highlights the "blast radius" of a bug in a foundational library like Libsodium.

The conversation also delved into the technical nuances of the problem. A user named loup-vaillant provided a detailed counterpoint, explaining that the original design of X25519 and Ed25519 was intended to make such checks unnecessary. They argued that for many use cases, protocols can be designed to be inherently safe from low-order component attacks, and that Ristretto255 (mentioned in the article) is a solution for situations where this isn't possible. This sparked a deeper discussion on the trade-offs between protocol design, API simplicity, and cryptographic purity.

Finally, there was a strong undercurrent of appreciation for the library's author, Frank Denis, with users thanking him for his work and suggesting that companies should sponsor his efforts. This reflects the often-unsung but critical role that individual maintainers play in securing the global software infrastructure.

## [Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts](https://hsu.cy/2025/12/times-new-american/)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46432862

> **Article:** The article "Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts" examines the recent decision by the U.S. State Department to revert its official documents from Calibri (15pt) back to Times New Roman (14pt). The author analyzes the aesthetic and practical differences between the two fonts. They conclude that while Calibri can look informal, like "something from a leasing office," Times New Roman is "banal" and historically associated with cost-cutting newspaper printing rather than prestige. The article suggests that the change is less about design and more about political signaling, specifically rejecting the previous administration's association with Calibri, which was recently labeled "wasteful" and "DEI" (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) by political figures like Marco Rubio.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely mirrors the article's skepticism, treating the font change as a political gesture rather than a design improvement. The debate centers on three main themes:

**1. The Political Motivation**
Many commenters view the decision as a culture war skirmish. Several users sarcastically suggest that the administration should use "Comic Sans" or "Fraktur," while others explicitly state that the change is driven by the current administration's desire to remove anything associated with "DEI." One user noted that the rationale seems to be that Calibri was a "DEI font" and that open-source or accessibility-focused fonts might be dismissed due to political associations (e.g., "communism").

**2. Typography and Legibility**
There is a robust technical debate regarding font readability:
*   **Serif vs. Sans-Serif:** Users debated whether serif fonts (Times) are truly better for reading. One user provided a detailed history, explaining that serifs help guide the eye along lines of text, though line length is equally important. Others countered that sans-serif fonts (like Calibri) are generally better for screens, while serifs are better for print.
*   **Design Quality:** The creator of Calibri, Luc(as) de Groot, commented to defend his font. He argued that Times New Roman is an outdated digital typeface with poor spacing and limited weights, whereas Calibri was designed specifically for legibility on modern screens.
*   **Accessibility:** Users noted that Calibri is often recommended for people with dyslexia due to its distinct letter shapes, while others argued that the government should use free/libre fonts like "Public Sans" (which the government already developed) to ensure accessibility and distinguishability between characters like 'l' and 'I'.

**3. Bureaucratic Incompetence**
A prevailing sentiment is that the debate highlights general government incompetence. Users mocked the idea that such a minor stylistic choice warrants high-level attention, contrasting it with more pressing issues ("Healthcare pls"). The consensus is that reverting to a default font like Times New Roman signals a lack of thought or branding, with one user summarizing the situation as "rolling back" a mistake, but choosing the "wrong" default.

## [HSBC blocks its app due to F-Droid-installed Bitwarden](https://mastodon.neilzone.co.uk/@neil/115807834298031971)
**Score:** 235 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46431453

> **Article:** The article, shared via a Mastodon post, describes a user whose HSBC banking app blocked them from using it. The block was triggered because the user had Bitwarden (a password manager) installed via F-Droid, an alternative Android app store. The core issue is that banking apps use Google's SafetyNet or similar integrity checks to scan the device for apps with "overlay" permissions (which can draw on top of other apps), viewing them as potential malware that could trick users into entering credentials on fake screens. This practice is part of a broader trend of banking apps employing aggressive, restrictive security measures that often target power users, such as those using custom ROMs, root access, or alternative app stores.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the conflict between aggressive banking app security and user autonomy. The community debated whether these restrictions are a legitimate defense against malware or an overreach of control. Key points of the conversation included:

*   **Justification vs. User Control:** Some commenters argued that from a risk management perspective, HSBC's actions are reasonable to prevent fraud. However, the prevailing sentiment was that these measures are "security theater" and an invasion of user property. A recurring theme was the need for users to have the final say and be able to override such faulty checks, even if it means accepting the risk.

*   **Technical Workarounds and Limitations:** Users discussed the technical reasons for the block, confirming that it's often due to an app having overlay permissions. They also explored potential solutions, such as using Android's "Work Profile" to isolate banking apps or using a dedicated, separate device for banking. However, it was noted that even these methods can be blocked if the device has developer mode enabled.

*   **The Rise of "De-banking":** The conversation broadened to a larger concern about "de-banking," where financial institutions cut off users not just for security flags but also due to political pressure or sanctions. This was framed as a dangerous trend where companies can control access to essential services based on their own opaque policies.

*   **Alternatives and a Call for Change:** Many users suggested switching to banks with more lenient policies (like Monzo, which gives a warning but allows access) or abandoning banking apps altogether in favor of robust web-based banking. The discussion concluded with a call for better technical solutions from banks, such as using Android's Protected Confirmation for secure transactions, rather than resorting to overly restrictive and user-hostile app designs.

## [Public Sans – A strong, neutral typeface](https://public-sans.digital.gov/)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46433579

> **Article:** The article links to the official page for "Public Sans," a free, open-source typeface developed by the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) and 18F. It is described as a "strong, neutral" sans-serif font designed for user interfaces and body text. The font is a derivative of the proprietary Franklin Gothic typeface, modified to be a standalone, open-source font suitable for government websites and digital services. The page provides details on its characteristics, usage, and availability, including its GitHub repository.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive regarding the font's aesthetic quality but delves into several specific design and contextual topics. A major thread focuses on the critical importance of character legibility, particularly the differentiation between similar glyphs like the uppercase 'I', lowercase 'l', and number '1'. This sparked a debate where several users championed IBM Plex Sans and Atkinson Hyperlegible as superior alternatives specifically because of their excellent character distinction.

Other key points of discussion include:
*   **Context and History:** Users clarified the font's origins as a pre-existing government project, predating recent controversies over government font choices.
*   **Design Comparisons:** Commenters compared Public Sans to other popular fonts like Roboto, Aptos, and Libre Franklin, with some finding it too similar to existing options to be distinct, while others appreciated its specific characteristics.
*   **Utility and Viability:** Despite some aesthetic critiques, the font was generally praised as a pleasant and useful addition to the open-source font landscape. Some users expressed skepticism about the long-term support for the project given changes in the government agencies that created it, but were reassured by its open-source license and GitHub availability.

## [NYC Mayoral Inauguration bans Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero alongside explosives](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/12/30/nyc-mayoral-inauguration-bans-raspberry-pi-and-flipper-zero-alongside-explosives/)
**Score:** 209 | **Comments:** 171 | **ID:** 46438828

> **Article:** An article on the Adafruit blog reports that the NYC Mayoral Inauguration security protocols have banned Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero devices, placing them in the same prohibited category as explosives. The article highlights the perceived absurdity of equating common electronics development boards and hobbyist tools with dangerous weapons, framing it as an example of security theater and a lack of technical understanding by event organizers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily mocks the ban as an example of ineffective and uninformed security theater. The central theme is the futility of banning specific brand names like "Raspberry Pi," with users pointing out that enforcement would be arbitrary and that the intent is likely to prohibit any small circuit board computer, regardless of the label. Commenters find the comparison to explosives ridiculous and speculate that the ban is likely the work of a new security official trying to appear proactive.

Several related points were raised: users questioned why other common electronics like cell phones or laptops aren't similarly banned, with one user suggesting that labeling items as "not weapons" allows authorities to bypass certain legal challenges. The discussion also touched on the Streisand effect, with many noting the ban would likely increase awareness and desire for the Flipper Zero device. Personal anecdotes from users about traveling with electronics like Pis and modems highlighted inconsistent enforcement by authorities like the TSA. Finally, a minor but notable side-thread criticized the Adafruit blog itself for using Cloudflare, which blocks Tor users and presents intrusive CAPTCHAs, as being "hacker-unfriendly."

## [Everything as code: How we manage our company in one monorepo](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/everything-as-code-monorepo)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 178 | **ID:** 46437381

> **Article:** The article "Everything as code: How we manage our company in one monorepo" details the author's approach to managing their entire company (Kasava) from a single Git repository. This includes not just application code for the front-end and back-end, but also marketing content, business plans, and design documents. The primary motivation is to provide full context to AI coding assistants like Anthropic's Claude, enabling it to make holistic changes across different domains. The author argues this setup eliminates synchronization issues, simplifies the mental model, and accelerates development by keeping everything interconnected and atomic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide on the monorepo concept, with a significant portion of the debate centering on the new context of AI-assisted development.

A prominent theme is the newfound appeal of monorepos for AI workflows. Several commenters, including the top-rated one, explain that they were previously against monorepos but changed their minds because tools like Claude Code work much more effectively when they can access the entire company's context in one place. This allows for atomic changes across the full stack (e.g., front-end and back-end simultaneously) and simplifies the AI's task.

However, experienced developers raise significant concerns about scalability and operational maturity. Critics argue that the "one change, everywhere" model is a fallacy for production systems with networked APIs and databases. They point out that you cannot deploy code and a database schema change simultaneously without risk, and that lock-step deployments create organizational bottlenecks where one team can hold back an entire company. The consensus among these critics is that while a monorepo may be fine for a small startup, it will inevitably lead to "scale hell" and cross-contamination without strict discipline and robust CI/CD pipelines that decouple deployment from the repository structure.

Finally, there is a practical debate about tooling. Commenters question the author's "no workspaces" approach, warning that manual dependency management will lead to version drift and "it works on my machine" issues. Alternatives like git submodules are mentioned but are widely considered to have their own "gotchas." The discussion also touches on the broader philosophical split between monorepos and multi-repos, with multi-repo proponents favoring composability and independent versioning, while monorepo advocates highlight the ease of making cross-cutting changes.

## [Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming](https://codecrafters.io/blog/programming-project-ideas)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46439027

> **Article:** The article from CodeCrafters.io, titled "Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming," presents a list of 100 programming projects designed to help developers deepen their understanding and appreciation of software engineering. The projects range from creating a text editor, building a database, or implementing a ray tracer to writing your own memory allocator, shell, or BitTorrent client. The underlying theme is the "build from scratch" philosophy, suggesting that by recreating complex systems, programmers can gain a more profound insight into how they work, moving beyond surface-level knowledge to appreciate the underlying craft.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is largely skeptical and critical, with the central theme being the potential that the article is AI-generated "slop." Many commenters found the list's quality to be low, pointing out that the difficulty levels of the suggested projects are inconsistent and the descriptions lack depth, leading one user to compare it to "recommendation porn." This suspicion was amplified by the fact that the article comes from CodeCrafters, a company that has been previously accused of astroturfing on HN.

Despite the criticism of the source article, the conversation pivoted to a broader debate on the value of "building from scratch." Several users championed this practice, using the Japanese concept of "Shugyo" (austere training) to argue that the friction and struggle of such projects build invaluable mental models that AI cannot replicate. However, the most positively received comments were recommendations for alternative resources that users found more practical and inspiring, such as Austin Henley's "Challenging programming projects" and the "Architecture of Open Source Applications" book series. The discussion concluded with a consensus on the value of starting with small, complete projects to achieve the satisfaction of clarity and finishing the entire arc.

## [The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network](https://subseacables.blogspot.com/2025/12/the-british-empires-resilient-subsea.html)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46432999

> **Article:** The article, "The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network," details the vast and strategically vital communication network established by the British Empire. This "All Red Line" system of undersea telegraph cables connected the empire's territories, enabling rapid communication across the globe. The piece highlights the technical and logistical achievements involved in laying and maintaining these cables, which were insulated with a material called Gutta Percha. The network was a cornerstone of imperial power, allowing for swift military, political, and commercial coordination.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing fascination for the history of global communication infrastructure. Many commenters recommend foundational books and articles on the topic, particularly Tom Standage's *The Victorian Internet* and Neal Stephenson's seminal *Wired* article, "Mother Earth, Mother Board." The conversation highlights several key themes:

*   **Personal Connections and Anecdotes:** Users share personal stories of discovering remnants of this history, such as visiting the telegraph museum at Porthcurno in the UK, the cable station in Valentia Island, Ireland, or learning that the town of Alice Springs, Australia, was founded as a repeater station for the overland telegraph line to London.
*   **Technical and Historical Details:** The discussion delves into specifics, such as the use of Gutta Percha for cable insulation and the environmental impact of its harvesting. There is also a comparison of latency, with users noting that the manual repeater stations created significant delays (e.g., 45 minutes for a message to travel from London to Mumbai).
*   **Cultural Impact:** Several comments reflect on how the telegraph network was the "original internet," forcing society to grapple with new concepts like privacy, encryption, and the separation of information from its physical medium.
*   **Related History:** The conversation expands to include the pre-electric semaphore telegraph systems used by the Admiralty in the late 1700s and the later development of transatlantic telephone cables.

## [No strcpy either](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/12/29/no-strcpy-either/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46433029

> **Article:** The article by Daniel Sternberg (author of curl) announces the removal of the last `strcpy` call from the curl codebase. This is part of a long-term effort to eliminate unsafe C string functions. The replacement is a custom function, `curlx_strcopy`, which takes the destination buffer, its size, the source buffer, and the source length. It only performs the copy if the destination is large enough to hold the entire string plus a null terminator. If the check fails, the operation is aborted, the destination is set to an empty string, and the program continues (with a `DEBUGASSERT` for debugging). The motivation is twofold: to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities and to stop AI-powered vulnerability scanners from generating "hallucinated" bug reports that fixate on the presence of `strcpy` without understanding the context.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the effectiveness of the change, the problem of AI-generated security reports, and the nuances of C string handling.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the design of the new `curlx_strcopy` function. Several commenters criticized its behavior: it returns `void` instead of an error code, and on failure, it truncates the destination to an empty string rather than leaving it untouched. This was seen as potentially error-prone and not a clear improvement over other methods.

The article's mention of "AI slop" in vulnerability reports sparked considerable commentary. Users shared the maintainers' frustration with low-quality, AI-generated reports submitted for bounties. However, others pointed out that the article also credits a "new breed" of high-quality AI analyzers for finding hundreds of real bugs, creating a nuanced picture of AI's role in security. A humorous note was a link to an AI-generated report that, while initially dismissed, was ironically prescient in its conclusion that removing `strcpy` would reduce bug reports.

Finally, there was a broader discussion on C string safety, with some commenters arguing that the root issue is the C string model itself and advocating for length-prefixed string libraries. Others provided historical context for functions like `strncpy`, clarifying its original purpose for fixed-width, null-padded fields, which is often misunderstood.

## [Honey's Dieselgate: Detecting and tricking testers](https://vptdigital.com/blog/honey-detecting-testers/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46438522

> **Article:** The article, authored by Ben Edelman, exposes deceptive practices by the Honey browser extension, likening its behavior to the Volkswagen "Dieselgate" scandal. Honey, a popular coupon-finder tool, is accused of "cookie stuffing" – inserting its own affiliate link at checkout to claim commissions on sales it didn't genuinely facilitate. The core of the exposé is a "selective stand down" feature: Honey's code was designed to detect when it was being tested (e.g., by an affiliate network's quality assurance team) and would behave correctly in those instances to avoid being flagged. However, for regular users, Honey would override existing affiliate cookies, depriving other affiliates of their revenue. The article also details how Honey allegedly collected discount codes from users and then pressured merchants to remove those codes from their sites.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with several key themes emerging. A primary point of conversation is the technical nature of Honey's alleged "cookie stuffing" and "selective stand down" mechanisms, with many commenters expressing surprise that such an old tactic is still in use. The discussion is heavily contextualized by a viral YouTube video from MegaLag, which many users referenced as the source of their awareness; the article's author, Ben Edelman, was a featured expert in that video. There is a notable debate over the "Dieselgate" analogy, with some arguing it's a hyperbolic comparison given the low stakes of affiliate marketing versus environmental pollution, while others defend it as a valid comparison of deceptive corporate engineering. Commenters also explored the ethical implications for the engineers who built these systems, with some expressing disbelief at their lack of a moral compass and others offering pragmatic explanations related to job security and corporate pressure. Finally, the conversation touched on the broader issues of affiliate marketing's inherent conflicts of interest, the weakness of app store approvals, and a common initial misunderstanding that the article was about food adulteration rather than a tech company.

## [Win32 is the stable Linux ABI](https://loss32.org/)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 1 | **ID:** 46433035

> **Article:** The article "Win32 is the stable Linux ABI" argues that the Win32 API has effectively become a more stable and reliable Application Binary Interface (ABI) for Linux than the native Linux kernel ABI itself. The author contends that the Linux kernel developers' policy of not maintaining a stable internal kernel ABI forces application developers to rely on higher-level abstractions. While glibc and other user-space libraries aim to provide a stable POSIX-like interface, they are subject to their own churn and dependencies.

In contrast, Microsoft has a strong commitment to backward compatibility for the Win32 API, ensuring that applications compiled decades ago can still run. This stability, combined with the robust compatibility layer provided by Wine and Proton, makes targeting the Win32 API a viable strategy for developing long-lasting, portable software that runs on Linux. The author posits that by building applications to run on Windows (via Wine), developers can paradoxically achieve better cross-platform stability on Linux than by trying to write "native" Linux applications that depend on the ever-shifting landscape of Linux desktop APIs and the kernel interface.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with many users challenging the article's central premise while others defend its underlying logic.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the definition of "ABI." Many commenters argue that the author conflates a stable *API* (Application Programming Interface) with a stable *ABI* (Application Binary Interface). They point out that the Win32 API is a high-level interface, whereas the Linux kernel ABI is a low-level system call interface. The Linux kernel's syscalls are, in fact, remarkably stable; a binary from 1996 can often still make its original syscalls on a modern kernel. The instability comes from the kernel's internal, non-public interfaces intended for kernel modules, not from the user-space system call boundary. Therefore, they argue, the article's title is fundamentally misleading.

Another major theme is the comparison between native Linux development and the Wine/Proton ecosystem. Proponents of the article's view highlight the success of Valve's Proton in running complex Windows games on Linux as evidence of the Win32 ecosystem's robustness. They argue that for many developers, especially in gaming, targeting this stable, well-documented Windows API is a more practical path to Linux compatibility than navigating the fragmented world of Linux desktop toolkits and libraries. Critics counter that this is a workaround for a compatibility layer, not a primary development strategy. They champion native Linux development, citing the stability of POSIX standards and the power of containerization (like Flatpak) to solve dependency and ABI issues for applications.

Finally, the discussion touches on the practical realities for developers. Some developers share anecdotes of the immense effort required to maintain native Linux applications across different distributions, agreeing that the Win32 approach can seem appealingly simple. Others argue that modern Linux development with containers has largely solved these problems, making the "Win32 as a stable ABI" argument a relic of a past era. The debate ultimately boils down to a philosophical clash: whether it's better to embrace a cross-platform compatibility layer for stability or to build directly against the native, but evolving, platform APIs.

## [Approachable Swift Concurrency](https://fuckingapproachableswiftconcurrency.com/en/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46432916

> **Article:** The article "Approachable Swift Concurrency" is a guide to Swift's modern concurrency features, likely using a direct and informal style (indicated by the original title). It aims to demystify concepts like `async`/`await`, actors, and structured concurrency, providing practical examples and explanations to help developers understand and correctly implement concurrent code in Swift. The focus is on making a complex topic more understandable and less intimidating.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the complexities and trade-offs of modern concurrency models, particularly in Swift. A central point of debate is the fundamental nature of `async/await`. One commenter clarifies that it's primarily a mechanism for suspending and resuming work on the *same* thread, which simplifies data access, while another counters that in practice, most language implementations (including Swift's default) use work-stealing executors that *do* move tasks between threads, making the single-threaded model an uncommon case.

This leads to a broader conversation about the difficulty of truly mastering concurrency. One user offers a practical framework: first understand the shape of execution (what can run in parallel), then define ownership (who can touch what data), and only then worry about syntax. This reflects a desire for robust mental models over just learning language features.

Opinions on Swift's specific implementation are sharply divided. Some developers find the syntax, especially with actors, to be "shoehorned" and overly complex, with too many keywords and changing semantics. They express a preference for older models like Combine or GCD. Conversely, others praise Swift's concurrency for its conciseness and expressiveness, especially when compared to the verbosity of Go's error handling for similar tasks. The discussion also touches on the philosophical tension between the "sequential-looking" nature of async/await, which some find misleading, and its utility in managing complex state machines without resorting to explicit callbacks.
