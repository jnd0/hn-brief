## [OpenAI's cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/12/30/openais-cash-burn-will-be-one-of-the-big-bubble-questions-of-2026)
**Score:** 469 | **Comments:** 679 | **ID:** 46438390

> **Article:** The Economist article (dated Dec 30, 2025) posits that OpenAI's massive "cash burn" will be a defining test of the AI market's stability in 2026. It frames the company's strategy as a high-stakes gamble: spending enormous capital to build infrastructure and maintain a lead, betting that rapid user adoption will soon translate into sustainable profitability. The article questions whether this spending is a necessary investment in a revolutionary technology or the hallmark of an unsustainable bubble, suggesting that 2026 will be the year the market forces a verdict on OpenAI's path to revenue.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is highly skeptical of the article's premise and OpenAI's financial outlook. A central theme is the debate over whether OpenAI's spending is truly "burning" money or simply transferring wealth to infrastructure providers like Nvidia. Many commenters argue that the company lacks a clear path to profitability and is operating on hype, with some suggesting the ultimate goal is to become "too big to fail" and secure a government bailout.

Several users challenged the underlying assumptions of the article. One commenter argued that OpenAI hasn't incurred massive new training costs recently, as newer models are largely refinements of GPT-4. Others debated the valuation, comparing OpenAI's multi-hundred-billion-dollar figure to the entire global chocolate market to highlight its perceived absurdity.

The discussion also branched into related topics. A sub-thread debated the viability of government-run AI compute infrastructure, with most agreeing it would lead to inefficiency and political favoritism. There was also a sharp disagreement over Google's success in the AI product space, with one user claiming Google struggles to build desirable products, while another countered that its AI integrations (like AI Overviews in Search) already dwarf the competition in usage.

## [Stardew Valley developer made a $125k donation to the FOSS C# framework MonoGame](https://monogame.net/blog/2025-12-30-385-new-sponsor-announcement/)
**Score:** 437 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46445068

> **Article:** The article announces that ConcernedApe, the solo developer behind the massively successful game *Stardew Valley*, has made a $125,000 donation to MonoGame. MonoGame is the open-source, cross-platform framework that *Stardew Valley* was built with. The donation is intended to fund the development and maintenance of the framework, ensuring its continued health for the developer community.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with many commenters expressing admiration for ConcernedApe's generosity and recognizing it as a significant contribution from an individual developer that rivals or exceeds those of large corporations.

A central theme was the financial context of the donation. Users noted that *Stardew Valley* has sold over 40 million units, generating an estimated half-billion dollars in revenue. From this perspective, the $125,000 donation was seen as a very wise and relatively small investment to ensure the long-term stability of the core engine his product relies on.

The discussion also delved into the nature of MonoGame itself. It was clarified that MonoGame is a framework, not a full-fledged engine like Unity or Unreal. It provides the essential building blocks (like graphics, audio, and input) but requires developers to write the game's architecture and logic from the ground up. This "code-first" approach was highlighted as a key reason developers who enjoy understanding how things work under the hood are drawn to it.

Several users drew parallels to other successful indie studios that have given back to their open-source tools, such as Re-Logic (Terraria) donating to Godot and FNA. This was framed as a positive trend of successful commercial projects supporting the open-source ecosystem that made them possible.

Finally, a minor debate emerged about the choice of C#. While one user questioned why not use alternatives like Lua (LÖVE) or Java (libGDX), others defended C# as a powerful, modern, and open-source language with excellent tooling, making it a strong choice for large-scale projects.

## [Honey's Dieselgate: Detecting and tricking testers](https://vptdigital.com/blog/honey-detecting-testers/)
**Score:** 351 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46438522

> **Article:** The article by Ben Edelman, titled "Honey's Dieselgate," alleges that the Honey browser extension (owned by PayPal) engages in deceptive affiliate marketing practices. The core accusation is that Honey uses a "selective stand down" algorithm. While it claims to "stand down" and not claim a commission if it detects an affiliate link is already present, the article claims Honey intentionally avoids standing down for regular users to maximize its own revenue.

Furthermore, the article accuses Honey of "shaking down" merchants by collecting all discount codes users enter, including private employee codes, and then demanding merchants pay Honey to have those codes removed from the platform. Edelman compares this corporate behavior to Volkswagen's "Dieselgate" scandal, arguing that Honey engineers are knowingly building systems to evade compliance and defraud other affiliates.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of Honey's business practices, though opinions vary on the severity of the issue. The community reaction can be broken down into a few key themes:

*   **Validation and Context:** Many users confirmed the allegations, referencing a viral YouTube video by MegaLag that exposed similar behavior. Several commenters noted that Honey was originally a price-tracking site that was banned by Amazon for abuse, pivoting to the coupon model that eventually led to its $4 billion acquisition by PayPal.
*   **Technical and Ethical Analysis:** Commenters expressed shock that "cookie stuffing" and affiliate fraud are still prevalent. There was specific discussion about the "selective stand down" feature, with some engineers questioning how their peers could implement such a feature without an "are we the baddies?" moment. However, others countered that economic pressures and job security often force engineers to comply with unethical corporate mandates.
*   **Severity and Impact:** A debate emerged regarding the comparison to Volkswagen's emissions scandal. While some argued the analogy is hyperbolic because affiliate fraud is less harmful than air pollution, others defended the comparison as a valid way to illustrate the intentional engineering of systems to evade detection and compliance.
*   **Platform Responsibility:** Several users criticized Google and the Chrome Web Store for allowing such extensions to operate, viewing it as evidence that app store approvals are ineffective at policing bad actors.
*   **Clarifications:** Users clarified that the "twitching" archive link was likely due to the original site's aggressive anti-scraping or ad scripts, not the archive's fault.

## [Show HN: Use Claude Code to Query 600 GB Indexes over Hacker News, ArXiv, etc.](https://exopriors.com/scry)
**Score:** 247 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46442245

> **Project:** The project, "Scry," is a tool that allows users to query a massive 600 GB index of data from Hacker News, ArXiv, LessWrong, and other sources. It uses a Large Language Model (specifically, Claude Code) to translate natural language questions into a combination of SQL and vector queries. This approach enables complex, semantic searches across the datasets, such as finding discussions on specific topics or analyzing trends. The tool is presented as a quick-to-use web interface with a public API key for a frictionless demo, aiming to be a state-of-the-art research assistant.
>
> **Discussion:** The community's reaction is a mix of technical appreciation and practical concerns, with a strong recurring theme around the project's business model and accessibility.

There is significant praise for the core technical approach of using an LLM as a "translator" to generate SQL queries, rather than relying on a black-box chatbot. This is seen as a robust and correct way to handle structured data. However, a major point of concern for many users is the project's closed-source nature and reliance on a third-party service. Multiple commenters express a strong desire for an open-source version, citing a reluctance to share API keys or depend on an external service. The developer's responses reveal they are in "survival mode" financially and are considering open-sourcing once they are more stable, highlighting the tension between productizing a project and community expectations.

Other key discussion points include:
*   **Cost and Model Choice:** Some users are hesitant to use their own paid API credits (like Claude's) and suggest support for self-hosted, open-source models, though the developer notes the system is just a prompt and can be adapted.
*   **Technical Nuances:** A technical discussion emerged about "semantic bleeding," where a word like "optimization" has different meanings across different domains (e.g., ArXiv vs. HN). It was suggested that the quality of the embedding model is key to handling this.
*   **Skepticism and Onboarding:** While some were skeptical of hyperbolic claims like "AGI," others praised the simple and effective onboarding flow, comparing the "prompt + tool" model to the "curl | bash" method for its low friction in enabling new capabilities.

## [Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design [pdf]](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~elec399/201409/Akin%27s%20Laws%20of%20Spacecraft%20Design.pdf)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 57 | **ID:** 46442903

> **Article:** The linked PDF, "Akin's Laws of Spacecraft Design," is a collection of 34 aphorisms and principles for engineering complex systems, written by David Akin. Originally created for his spacecraft design students, the laws offer practical wisdom on the realities of engineering, covering topics like design philosophy, the importance of testing, the inevitability of trade-offs, the relationship between engineering and management, and the nature of failure. The laws emphasize that engineering is a process of managing constraints and uncertainty, not just pure optimization. For example, "The first law of spacecraft design is: 'Physics is the law. Everything else is a recommendation.'" and "A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the document's relevance, with many users noting that the laws, despite originating in 2003, are timeless and highly applicable to software development. A central theme is the parallel between spacecraft engineering and software engineering, with users highlighting how the laws provide a framework for understanding the trade-offs, risks, and non-deterministic nature of their own field. The conversation also touched on the human and business aspects of engineering, with comments on the difficulty of getting stakeholder buy-in, the challenge of presenting ideas effectively (the "presentation" law), and the tension between measurable metrics and intuitive "gut feeling." Some users debated specific examples from the laws, like the N95 vs. iPhone, while others appreciated the philosophical depth, such as the idea that "quality thinking is more important than fast thinking."

## [Everything as code: How we manage our company in one monorepo](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/everything-as-code-monorepo)
**Score:** 218 | **Comments:** 197 | **ID:** 46437381

> **Article:** The article "Everything as code: How we manage our company in one monorepo" details the author's approach to managing their entire company (Kasava) from a single Git repository. This "monorepo" contains not just application code for the front-end and back-end, but also marketing content, business plans, and documentation. The author highlights several benefits, including simplified context management for AI coding tools like Claude, ensuring front-end and back-end changes are always in sync, and eliminating synchronization issues between different parts of the business. They use a "no workspaces" approach with simple subfolders and have a single deployment pipeline, arguing this maximizes velocity for a small team.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a strong split in opinion, heavily influenced by the rise of AI coding tools and the scale of the organization. A significant theme is the newfound appeal of monorepos for AI-assisted development. Several users, including giancarlostoro and emzo, explain that monorepos make it much easier for tools like Claude Code to understand the entire codebase context, which is a powerful new workflow. This practical benefit for AI is a compelling reason to adopt a monorepo that wasn't as prominent in past debates.

However, the traditional debate between monorepos and multi-repos (or polyrepos) is still very much alive. Proponents of multi-repos, like reactordev and dheera, argue they are more composable, prevent "scale hell," and encourage shipping well-defined, versioned products rather than entangling codebases. They see monorepos as a path that works for small teams but breaks down at larger scales.

The most critical counterarguments focus on the operational realities of production systems. Users like sethammons and mjr00 strongly challenge the idea of "one change, everywhere, instantly." They point out that for any system with multiple nodes or a database, you cannot deploy application code and database schema changes simultaneously without downtime. This necessitates designing for backwards compatibility and gradual rollouts, which negates some of the perceived simplicity. They argue that the problems of coordinated deployments and API versioning are fundamental to distributed systems, not solved by a monorepo, and that organizational discipline is required regardless of the repository structure. The discussion also touched on concerns about dependency management without formal monorepo tooling and the challenges of involving non-technical team members.

## [Efficient method to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/innovations/efficient-method-capture-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-developed-university-helsinki)
**Score:** 215 | **Comments:** 226 | **ID:** 46444076

> **Article:** Researchers at the University of Helsinki have developed a new material for capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air (Direct Air Capture or DAC). The method uses a solid sorbent material that binds with CO2 and can be regenerated by heating it to a relatively low temperature (around 80°C / 176°F). This is significantly more energy-efficient than many existing DAC technologies that require much higher temperatures to release the captured CO2. The material is also noted for being non-toxic and stable, making it a promising step forward in making carbon capture more viable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding this article is highly skeptical, focusing on the immense economic, logistical, and physical challenges of Direct Air Capture.

A central theme is the economic viability of DAC compared to natural solutions. Commenters immediately question the cost, suggesting that planting trees is likely far cheaper and more economically efficient, as tree farms are profitable businesses. However, others counter that forests alone cannot offset current global emissions and are not a permanent solution, as carbon is re-released when trees die and decompose.

There is significant debate about the fundamental physics and scale of the problem. Several users point out that because CO2 is present in the atmosphere at a very low concentration (~400 parts per million), capturing it requires moving a massive volume of air, which is inherently energy-intensive and expensive. This leads to a strong preference for capturing carbon at its source (e.g., factory smokestacks), where the concentration is much higher.

The discussion also delves into the problem of what to do with the captured CO2. While some mention potential uses like creating synthetic fuels or enhanced oil recovery (which was viewed ironically), the primary focus is on permanent storage. Commenters express deep concern about the safety and permanence of underground CO2 storage, citing the potential for catastrophic leaks similar to the Lake Nyos disaster. Others propose more secure storage methods, such as mineralization in peridotite rock or simply storing the CO2 in bricks in abandoned mines.

Finally, many commenters express a sense of pessimism about the entire endeavor. They argue that even if the capture technology becomes more efficient, the sheer scale of the problem—removing decades of accumulated emissions and accounting for future energy needs—is nearly unfathomable and unlikely to be solved in the near future.

## [Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming](https://codecrafters.io/blog/programming-project-ideas)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46439027

> **Article:** The article from CodeCrafters.io, titled "Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming," presents a large, curated list of programming projects designed to help developers deepen their understanding and appreciation of software engineering. The list covers a wide range of areas, from low-level systems programming (e.g., writing your own `malloc`) to building complex applications and protocols (e.g., a streaming protocol, a BitTorrent client, an emulator). The underlying theme is the "build from scratch" philosophy, suggesting that recreating existing software is a powerful way to learn.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical and skeptical of the article. A significant portion of the comments question the article's authenticity, with many users suspecting it was generated by AI due to its uneven difficulty levels, lack of depth, and generic feel. This skepticism is amplified by accusations of "astroturfing" (marketing disguised as organic posts), with some users pointing to the poster's history.

However, the discussion also contains constructive counterpoints. Several users recommend alternative project lists, such as Austin Henley's "Challenging programming projects," which they find more concise and practical. Others suggest diving into the source code of established open-source applications via "The Architecture of Open Source Applications" series.

Despite the criticism of the source article, there was a strong consensus on the value of the underlying "build from scratch" principle. One commenter framed this practice as "Shugyo" (a form of austere training), arguing that the friction of manual implementation builds a deep mental model that is invaluable in an era of AI-generated code. The discussion also featured specific project recommendations from users, such as writing a BitTorrent client, which was praised as a rewarding and educational experience.

## [LLVM AI tool policy: human in the loop](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-ai-tool-policy-human-in-the-loop/89159)
**Score:** 209 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46440833

> **Article:** The article is a "Request for Comments" (RFC) on the LLVM project's discourse forum, proposing a new policy for the use of AI tools (like LLMs) in code contribution. The core principle is "human in the loop," meaning contributors are fully responsible for any code they submit, regardless of whether it was generated by an AI. The policy explicitly forbids submitting code that the contributor does not understand and cannot explain. It also bans the use of automated review tools that publish comments without human review, aiming to prevent maintainers from being flooded with low-quality, AI-generated feedback. The goal is to maintain code quality, ensure accountability, and manage the potential influx of low-effort contributions ("slop") while still allowing developers to use AI as a productivity aid.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was overwhelmingly supportive of the policy, with many commenters expressing that such rules should be common sense. A central theme was the frustration with developers who abdicate responsibility for their AI-generated code, using phrases like "I don't know, an LLM did it" as a defense. Commenters argued that the person who submits a pull request is the ultimate owner of the code and must be able to stand behind it, understand it, and answer questions about it. This responsibility was framed as a fundamental professional standard that predates AI.

The policy's ban on automated review bots was debated. While some saw value in them for catching legitimate issues, the consensus was that they are "plausibility engines" and not a substitute for human judgment. A key insight was that human review is not just about finding bugs, but also a valuable process for distributing knowledge among maintainers.

Many commenters shared personal anecdotes of encountering this "slop" at work, expressing a strong desire for their own workplaces to adopt a similar policy. The overall sentiment was that while AI is a powerful tool for increasing productivity, it must be used as an assistant, not a replacement for developer expertise and accountability.

## [Professional software developers don't vibe, they control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14012)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 230 | **ID:** 46437391

> **Article:** The paper "Professional software developers don't vibe, they control" investigates how professional developers integrate "agentic" AI tools (AI integrated into the IDE/terminal that can edit code and run commands) into their workflows. Based on field observations (N=13) and surveys (N=99) conducted in mid-to-late 2025, the authors argue that professional development with AI is distinct from "vibe coding." Instead of delegating entire tasks, professionals use AI as a high-speed assistant while retaining strict control over architecture, testing, and review. The study identifies a workflow where developers steer the AI, constrain its outputs with tests and invariants, and focus on system-level design rather than syntax generation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the validity of the study's methodology, the changing nature of the developer role, and the emotional response to the AI transition.

**Methodological Skepticism**
A primary point of contention was the sample size. Several users noted that 13 observations and 99 survey respondents are not statistically significant, though others countered that significance depends on the effect size being measured. There was also appreciation for the study's timeliness, as it captured the state of the art in late 2025 (GPT-5, Sonnet 4), avoiding the typical lag of academic publishing.

**"Steering" vs. "Vibe Coding"**
Commenters resonated with the paper's distinction between writing syntax and "steering systems." Many senior developers felt this validated their current reality: their job has shifted from typing code to reviewing, architecting, and constraining AI outputs. The consensus was that the real skill gap is not prompt engineering, but the ability to recognize when an AI is confidently wrong and how to fence it in with tests and architecture.

**Workflow and Responsibility**
There was significant frustration regarding the "hand-off" dynamic. One user highlighted a survey statistic showing that while many developers use AI for building apps, very few use it for testing. This led to a complaint that developers are creating a culture where they generate code without verifying it, burdening others with review. The sentiment was that "nobody wants to be a full-time code reviewer," and some admitted to firing employees for relying too heavily on unchecked AI output.

**Emotional and Philosophical Resistance**
A distinct theme was the rejection of the "AI-or-bust" narrative. Several developers expressed a deep love for the craft of coding itself, stating they would rather flip burgers or code as a hobby than be forced to use agentic workflows they find tedious or unenjoyable. There was also a counter-narrative to the idea that AI will make developers obsolete, with users pointing out that open source historically increased the value of software engineering, and that the profession isn't driving itself to irrelevance just yet.

## [Sabotaging Bitcoin](https://blog.dshr.org/2025/12/sabotaging-bitcoin.html)
**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46437876

> **Article:** The article "Sabotaging Bitcoin" analyzes a theoretical attack on the Bitcoin network that is cheaper and more subtle than a traditional 51% attack. The author, David Gerard, outlines a strategy where an attacker with significant but not majority mining power (e.g., 30%) can intentionally orphan blocks created by other miners. By doing so, the attacker can cause massive disruption and erode confidence in the network's stability. The post argues that the cost to execute such an attack is surprisingly low—estimated in the low billions of dollars—making it a plausible threat for a state-level actor or a well-funded entity. The author suggests this vulnerability is a fundamental weakness of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work model and highlights the immense economic damage that could be inflicted on Bitcoin's derivatives market, which is vastly larger than the spot market.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a multifaceted and polarized debate on Bitcoin's security, efficiency, and future. A significant portion of the conversation centers on the immense energy consumption of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism. Commenters expressed shock at the scale of energy use, with some highlighting the efficiency of alternative platforms like Hedera, while others argued that Bitcoin uniquely incentivizes the use of otherwise wasted or stranded energy sources, a nuance they feel is often missed in mainstream critiques.

The technical feasibility and economics of the proposed attack were heavily scrutinized. Some users, referencing the original Bitcoin whitepaper, suggested a straightforward defense: increasing the number of required confirmations for finality. However, others countered that this would be socially and logistically difficult to implement, especially in a crisis. A recurring counter-argument was that the attack is not economically viable for the perpetrator, as the cost of constantly mining with a large pool (and wasting blocks) would likely exceed any potential profit from a double-spend, especially when compared to simply using the hardware to mine honestly.

The discussion also branched into broader geopolitical and systemic concerns. The concentration of mining hardware manufacturing (e.g., Bitmain) and mining power in China led one commenter to conclude that Bitcoin is effectively controlled by the CCP, making it a "shitshow." The sheer size of the Bitcoin derivatives market ($1.7T vs. $1.8B spot) was noted with alarm, as it represents a massive attack surface for financial disruption. Finally, there was a debate on Bitcoin's long-term security model, with some arguing that diminishing block rewards will inevitably weaken the network, while others insisted that security is tied to the USD value of rewards and that a fee market will eventually stabilize the system.

## [The rise of industrial software](https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/12/30/the-rise-of-industrial-software)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 137 | **ID:** 46442597

> **Article:** The article "The rise of industrial software" argues that software development is undergoing a fundamental shift akin to the Industrial Revolution. The author posits that AI tools like Codex and Claude are the new "assembly lines," moving software creation from a bespoke, artisanal craft to a mass-production model. This will lead to an explosion of "disposable software"—cheap, single-purpose applications designed for specific, short-term needs. The author draws parallels to other industrialized sectors, noting that while industrialization increases volume and reach, it often prioritizes quantity and low cost over the quality and durability characteristic of artisanal work. The article suggests that while this will democratize software creation, it will also fundamentally change the nature of software, the economy around it, and the role of the human developer.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with debate centering on the validity of the industrialization analogy and the likely impact on software quality.

A significant portion of the comments challenge the article's premise, arguing that the "industrial revolution" in software already happened decades ago with the advent of high-level languages, open-source libraries, and containerization. Skeptics also question whether AI tools truly represent an exponential leap or just a linear improvement, with some suggesting the current hype is a bubble fueled by subsidized costs rather than a genuine flywheel of innovation. Several long-time developers expressed skepticism about the revolutionary nature of AI, stating that their core work—data processing, modeling, and understanding complex systems—remains largely unchanged, with AI merely making certain tasks faster rather than fundamentally altering their role.

The most heated debate revolves around the "junkification" thesis. The author's analogy that industrialization leads to low-quality outputs (like fast fashion or processed food) was heavily contested. Critics argued this was a flawed and overly negative view, pointing out that industrialization also enables mass literacy, ends hunger, and produces goods of superior quality and consistency compared to artisanal methods. They asserted that mass production allows for extreme quality control, and the real driver of "junk" is market demand for cheapness, not an inherent property of industrial systems.

Finally, there was a nuanced discussion on the nature of software itself. One commenter introduced the concept of a "Knowledge Pool," arguing that the hidden cost of software is user retraining, and stable interfaces are crucial for productivity—a point countered by others who noted that both proprietary and open-source software can be unstable. While some see AI enabling a new class of "disposable" software to solve niche, fragmented problems that were previously uneconomical, others remain unconvinced, arguing that most people's software needs are already met and that core requirements like security and maintainability are antithetical to a "disposable" model.

## [Quality of drinking water varies significantly by airline](https://foodmedcenter.org/2026-center-for-food-as-medicine-longevity-airline-water-study/)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46439769

> **Article:** The article from the "Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity" reports on a study of drinking water quality on US airlines. It finds significant variation in water safety, with major airlines like Delta and Frontier receiving high grades (A), while others like American Airlines and JetBlue receive low grades (D). The study is based on testing samples from aircraft water tanks. The article advises passengers to avoid drinking tap water, coffee, or tea on board, and to use bottled water for drinking and brushing teeth. It also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead of washing hands in the plane's lavatory.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the source article, focusing on the questionable quality of the advice and the credibility of the publishing organization. A key point of contention is the recommendation to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer instead of washing hands with water. Commenters point out that alcohol is ineffective against certain pathogens like norovirus and does not remove physical grime, making soap and water essential.

There is significant skepticism directed at the "Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity," with users flagging the name as a potential indicator of pseudoscience. The article's advice is also scrutinized for being impractical or poorly explained; for instance, one user questions the recommendation to drink only bottled water when some airlines already serve canned water. The discussion also challenges the article's specific warnings against coffee and tea, arguing that boiling water temperatures should be sufficient to kill most bacteria, though another user counters that toxins could still remain.

The conversation is punctuated by skepticism about the article's data, with one user correctly predicting that American Airlines would be ranked last and another pointing out a confusing "2026" date on the study. The overall consensus is that while the underlying issue of airline water quality may be valid, this particular article and its advice are unreliable.

The treatment, which targets a specific protein (USAG-1) that inhibits tooth development, is expected to result in a full set of new teeth within 4 years of starting the therapy. The initial trials are focused on safety and dosage, with plans to expand to broader efficacy trials in the future. The ultimate goal is to provide a revolutionary alternative to dentures and implants for people with missing teeth.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and analytical, with users questioning the article's reporting and exploring the practical implications of the technology. A primary point of confusion was the article's timeline; several users pointed out that the mentioned "human trials" are likely a Phase 1 trial focused on safety and dosage, not a proof of efficacy, and that the results are still far off. This reflects a common sentiment that such futuristic medical breakthroughs are often overhyped in popular media, with some commenters comparing the "4 years away" claim to the perpetual promise of fusion energy.

Beyond the skepticism, the conversation branched into several other areas:
*   **Practical Concerns:** Users questioned how the new teeth would fit correctly, given that dental structure is unique to each individual and teeth wear down over time. There was also a humorous but genuine fear of uncontrolled growth, such as teeth appearing in the wrong places or even a "haircut made of teeth."
*   **Alternative Health Anecdotes:** One commenter shared a personal, positive experience with Vitamin K2 for dental health, which led to a brief sub-thread where others corroborated its benefits for tooth strength and cleanliness.
*   **Related Technologies:** The discussion also touched upon the difficulty of regenerating other tissues like hair and limbs, as well as alternative methods for enamel restoration, showing a broader interest in the field of regenerative medicine.

>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the enduring value of the Red Book, speculation about a future 6th edition, and practicalities of accessing the referenced materials. Users express appreciation for the book's direct, content-focused website, contrasting it with modern marketing-heavy tech sites.

Key themes include:
*   **Content for a 6th Edition:** Commenters suggest that a new edition should cover modern developments like vector databases, object storage and data lakes (e.g., Parquet, Iceberg), NewSQL systems (CockroachDB, TiDB), and incremental view maintenance.
*   **Accessing Papers:** A sub-thread discusses how to handle the book's links to Google Scholar rather than direct PDFs. Suggestions ranged from using AI agents to automate the search process to using Sci-Hub to bypass paywalls.
*   **Historical Context:** Some users noted the generic nature of the "redbook.io" domain, comparing it to other famous "Red Books" like IBM's networking documentation or the NSA's security guidelines.

## [I canceled my book deal](https://austinhenley.com/blog/canceledbookdeal.html)
**Score:** 127 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46446815

> **Article:** Austin Henley recounts his experience of canceling a book deal for a technical book on classic programming projects. The contract offered a $5,000 advance, with the first half payable only after the publisher approved the first third of the manuscript. Henley fell behind on revisions due to a heavy workload, a potential job change, and his upcoming wedding. He proposed "freezing" the project, which the publisher agreed to. Henley concluded that he no longer enjoyed the work and decided to formally cancel the deal. He clarifies that he never received any part of the advance and therefore did not have to return any funds.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the practical and ethical implications of the book deal's cancellation, the publisher's motivations, and the broader state of technical publishing. Many commenters initially questioned whether Henley had to return the advance, but it was clarified that he never received it, as the first payment was contingent on submitting an approved draft. Users noted that the publisher's suggestion to "freeze" the contract rather than cancel it outright was a common tactic to avoid immediate financial loss.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the publisher's new policy to "involve AI" in all future books. Several users expressed concern that this represents a shift towards chasing trends over quality. One commenter speculated that this could be a deliberate strategy to pressure inexperienced authors into quitting before they become eligible for their first advance payment. Another user shared that adding AI chapters has become an industry-wide trend for new technical books.

Other themes included the challenges of authorship, with one user relating to the difficulty of the actual work versus the idea of it. There was also advice for the author to self-publish, with the consensus being that traditional publishers are best for marketing and production, while the author retains control over the content. Finally, some commenters expressed interest in Henley's book concept and encouraged him to finish it independently.

## [2025 was a disaster for Windows 11](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/2025-has-been-an-awful-year-for-windows-11-with-infuriating-bugs-and-constant-unwanted-features)
**Score:** 123 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46445491

> **Article:** The article from Windows Central argues that 2025 has been an exceptionally bad year for Windows 11. The author details a series of major, disruptive bugs introduced by updates, such as one that crippled gaming performance by up to 50%, another that caused SSDs to fail or become unrecognizable, and a third that caused instability on specific hardware. Beyond these critical failures, the article criticizes Microsoft's focus on pushing unwanted features and AI integration ("Copilot") at the expense of core system stability and user experience. The author frames this as a result of Microsoft prioritizing its AI ambitions and "enshittification" over the quality of its flagship operating system, leaving users frustrated and questioning their platform loyalty.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's claims, with users expressing widespread frustration with the current state of Windows 11. A central theme is the decline in quality control, with one highly upvoted comment attributing this to Microsoft moving testing in-house to the release team, creating a conflict of interest where deadlines trump exhaustive testing.

Users point to specific pain points beyond the article's scope, including sluggish performance of core components like Explorer and the Start Menu, intrusive data harvesting, and ads within a paid OS. The aggressive push of AI features like Copilot is a major point of contention, with many users stating they want their OS to be a stable platform, not an AI-integrated service. This has led to a growing sentiment that Microsoft is "abandoning" its core user base in favor of chasing AI trends.

As a result, a significant portion of the discussion revolves around the viability of alternatives, particularly Linux. Users express a desire to switch but are often held back by professional software (like CAD) or gaming compatibility. However, there's optimism about the progress of tools like Proton for gaming and a belief that Microsoft's missteps are accelerating Linux's maturity as a desktop alternative. The consensus is that Microsoft's focus on extracting value and pushing unwanted features is creating a "hostage" situation, pushing even long-time Windows users to actively look for the exits.
