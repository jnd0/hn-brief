# Hacker News Summary - 2025-12-31

## [Netflix Open Content](https://opencontent.netflix.com/)
**Score:** 628 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46431560

> **Article:** The article links to Netflix's "Open Content" portal, a site that provides open access to assets used for testing media pipelines. This includes test footage, audio files, and other resources that Netflix uses internally. The stated purpose is to foster the development of video codecs and related technologies, ultimately improving compression and reducing bandwidth costs for the industry, including Netflix itself. The content is not new, with the last update noted as being in 2020.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely a critical examination of the Netflix Open Content page rather than an analysis of the content itself. A primary point of criticism is the poor quality and outdated nature of the website. Commenters note that the last update was in 2020, the design looks like a "free template," and it lacks modern security standards, with download links using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS. This leads to speculation that the project is an abandoned or low-priority "pet project" with no internal funding.

Technical and corporate motivations are also debated. While some see it as a genuine open-source contribution to help the industry develop better codecs, which would benefit Netflix through lower bandwidth costs, others question its purpose, suggesting it might be for simple compliance or PR. A notable observation is that the site routes its own links through Google's URL shortener for tracking, a detail users found odd.

Broader conversations touch on the stagnation of innovation in online video compared to physical media (like DVDs with their bonus features) and the lack of similar open content initiatives for other media like music. A more recent and related project, the ASWF Digital Production Example Library (DPEL), is also mentioned as a source for more current Netflix content.

## [Show HN: 22 GB of Hacker News in SQLite](https://hackerbook.dosaygo.com)
**Score:** 480 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46435308

> **Project:** The project is "HackerBook," a 22 GB archive of Hacker News data distributed as a SQLite database. The key technical feature is that it runs entirely in the browser using WebAssembly (SQL.js). To avoid forcing users to download a massive file, the database is split into 1,636 small "shards." The application dynamically fetches only the specific shards required for the user's current view or query. This allows for an offline-capable, interactive experience (including a raw SQL query interface) that would otherwise be impossible with a database of this size in a web browser.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction was highly technical, focusing on the implementation details and potential alternatives.

Several users noted that the GitHub repository linked in the post was returning a 404 error, making the source code inaccessible. There was also a brief, minor debate over whether the project's marketing text was AI-generated, though most commenters focused on the technology.

The most significant discussion point was the technical architecture. A user pointed out that the sharding approach is similar to a known project, `sql.js-httpvfs`, which uses HTTP range requests to query a single large file without downloading it entirely. The author confirmed they were not familiar with DuckDB, a popular columnar store, and had chosen SQLite for its simplicity.

Other key points included:
*   **Data Accessibility:** Users discussed the availability of HN data, with one mentioning the official BigQuery dataset and another sharing their own experience importing massive Reddit datasets into SQLite.
*   **Practical Use Cases:** A prominent suggestion was to package the data as a `.zim` file, which would allow it to be read offline using existing applications like Kiwix (popular for offline Wikipedia).
*   **Performance:** A user with experience in similar projects shared that for large SQLite databases, running `VACUUM` after import significantly improves query performance, though it takes a long time to complete.

## [Go away Python](https://lorentz.app/blog-item.html?id=go-shebang)
**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 347 | **ID:** 46431028

> **Article:** The article "Go away Python" proposes using Go for shell scripting via a clever shebang hack. The author demonstrates a method to make a Go source file directly executable without a separate compilation step. The trick involves a shebang line that executes the script itself using `go run`, while the Go compiler ignores the shebang because it's treated as a valid comment syntax (`//`). The resulting file can be run like a script, offering Go's static typing and performance for tasks typically handled by Python or Bash.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the technical feasibility of the shebang hack but questions its practicality. While several users noted that similar techniques exist for C, .NET, and Java, the core debate centered on the "ergonomics" of using a compiled language for scripting.

Commentators identified two main friction points:
1. **Dependency Management:** While the hack works for standard library code, handling third-party dependencies remains complex. Users noted that tools like `uv` for Python offer a smoother experience for script-based dependency management than Go's module system.
2. **Development Workflow:** A recurring theme was the psychological mismatch between Go and scripting. Users argued that Go encourages rigorous engineering (tests, build pipelines, error handling), whereas scripting requires a "quick and dirty" approach. The consensus was that while Go is excellent for shippable software, languages like Python or Bash remain superior for ad-hoc tasks due to their lower ceremony and faster iteration cycles.

## [Nicolas Guillou, French ICC judge sanctioned by the US and “debanked”](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/19/nicolas-guillou-french-icc-judge-sanctioned-by-the-us-you-are-effectively-blacklisted-by-much-of-the-world-s-banking-system_6747628_4.html)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 393 | **ID:** 46432057

> **Article:** The article from Le Monde profiles Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), who has been sanctioned by the United States. The sanctions, likely under the Global Magnitsky Act, effectively "debank" him, cutting him and his family off from the global financial system. This action was taken in response to the ICC issuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes in Gaza. The piece details the severe personal and professional consequences for Guillou, highlighting how the US is leveraging its financial power to punish officials from an international body for actions it deems politically unfavorable. The article frames this as a major escalation that challenges the principles of international justice and the rule of law.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the US sanctions, viewing them as an abuse of power that undermines international law and US soft power. The conversation is divided into several key themes:

A dominant theme is the hypocrisy and danger of using a human rights sanctions framework against judges tasked with prosecuting human rights violations. Commenters argue this exposes the "rules-based order" as a tool of foreign policy rather than a consistent legal principle, eroding the legitimacy of international institutions. Many point to similar US actions against a Brazilian Supreme Court Justice as evidence that this is a pattern of bullying to protect political allies and interests, not a principled stand on human rights.

Another major thread discusses the long-term consequences for the US dollar's dominance. Several users suggest that weaponizing the financial system against even high-profile figures like ICC judges will accelerate efforts by other nations to create alternative financial systems, ultimately weakening America's global influence.

A smaller, but vocal, contingent defends the US position, arguing that the ICC has no jurisdiction over non-signatory nations like the US and Israel. They frame the ICC's actions as "picking on" Israel and assert that the US is within its rights to protect its interests and those of its allies.

Finally, the discussion briefly touches on Bitcoin as a potential escape from state-controlled financial systems, though this is quickly met with counterarguments about its volatility, environmental impact, and use in illicit activities. The overall sentiment is one of alarm at the erosion of international legal norms and the unchecked power of US financial hegemony.

## [A faster heart for F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/2025/12/30/a-faster-heart-for-f-droid.html)
**Score:** 368 | **Comments:** 156 | **ID:** 46436409

> **Article:** The article "A Faster Heart for F-Droid" announces a major hardware upgrade for the F-Droid build servers. The previous server was 12-year-old hardware that had been running for five years and was struggling to build modern Android applications. The post details the challenges of acquiring new hardware amidst global supply chain issues and emphasizes the unique hosting arrangement. The new server is not in a standard commercial data center; instead, it is physically hosted by a trusted, long-time contributor. The F-Droid team frames this as a positive, highlighting that they have full control, know exactly who has physical access, and can manage the server remotely, ensuring a high level of security and trust.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was overwhelmingly critical of the F-Droid team's infrastructure choices, with many commenters expressing alarm rather than celebrating the upgrade. The central point of contention was the revelation that the server is hosted in a private individual's home ("some guy's bedroom" or "basement"), which many perceived as an amateurish, insecure, and single point of failure for a project of F-Droid's stature. This was contrasted with the expectation that a modern project would use a commercial data center or cloud provider for redundancy and professional management.

Commenters were particularly baffled by this decision in light of the fact that F-Droid recently received a $400,000 grant, which should easily cover professional colocation. The lack of transparency about the specific hardware and the exact hosting setup further fueled skepticism. While a few defenders argued that such volunteer-run, simple setups are common and essential for the open-source ecosystem, the prevailing sentiment was that this arrangement is a significant risk and a poor reflection on the project's operational maturity. The discussion also touched on the broader issue of centralization and trust in the F-Droid ecosystem.

## [Non-Zero-Sum Games](https://nonzerosum.games/)
**Score:** 366 | **Comments:** 178 | **ID:** 46432311

> **Article:** The linked website, "Non-Zero-Sum Games," is a blog that uses concepts from game theory to analyze human behavior, social systems, and ethics. The site is noted for its distinctive, whimsical visual design, featuring interactive elements and a unique aesthetic. The articles explore topics such as cooperation vs. competition, the nature of meritocracy, and how to frame societal problems in ways that encourage collaborative, non-zero-sum solutions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is sharply divided between two main threads: an aesthetic critique of the website's design and a philosophical debate on the nature of cooperation and game theory.

A significant portion of the comments focus on the site's presentation. Many users praised the "pretty," "genius," and "well-made" design, appreciating that it stood out from generic "AI slop." However, an equally strong contingent found the design actively hostile to readability, criticizing the fonts as resembling Comic Sans, the animations as distracting, and the color contrast as jarring and fatiguing.

The intellectual discussion centered on the site's core themes. One user sparked a debate by arguing that, in a rational analysis, cheating is a superior strategy because society is forgiving and people are often attracted to or tolerate abusers. This was countered by multiple users who asserted that cooperation is the fundamental basis for human prosperity and civilization, a behavior so successful it has evolved independently many times. They argued that while cheating might benefit an individual in the short term, widespread defection leads to societal collapse, and the stability of our global society is proof of cooperation's long-term dominance.

Further discussion branched into specific articles. The site's take on affirmative action was challenged as mischaracterizing the issue, with a counter-argument that it's a response to an already existing zero-sum game of legacy and social capital. A separate debate on "effortocracy" questioned whether effort has inherent moral value, especially when it doesn't lead to achievement. Finally, a practical point was raised about the necessity of reputation and memory for cooperation in the digital age, with eBay's feedback system cited as a successful example of building trust among strangers.

## [OpenAI's cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/12/30/openais-cash-burn-will-be-one-of-the-big-bubble-questions-of-2026)
**Score:** 312 | **Comments:** 424 | **ID:** 46438390

> **Article:** The Economist article posits that OpenAI's immense cash burn will be a defining "bubble question" of 2026. It frames the company's strategy as a high-stakes gamble: it is spending billions on compute and talent, betting that rapid user adoption will quickly translate into sustainable, high-margin revenue streams (e.g., subscriptions, advertising). The central question is whether this is a viable path to profitability or a sign of an unsustainable bubble, where the massive investment is predicated on a future that may not materialize as quickly or as profitably as hoped.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's premise and OpenAI's financial trajectory. A dominant theme is the critique of OpenAI's valuation and lack of a clear path to profitability. One commenter provocatively compared OpenAI's ~$500B valuation to the entire global chocolate market (~$135B), questioning the rationale and suggesting a potential crash. The term "cash burn" itself was debated, with some clarifying it's standard financial jargon for high spending without returns, while others argued it misrepresents the spending as value destruction when it's actually enriching hardware providers like Nvidia.

There was significant debate about OpenAI's product strategy and innovation. One user claimed OpenAI hasn't trained a new foundational model since GPT-4o, suggesting their runaway training expenses aren't real. This was countered by others pointing to GPT-4.5 and the massive costs of salaries and data centers. While some see a clear path to revenue via advertising, others are more bullish on competitors like Anthropic, whose focus on coding offers a more traditional SaaS business model.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader systemic risks and alternative futures. A prominent thread debated the idea of government-provided AI infrastructure, with one user arguing this would simply shift competition from product innovation to lobbying and political influence. Another commenter suggested the core issue is public expectation; the industry has conditioned users to expect cheap, abundant intelligence, and any slowdown will be perceived as failure, creating the conditions for a bubble to burst.

## [FediMeteo: A €4 FreeBSD VPS Became a Global Weather Service](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/02/26/fedimeteo-how-a-tiny-freebsd-vps-became-a-global-weather-service-for-thousands/)
**Score:** 278 | **Comments:** 66 | **ID:** 46436889

> **Article:** The article details the creation of "FediMeteo," a weather service for the Fediverse (Mastodon, etc.) that was built and scaled on an extremely low-cost €4/month FreeBSD Virtual Private Server (VPS). The author explains the technical stack, which includes using Caddy for web serving and a custom backend to fetch and distribute weather forecasts. Despite its humble beginnings on a machine with 4 shared cores and 4GB of RAM, the service grew to serve thousands of users. The post serves as a case study in efficient software engineering, demonstrating that a small, well-optimized application running on minimal hardware can handle significant traffic without needing to resort to expensive, complex cloud infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively, with commenters praising the project as an inspiring example of what can be achieved with minimal resources. A significant portion of the discussion focused on the incredible value proposition of the €4 VPS, with users actively trying to find the specific provider (netcup) and sharing other resources for finding cheap servers (Lowendbox). The author's choice of FreeBSD also sparked a side discussion, with some users agreeing that it offers less bloat and better performance than typical Linux distributions, while others countered that minimalist Linux distros like Alpine can achieve similar results. The conversation also touched on related topics like the appeal of managing one's own VPS, the importance of accessibility in software, and alternative technical approaches (like using Cloudflare Workers).

## [A Vulnerability in Libsodium](https://00f.net/2025/12/30/libsodium-vulnerability/)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 34 | **ID:** 46435614

> **Article:** The article announces a vulnerability in the widely-used cryptography library Libsodium. The flaw is related to how certain functions handle points on the Curve25519/Edwards25519 curve, specifically concerning the validation of points outside the prime-order subgroup. The author notes that while Libsodium's original design philosophy was to provide high-level, easy-to-use APIs that hide such complexities, users have increasingly adopted it as a low-level toolkit of cryptographic primitives. This shift in usage patterns exposed the library to this class of vulnerability, which can undermine higher-level security assumptions even if an immediate exploit isn't obvious.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical nature of the bug, its widespread impact, and the broader implications for cryptography libraries. A key technical point, raised by a library author (loup-vaillant), was that the vulnerability is primarily a concern for custom protocols built on Curve25519, as the standard X25519 key exchange protocol is inherently safe from this issue because it projects results into the prime-order subgroup.

The community response was swift and collaborative. A prominent commenter (CiPHPerCoder) confirmed the bug also affected a PHP implementation and initiated a broad audit of other open-source Ed25519 libraries to assess the vulnerability's scope. This proactive effort was met with appreciation from other users.

The discussion also highlighted the tension between a library author's original vision and real-world usage. Commenters noted that Libsodium was designed to be a high-level, "batteries-included" library, but its reliability led developers to use it as a collection of low-level primitives, which in turn exposed it to this vulnerability. This was framed as a common lesson in open-source development: user behavior can diverge from the creator's intent, and successful projects adapt to support these emergent use cases. The conversation concluded with praise for the library's creator, Frank Denis, and a brief debate on how large corporations could better support critical open-source maintainers.

## [Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts](https://hsu.cy/2025/12/times-new-american/)
**Score:** 249 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46432862

> **Article:** The article "Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts" analyzes the recent decision by the U.S. State Department to revert from Calibri to Times New Roman for official documents. The author frames this not as a simple aesthetic choice, but as a politically charged move, citing the current administration's criticism of Calibri as a "wasteful diversity" font. The article provides a historical and technical comparison of the two typefaces. It argues that while Times New Roman is traditional and conveys a sense of gravitas, it was designed for print and has digital-era shortcomings (e.g., poor performance at small sizes, limited weights, spacing issues). Conversely, Calibri was designed by LucasFonts for Microsoft specifically for on-screen readability, with superior spacing and performance on standard monitors. The author concludes that the switch is a regression, driven by political ideology rather than typographic merit, and misses an opportunity to choose a truly superior font for modern government communication.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, blending technical typography, political commentary, and historical context. A central theme was the political motivation behind the font change, with many commenters viewing the "DEI font" rationale as a symptom of a culture war and a distraction from more substantive issues. The debate over the fonts' merits was robust: proponents of Calibri cited its superior on-screen legibility and modern design, while defenders of Times New Roman valued its traditional, formal appearance and space-saving properties for print. However, a significant contingent argued that both are poor choices, being overused defaults that signal a lack of thought. Instead, they advocated for alternatives like Palatino, Garamond, or the open-source Public Sans, which was developed by the U.S. government itself. The discussion also delved into broader topics, including the history of serifs, best practices for accessibility (e.g., for dyslexia), and the philosophical question of whether government documents should use libre fonts. The presence of a representative from LucasFonts (Calibri's designer) provided a direct, expert rebuttal to the administration's claims, adding a unique layer to the conversation. Ultimately, the consensus was that the decision was handled poorly, regardless of one's opinion on the fonts themselves.

## [HSBC blocks its app due to F-Droid-installed Bitwarden](https://mastodon.neilzone.co.uk/@neil/115807834298031971)
**Score:** 236 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46431453

> **Article:** The article links to a Mastodon post detailing an issue where the HSBC banking app blocks access on a user's Android device. The block was triggered because the user had Bitwarden, a password manager, installed via F-Droid (an alternative app store). The HSBC app flagged this as a potential security risk, preventing the user from accessing their bank account.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the conflict between bank-mandated security and user control over their own devices. The consensus is that while banks claim these measures are for security, they often function as "security theatre," overly intrusive, and hostile to power users.

Key points from the discussion include:

*   **The Technical Reason:** Users identified that HSBC likely blocks the app due to specific permissions Bitwarden holds, such as the ability to "overlay" other apps. This allows a password manager to auto-fill fields, but banks fear malware could use this to hijack the screen and fake transactions. HSBC uses the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission, which Google allows for financial apps, to scan for apps they deem risky.
*   **Security vs. Control:** There is a debate on whether this is reasonable security practice or overreach. While some argue it's a valid risk management strategy by the bank, others contend it is "security theater." Users argue that better technical solutions exist, such as Android's Protected Confirmation (which uses the TrustZone to create a secure, overlay-proof environment), which banks should adopt instead of blanket-blocking apps.
*   **User Agency and Alternatives:** A major theme is the loss of user freedom. Commenters expressed frustration that banks force users to choose between their banking app and their preferred device setup (e.g., using F-Droid, developer tools, or custom ROMs like GrapheneOS). Proposed solutions included:
    *   Switching to banks with more lenient policies (Monzo is praised for warning users but allowing access).
    *   Using a dedicated "burner" phone solely for banking apps.
    *   Using a work profile to isolate banking apps from the rest of the system.
    *   Abandoning apps entirely in favor of robust web-based banking.
*   **Broader De-banking Concerns:** The conversation expanded to a wider anxiety about "de-banking." Users cited examples of banks closing accounts based on device status (rooted phones) or political sanctions (citing a case of an Italian citizen allegedly debanked due to US pressure), highlighting a fear that financial institutions are becoming gatekeepers of access to essential services based on opaque criteria.

## [Public Sans – A strong, neutral typeface](https://public-sans.digital.gov/)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46433579

> **Article:** The article links to the official page for "Public Sans," a free, open-source typeface developed by the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS). It is described as a "strong, neutral" sans-serif font designed for use in government digital products and public-facing websites. The font is based on the popular open-source font "Inter," and is intended to be a highly legible, versatile, and professional typeface for both text and display purposes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive about the font's quality but quickly branches into related topics of typography and accessibility. A key point of debate is the design of the capital 'I', with one user finding it difficult to distinguish from a lowercase 'l' and championing IBM Plex Sans for its superior glyph differentiation. This sparked a sub-thread of recommendations for other highly legible, open-source fonts like Inter and Atkinson Hyperlegible. Other users compared Public Sans to similar fonts like Roboto and Aptos, with some concluding their differences are minor and largely a matter of preference. The conversation also included a brief, skeptical tangent about the current state of U.S. government digital projects, though others noted the font itself remains freely available on GitHub.

## [NYC Mayoral Inauguration bans Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero alongside explosives](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/12/30/nyc-mayoral-inauguration-bans-raspberry-pi-and-flipper-zero-alongside-explosives/)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 176 | **ID:** 46438828

> **Article:** An article on the Adafruit blog reports that the NYC Mayoral Inauguration security protocols explicitly list Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero devices as prohibited items, placing them in the same category as explosives and weapons. The article frames this as an example of security theater and a misunderstanding of the technology, arguing that banning specific brand names is ineffective when many similar devices exist and that the intent is likely to prohibit any small, custom electronics. The post also criticizes the use of Cloudflare, which blocks some users (including Tor exit nodes and some standard browsers) with CAPTCHAs before they can read the article.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters largely agree that the ban is a misguided example of security theater. There is a consensus that banning specific products like "Raspberry Pi" is ineffective and imprecise, as security personnel will likely just ban any device that looks like a circuit board, while other form factors (like laptops or phones) remain permitted despite having similar capabilities. Some users noted that this is a common issue for travelers carrying development boards, with experiences ranging from no issues to extra scrutiny from TSA.

The ban is also viewed as counter-productive, as it raises awareness of devices like the Flipper Zero, potentially increasing their popularity. A side discussion criticizes the article's host, Adafruit, for using Cloudflare, which blocks access for some users via CAPTCHAs and Tor, undermining the "hacker-friendly" ethos of the post. Ultimately, the prevailing sentiment is that the rule is likely the result of a bureaucrat adding items to a list to appear proactive, rather than a well-thought-out security measure.

## [Everything as code: How we manage our company in one monorepo](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/everything-as-code-monorepo)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 180 | **ID:** 46437381

> **Article:** The article "Everything as code" details how the company Kasava manages its entire operation within a single monorepo. This includes not only the frontend and backend code but also marketing content, business planning, and design documents. The author highlights several key benefits: providing full context to AI coding assistants like Claude Code, eliminating synchronization issues between different codebases, simplifying the development workflow, and enabling atomic commits that span across services. The approach is presented as a way to maximize velocity for a small, agile team by treating every aspect of the business as code that can be version-controlled and managed together.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide on the practicality of monorepos, with the conversation heavily influenced by the presence of AI tools and organizational scale.

A significant portion of the comments, particularly from users like giancarlostoro and emzo, champion the monorepo approach specifically because it works so well with AI coding assistants. Having all code in one place provides these tools with complete context, making them far more effective at understanding and modifying the entire system at once.

However, the primary counterargument centers on scalability and release management. Commenters like sethammons and mjr00 argue that the "one change, everywhere" model is a fallacy that leads to production risk. They point out that you cannot deploy database schema changes and application code simultaneously, and that at scale, a single monorepo can lead to "cross contamination" and organizational bottlenecks where one team's needs hold back the entire company. This perspective is reinforced by skepticism about the author's company size, suggesting the approach works for startups but may not be viable for large, mission-critical systems.

A secondary debate revolves around the classic monorepo vs. multirepo (polyrepo) trade-offs. While some express a preference for the composability of multirepos and the pitfalls of git submodules, others highlight the developer friction of managing multiple repositories, especially for coordinated changes. A practical concern was raised about dependency management in the author's "no workspaces" approach, which could lead to drift and "it works on my machine" issues without formal monorepo tooling. Ultimately, many commenters suggest that the monorepo is a valid choice for small teams, but it requires discipline and will eventually face challenges related to deployment complexity and organizational structure as the company grows.

## [Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming](https://codecrafters.io/blog/programming-project-ideas)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46439027

> **Article:** The article from CodeCrafters, titled "Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming," proposes a list of 100 projects designed to help developers move beyond "glue code" and gain a deeper appreciation for programming. The projects are framed as "building from scratch" exercises, covering a wide range of topics from implementing fundamental algorithms (like a B-Tree) and tools (like a text editor or a JSON parser) to building complex systems (like a BitTorrent client, a Redis clone, or a Git client). The underlying message is that by recreating existing technologies, programmers can better understand how they work and reconnect with the craft of software engineering.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical and skeptical of the article. The dominant theme is the suspicion that the list was AI-generated. Commenters point to the inconsistent difficulty levels of the projects (e.g., placing `malloc` next to a streaming protocol) and a generic, superficial tone as evidence. This skepticism is amplified by the fact that the post is from CodeCrafters, a company that runs "build-your-own-x" style coding challenges, leading to accusations of astroturfing or low-effort marketing.

Despite the criticism of the source, many commenters engaged positively with the *idea* behind the projects. Several users shared their own rewarding experiences building a BitTorrent client, a P2P client, or an FPGA-based game, reinforcing the article's core theme. A recurring piece of advice was to start with smaller, well-defined projects to get the satisfaction of completing a full arc.

A notable counterpoint was a comment defending the "build from scratch" philosophy, regardless of the article's origin. This user compared the practice to Japanese "Shugyo" (austere training), arguing that the friction of manual implementation builds a deep mental model that is invaluable, especially as an antidote to AI dependency. Finally, some users offered alternative resources they considered superior, such as Austin Henley's "Challenging programming projects" and "The Architecture of Open Source Applications" book series.

## [Honey's Dieselgate: Detecting and tricking testers](https://vptdigital.com/blog/honey-detecting-testers/)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46438522

> **Article:** The article by Ben Edelman, titled "Honey's Dieselgate," accuses the popular browser extension Honey of deceptive practices similar to the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The core allegation is that Honey operates a "selective stand down" algorithm. While Honey claims to "stand down" (not claim a commission) if it detects an existing affiliate link on a purchase, the article claims it deliberately avoids standing down when it detects it is being tested by an affiliate marketer. This allows Honey to appear compliant during audits while still "cookie stuffing" and stealing commissions from other affiliates on real user purchases. The article also alleges Honey strongarms merchants into removing valid discount codes from the web by threatening to surface them to its users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of Honey's business practices, with many commenters expressing disappointment but not surprise. A central theme is the prevalence of "cookie stuffing" and affiliate marketing fraud, with some users noting this is an old tactic. There is a debate over the "Dieselgate" analogy; some argue it's hyperbolic given the low stakes of affiliate commissions compared to environmental damage, while others defend it as an effective way to explain the technical deception.

Several users shared personal anecdotes, including a former affiliate marketer who lost revenue to Honey and a telco employee who found their brand was strong enough to make affiliates redundant. The ethics of the engineers building these systems were questioned, with one commenter suggesting that economic pressures and a lack of job security can lead engineers to compromise their morals. There was also a meta-discussion about the original article's website and a broken archive link, with the site's owner (Ben Edelman) himself chiming in to ask for feedback.

> **Article:** The article by Daniel Sternberg (author of curl) announces the removal of `strcpy` from the curl codebase. He explains that `strcpy` is a "honeypot" for AI-powered vulnerability scanners, which frequently generate false-positive reports claiming a buffer overflow exists when `strcpy` is used. To prevent this, the team has introduced a custom replacement function, `curlx_strcopy`, which takes both the destination buffer and its size as arguments. This function performs a size check before copying and uses `DEBUGASSERT` to catch potential overflows during development. The goal is to eliminate a common trigger for "AI slop" reports and enforce safer copying practices.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the practicality of the solution, the broader issue of AI-generated vulnerability reports, and the state of memory safety in C.

A significant portion of the conversation critiques the new `curlx_strcopy` function. Commenters note that its void return type and reliance on `DEBUGASSERT` (which is removed in release builds) is a questionable design. They argue that it silently fails by writing an empty string to the destination when a copy is impossible, rather than signaling an error, which they find error-prone.

The community is highly critical of the "AI slop" phenomenon, where automated tools generate convoluted, incorrect vulnerability reports. However, a distinction is made between these low-quality reports and a "new breed" of high-quality AI analyzers that have reportedly helped fix hundreds of real bugs in curl.

Finally, the discussion broadens to the inherent dangers of C string functions and the path to memory safety. While some see this change as a small step, others argue that true safety requires more fundamental changes, such as using length-prefixed string libraries or replacing manual memory management entirely with safer languages like Rust.

## [The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network](https://subseacables.blogspot.com/2025/12/the-british-empires-resilient-subsea.html)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46432999

> **Article:** The article, "The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network," details the vast and strategically vital telegraph network that connected the British Empire. Often called the "All Red Line" because the cables ran predominantly through British territory, this system of undersea cables formed the world's first global communication system. The article highlights the engineering and logistical achievements required to lay and maintain these cables, which were crucial for imperial administration, military command, and commerce, effectively shrinking communication times from weeks (by ship) to minutes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing fascination and awe at the scale and ingenuity of the 19th-century telegraph network. The conversation is characterized by a high degree of shared knowledge and mutual recommendation of related resources.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Personal Connections and Historical Sightseeing:** Many commenters shared personal anecdotes of visiting historical sites related to the telegraph network. Users mentioned visiting the cable hut in Porthcurno, the original cable landing site on Valentia Island in Ireland, and learning that towns like Alice Springs, Australia, and Denver, USA, were founded as key repeater stations on these long-distance lines.

*   **Book and Article Recommendations:** A strong consensus emerged around two key resources for further reading: Tom Standage's book *The Victorian Internet* and Neal Stephenson's seminal 1996 *Wired* magazine article, "Mother Earth, Mother Board." Both are praised for exploring not just the technology but also the profound social, cultural, and cryptographic impact of the telegraph, drawing parallels to the modern internet.

*   **Technical and Historical Details:** Users delved into specific technical aspects, such as the use of Gutta-Percha (an early thermoplastic) for cable insulation and the high latency caused by manual repeater stations, with one user noting a 45-minute delay for a London-Mumbai message. The discussion also touched on the environmental impact, with a mention of trees being felled for rubber.

*   **The "Original Internet":** Several participants framed the telegraph network as a direct precursor to the modern internet, noting that it pioneered concepts like instant global communication, privacy concerns, and encryption long before the digital age.

## [LLVM AI tool policy: human in the loop](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-ai-tool-policy-human-in-the-loop/89159)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46440833

> **Article:** The article is a "Request for Comments" (RFC) on the LLVM project's discourse forum, proposing a formal policy for the use of AI tools (like LLMs) in code contributions. The core principle is "human in the loop," meaning contributors are fully responsible for any code they submit, regardless of whether it was generated by an AI. The policy explicitly forbids submitting code that the contributor does not understand and cannot explain. It also bans the use of automated review tools that publish comments without human review, aiming to prevent spamming maintainers and to preserve the value of human-to-human code review and knowledge sharing. The goal is to manage the anticipated surge in low-quality, AI-generated contributions ("slop") and maintain the project's standards.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was overwhelmingly supportive of the policy, with many commenters expressing that such a rule should be common sense. A central theme was the widespread frustration among experienced developers and maintainers with reviewing "slop"—code submitted by colleagues who don't understand it and use the excuse "an LLM did it." Several commenters shared personal anecdotes of this happening at their workplaces, viewing it as an unacceptable abdication of professional responsibility. The consensus was that the developer must "stand behind their work," and AI is just a tool, not a scapegoat.

A point of minor debate was the ban on automated review tools. While some saw it as a way to ensure human knowledge transfer and prevent "plausibility engine" errors, others noted that these tools can be useful if properly supervised by a human. The conversation also touched on the broader issue of "vibe coders" and the growing imbalance between the ease of generating code and the difficulty of finding enough skilled reviewers. Overall, the community saw the policy as a necessary and welcome step to preserve code quality and contributor accountability in the age of AI.

## [Zpdf: PDF text extraction in Zig](https://github.com/Lulzx/zpdf)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46437288

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for `zpdf`, a new PDF text extraction library written in the Zig programming language. The author claims it is significantly faster than MuPDF, achieving peak throughput of ~41,000 pages per second. The performance is attributed to several technical choices: memory-mapped I/O, zero-copy parsing, SIMD-accelerated string search, parallel page extraction using Zig's thread pool, and streaming output. The library is approximately 5,000 lines of code, has no external dependencies, and compiles in under two seconds. It handles various PDF features including XRef streams, incremental updates, common compression filters, and complex font encodings like CID fonts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a polarized reaction, split between technical appreciation and skepticism regarding the project's origin and quality.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the author's use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create the project. A critic pointed out that the first commit, README, and commit messages appear to be "vibe coded" or AI-generated, expressing disdain for such projects reaching the front page. However, another user defended this approach as a valid "hacker ethos," arguing that the utility of the tool is more important than how it was created. The author confirmed they added Python bindings shortly after the post, which some users requested.

Technical feedback was mixed. While some praised the performance claims and Zig's capabilities for high-speed systems programming, others raised serious concerns about quality and correctness. A user reported that the tool segfaulted on every PDF they tested. Another provided a direct comparison, noting that while `zpdf` is faster, its output was "messier" and it failed to handle Unicode correctly, suggesting the speed boost might come from cutting corners on accuracy. A key point of contention was the claim of "memory safety," which a user challenged, highlighting that Zig offers manual memory management and does not have a garbage collector, making it closer to C in terms of safety.

Finally, there were practical questions about the library's scope. One user noted that for many applications, the robustness and accuracy of parsing obscure PDF features are more critical than raw speed, and they were happy to see the project's MIT license, which is more permissive than MuPDF's. The author responded to feedback by adding a feature comparison table to the README.
