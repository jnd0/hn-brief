# Hacker News Summary - 2025-12-31

## [Netflix Open Content](https://opencontent.netflix.com/)
**Score:** 631 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46431560

> **Article:** The article links to the Netflix Open Content portal, a site providing free access to technical test footage and media assets. The content, which includes clips like "Squid Game" and "Tears of Steel," is intended for developers and engineers to test media pipelines, codecs, and other video processing technologies. The last update to the repository appears to have been in 2020.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the project's current status, the quality of the website itself, and the broader context of open content in the streaming industry.

A primary theme is the project's apparent dormancy. Users quickly noted that the last update was in 2020, with some suggesting the project was a low-effort or abandoned "pet project" that lacked funding and thoroughness. This perception is reinforced by criticisms of the website's design and technical shortcomings, most notably the use of plain HTTP links instead of HTTPS, which several commenters pointed out as a significant security oversight in the modern web.

Another major topic was the motivation behind Netflix's initiative. The consensus is that this is not a purely altruistic gesture but a strategic one. By providing high-quality test content, Netflix encourages the development of better video codecs and open-source tools, which in turn helps them reduce their own bandwidth costs. This aligns the project with the Academy Software Foundation's (ASWF) Digital Production Example Library (DPEL), which hosts more recent content for the industry.

Finally, the discussion broadened into a critique of the streaming industry's lack of innovation compared to physical media. One commenter lamented that streaming has regressed, losing valuable features like director's commentaries and behind-the-scenes content that were common on DVDs, and has simply recreated a stagnant cable TV model online.

## [A faster heart for F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/2025/12/30/a-faster-heart-for-f-droid.html)
**Score:** 408 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46436409

> **Article:** The article "A faster heart for F-Droid" announces a major hardware upgrade for the F-Droid build servers. The previous server was 12-year-old hardware that had been running for five years, which was causing significant speed and maintenance issues. The new hardware is intended to improve build times and reduce the operational burden on the volunteer team. The post also emphasizes the unique hosting arrangement: the server is not in a commercial data center but is physically held by a trusted, long-time contributor, allowing the team to maintain full control and knowledge of its physical location and access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was overwhelmingly critical of the infrastructure details revealed in the article. The central point of contention was the hosting arrangement. Several commenters expressed alarm that a project of F-Droid's stature is hosted on a single server in an individual's home (or "bedroom"), viewing it as amateurish, risky, and a single point of failure. This was contrasted with the expectation that it would be on standard commercial cloud or colocation hardware, which would allow for easier upgrades and redundancy.

A related theme was the project's transparency and management. Many questioned why, with a recent $400,000 grant, the team didn't opt for a more professional setup. Commenters pointed out the risk of a single person holding physical control of the server, which could become a sticking point in any future disagreements.

However, there was a minority viewpoint defending the F-Droid team. Some argued that this is the reality of many volunteer-run open-source projects and that such "basement" servers are a vital part of the internet's backbone. Others suggested that the focus should be on the accomplishment of doing so much with limited hardware, rather than criticizing the setup. A few commenters also clarified that the server is for *building* apps, not just hosting the repository, which makes the hardware requirements more significant.

## [Nicolas Guillou, French ICC judge sanctioned by the US and “debanked”](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/11/19/nicolas-guillou-french-icc-judge-sanctioned-by-the-us-you-are-effectively-blacklisted-by-much-of-the-world-s-banking-system_6747628_4.html)
**Score:** 391 | **Comments:** 398 | **ID:** 46432057

> **Article:** The article from Le Monde reports that Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC), has been sanctioned by the United States. This action has effectively "debanked" him, cutting him off from much of the global banking system due to the risk of secondary sanctions for any institution that does business with him. The US sanctions are linked to the ICC's investigations into Israeli actions in Gaza. The article highlights the severe personal and professional consequences for Guillou and frames the sanctions as a significant escalation in the conflict between the US (and its ally Israel) and international legal institutions. Guillou has called on European authorities to create a mechanism to protect ICC personnel from the impact of such US sanctions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the US sanctions, viewing them as an abuse of power and a threat to the international rule of law. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Criticism of US Hypocrisy and Overreach:** A dominant theme is the condemnation of the US for using a human rights sanctions framework against judges of a court designed to prosecute human rights violations. Commenters see this as cynical, hypocritical, and a move that makes the US "look like gangsters," ultimately eroding its soft power and credibility. The sanctions are widely interpreted not as a principled stand, but as a political tool to protect an ally and intimidate international bodies.
*   **The Power Imbalance in International Law:** Many users acknowledge that the ICC lacks the power to enforce rulings against superpowers like the US. The discussion posits a "might makes right" reality where the ICC can only effectively prosecute individuals from smaller, less powerful nations. The US sanctions are seen as a raw display of this power, demonstrating that international law is selectively applied.
*   **The Future of the Financial System and Alternatives:** The sanctions' ability to "debank" an individual prompts a sub-discussion on the fragility of the US-dominated financial system. This leads to a debate about potential alternatives, with one commenter suggesting Bitcoin as an escape for those targeted by oppressive governments. However, this idea is immediately shot down by another user as unsustainable and primarily used by criminals, with the argument that widespread tax evasion enabled by such tools would lead to societal collapse.
*   **Political Context and Justifications:** While the majority of the discussion is against the sanctions, a few dissenting voices appear. One user argues that the ICC overstepped its jurisdiction by targeting Israel, a non-member state, and is now facing the consequences. Another commenter brings up the US sanctioning a Brazilian Supreme Court Justice, reinforcing the view that this is a pattern of bullying and political interference, not a consistent application of legal principles.
*   **Broader Authoritarian Context:** The discussion is heavily colored by the perception of the US government itself having authoritarian tendencies. One commenter lists actions by the US administration (controlling the judiciary, threatening journalists, etc.) to argue that the country is no longer a true democracy, and the sanctions against the ICC judge are just another symptom of this decay.

## [Non-Zero-Sum Games](https://nonzerosum.games/)
**Score:** 374 | **Comments:** 178 | **ID:** 46432311

> **Article:** The linked website, "Non-Zero-Sum Games," is a blog that uses the lens of game theory to explore concepts in psychology, sociology, and philosophy. The articles aim to reframe common problems by highlighting how cooperative, non-zero-sum strategies can lead to better outcomes than purely competitive ones. The site is noted for its distinctive, whimsical visual design, featuring custom illustrations, animations, and unique typography to explain complex ideas.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was split between a debate on the site's design and a deeper philosophical debate on the core concepts presented, particularly cooperation versus competition.

A significant portion of the comments focused on the website's aesthetic. Many users praised its unique and "pretty" design as a welcome change from generic web layouts. However, an equal or greater number found the design actively detrimental to the reading experience, criticizing the typography (likened to Comic Sans), distracting animations, and poor color contrast that made the text difficult to read.

The philosophical discussion centered on the viability of cooperation. One commenter argued that "cheating" is an objectively superior strategy in the real world because systems are forgiving and people are often drawn to abusers, suggesting that morality puts individuals at a disadvantage. This sparked a strong rebuttal, with others pointing out that humanity's global success is built on a massive foundation of collaboration, which is an evolutionarily stable strategy. The conversation was nuanced, with one user noting that while cheating can be effective for an individual, widespread defection leads to systemic collapse, and that maintaining the *appearance* of cooperation is crucial for societal stability.

Other topics included:
*   **Capitalism:** A brief but pointed exchange on whether capitalism is a non-zero-sum game of value creation or a zero-sum game of resource extraction with uncounted externalities like pollution.
*   **Meritocracy vs. Effortocracy:** A discussion on a specific article from the site, debating the moral value of rewarding effort versus rewarding actual achievement.
*   **Affirmative Action:** A user critiqued the site's take on affirmative action, arguing it creates a zero-sum game. Others countered that the "meritocracy" it seeks to correct is also a zero-sum system shaped by historical unfairness.
*   **Technical Issues:** Several users noted that the site's RSS feed was broken.

## [OpenAI's cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/12/30/openais-cash-burn-will-be-one-of-the-big-bubble-questions-of-2026)
**Score:** 350 | **Comments:** 489 | **ID:** 46438390

> **Article:** The Economist article, titled "OpenAI's cash burn will be one of the big bubble questions of 2026," posits that OpenAI's immense and growing operational costs, or "cash burn," are unsustainable and represent a major risk. The central question for the near future is whether the company can generate enough revenue to justify its massive spending on compute, talent, and infrastructure. The article frames this situation as a potential bubble, with OpenAI's financial viability being the key test case for the entire AI industry in 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's premise and frames, while also debating the broader economic and strategic landscape of AI.

A primary theme is the critique of the article's language and lack of new information. One user questions the use of terms like "burn" and "incinerate," arguing that the money isn't disappearing but is being spent, with Nvidia and others profiting. This is countered by the common financial expectation of a return on investment, which critics see as absent. Another commenter dismisses the article as adding nothing new to the public conversation.

The conversation then pivots to the fundamental economics and valuation of OpenAI. A striking comparison is made between OpenAI's potential valuation (~$500-800B) and the entire global chocolate market (~$135B), leading to skepticism about whether the company's value can be justified. However, this is challenged by others who distinguish between revenue and market cap and argue that the transformative potential of AI makes it a different class of asset, with one user stating they wouldn't give up ChatGPT for chocolate.

Several users offered counter-narratives to the "runaway spending" idea. One prominent comment suggests that OpenAI may not be training new foundational models as frequently as assumed (since GPT-4o), and that its capital raising could be a strategic move to "weather an AI winter" rather than a sign of desperation. Another user argues that the bubble isn't about the technology itself, but about public expectations for continuously cheap and rapid progress, which a slowdown could shatter.

Finally, the discussion touched on corporate strategy and government intervention. Anthropic's focus on coding was seen as a more direct path to SaaS-like profitability compared to OpenAI's broader approach. The idea of governments providing compute infrastructure was floated, but quickly shot down by a user who argued it would devolve into a political lobbying contest, rewarding the best "pitchers" rather than the most innovative companies.

## [FediMeteo: A €4 FreeBSD VPS Became a Global Weather Service](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/02/26/fedimeteo-how-a-tiny-freebsd-vps-became-a-global-weather-service-for-thousands/)
**Score:** 305 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46436889

> **Article:** The article "FediMeteo: A €4 FreeBSD VPS Became a Global Weather Service" details the creation and scaling of a weather service for the Fediverse (the "fediverse" is a collection of social networking services like Mastodon). The author, draga79, explains how he built the service, named FediMeteo, on an extremely low-cost Virtual Private Server (VPS) from German provider Netcup, costing only €4 per month.

The service works by fetching weather data from Open-Meteo (a free, open-source weather API) and posting localized forecasts to Fediverse users who follow the service's account. The article provides a technical breakdown of the system, which is written in Python and uses FreeBSD for its efficiency and stability. The author highlights the project's surprising success, scaling from a personal project to serving thousands of users globally, and discusses the challenges of managing this growth on a budget, such as implementing caching and optimizing database queries. The piece serves as an inspiration, demonstrating that powerful, scalable services can be built with minimal financial investment by leveraging efficient software and smart architecture.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with enthusiasm to the project, with comments centering on three main themes: the impressive nature of the project, the specific hardware and cost details, and the choice of operating system.

Many commenters expressed admiration for the project, calling it "awesome" and "great inspiration." They praised the author for demonstrating what can be achieved with a small VPS and for the detailed write-up. Several users, including the original poster, engaged in a discussion about the specific €4 VPS deal, with one user providing a direct link to the Netcup offer and others pointing to resources like LowEndBox for finding similar bargains. This sparked a side conversation about other budget-friendly hosting providers like Contabo and OVH.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the choice of FreeBSD. One commenter argued that FreeBSD has less bloat and better latency than typical Linux distributions, using their own experience with a small Vultr VM as evidence. This prompted a counterpoint from another user who championed Alpine Linux as a similarly lightweight and snappy alternative. The conversation also touched on broader themes of minimalist, efficient computing, with one user expressing a desire to build a simple, no-frills web app on FreeBSD, free from the complexities of modern frameworks.

## [A Vulnerability in Libsodium](https://00f.net/2025/12/30/libsodium-vulnerability/)
**Score:** 272 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46435614

> **Article:** The article announces a vulnerability in the widely-used cryptography library Libsodium. The flaw relates to how certain functions handle points on the Curve25519 elliptic curve. Specifically, the library was failing to properly validate that input points belong to the prime-order subgroup, a critical requirement for many cryptographic protocols. The author notes that while Libsodium was originally designed as a high-level API to shield users from such complexities, it has increasingly been used as a low-level toolkit, which exposes users to these kinds of subtle implementation details. The article serves as a security advisory and a reflection on the challenges of designing cryptographic APIs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the technical nature of the bug, its widespread impact, and the philosophy of cryptographic library design. A key contributor, CiPHPerCoder, reported that the vulnerability also affected the PHP `sodium_compat` library and initiated a broad audit of other Ed25519 implementations to check for similar flaws.

Commenters analyzed the technical implications, noting that this is a prime example of how subtle validation errors in low-level primitives can have a large "blast radius." However, one user (loup-vaillant) offered a nuanced counterpoint, explaining that the original design of X25519 and Ed25519 was intended to make such checks unnecessary. They argued that for many use cases, protocols can be designed to safely handle points outside the prime-order subgroup, and that Ristretto is a solution for situations where this is not possible.

Finally, there was a philosophical discussion about the library's evolution. Users highlighted the tension between the author's original vision of a simple, high-level API and the community's real-world need for low-level primitives. This led to a broader reflection on how open-source maintainers must adapt to user needs, even if they diverge from the initial project goals, with many users expressing gratitude for the library and its maintainer, Frank Denis.

## [Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts](https://hsu.cy/2025/12/times-new-american/)
**Score:** 258 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46432862

> **Article:** The article "Times New American: A Tale of Two Fonts" examines the recent decision by the U.S. State Department to revert its official documents from Calibri (15pt) back to Times New Roman (14pt). The author argues that while the previous Calibri setting was visually unappealing ("truly awful"), the return to Times New Roman is a regression. The piece provides a history of the fonts, noting that Times New Roman was designed for newspaper columns to save space, while Calibri was designed by Microsoft specifically for on-screen readability. The article concludes that the decision is likely driven more by political symbolism—framing Calibri as a "DEI" font—rather than by typographic merit, and that the administration missed an opportunity to choose a truly superior font for government communication.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely mirrors the article's sentiment, viewing the font change as a politically motivated regression rather than a functional upgrade. The conversation centers on three main themes:

1.  **The Politics of the Decision:** Many commenters interpret the switch as a reaction against perceived "wokeness," noting that Calibri was targeted for its association with DEI initiatives. There is a consensus that the decision was driven by culture war optics rather than design or accessibility standards. Several users suggest that if the government wanted a unique identity, they should have commissioned a custom font rather than reverting to a Microsoft default.

2.  **Typographic and Accessibility Merits:** A technical debate ensued regarding the legibility of serif vs. sans-serif fonts. Commenters noted that while serif fonts (like Times) are traditionally preferred for long-form print reading, sans-serif fonts (like Calibri) are often better for digital screens. The developer of Calibri, Luc(as) de Groot, appeared in the comments to defend his font's design for modern screens and accessibility. Conversely, others argued that Calibri looked amateurish ("like a leasing office") and that Times New Roman, while dated, signals gravitas.

3.  **Better Alternatives:** Several users argued that the binary choice between Calibri and Times New Roman is a "false dichotomy." They proposed better alternatives, including Public Sans (an open-source font created by the US government), Century Schoolbook (used in the Warren Commission report), or other professional typefaces like Garamond or Palatino. There was also a recurring suggestion to use monospaced "teletype" fonts for cables to maintain historical aesthetic consistency.

## [Honey's Dieselgate: Detecting and tricking testers](https://vptdigital.com/blog/honey-detecting-testers/)
**Score:** 230 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46438522

> **Article:** The article, authored by Ben Edelman, details how the Honey browser extension engages in deceptive affiliate marketing practices, dubbing it "Honey's Dieselgate." The core allegation is that Honey uses a "selective stand down" algorithm. While it claims to "stand down" (not claim a commission) if it detects an existing affiliate link, it is programmed to ignore this rule and claim the commission anyway if it determines the user is not an affiliate marketer testing for compliance. This is achieved by checking for cookies and browser history associated with affiliate marketing dashboards. The article also accuses Honey of scraping discount codes from user checkouts (including private or employee-only codes) and then using this data to pressure merchants into removing those codes, effectively holding their own data hostage.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is heavily critical of Honey's business practices, with several key themes emerging. Many commenters were shocked by the "selective stand down" feature, viewing it as a deliberate and sophisticated system for commission theft and cookie stuffing. The comparison to Volkswagen's Dieselgate scandal sparked a debate: while some felt it was an apt analogy for a system designed to deceive compliance testers, others argued it trivialized the severity of environmental crimes compared to affiliate marketing disputes.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the engineers involved, with many expressing disbelief that professionals would design such a system without an "are we the baddies?" moment. This led to broader discussions about corporate pressure and the ethics of working in ad-tech. Several users shared personal anecdotes about the inherent unreliability of affiliate marketing, suggesting that brands often overpay for customers they would have acquired anyway. The thread also touched on tangential but related issues, such as the problem of honey adulteration (a literal interpretation of the title), the failure of Chrome's store approval process to catch such behavior, and comparisons to other corporate deception scandals like Uber's "Greyball" program.

## [Public Sans – A strong, neutral typeface](https://public-sans.digital.gov/)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46433579

> **Article:** The article links to the official page for "Public Sans," a free, open-source typeface developed by the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS). It is described as a "strong, neutral" sans-serif font designed for text or display, intended for use on U.S. government websites and applications. The font is based on the popular open-source font "Inter" and is optimized for legibility and clarity in user interfaces and long-form text.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Public Sans was largely a mix of historical context, personal font preferences, and comparisons to other popular typefaces. A key point of clarification was that the project predates the recent Microsoft Calibri replacement controversy, originating instead from U.S. government digital services initiatives.

The conversation quickly pivoted to a debate on font legibility, sparked by a user's complaint that Public Sans, like many sans-serifs, makes it difficult to distinguish between a lowercase 'l', an uppercase 'I', and the number '1'. This led to a popular recommendation for IBM Plex Sans, which is specifically designed to solve this problem. Other highly-regarded alternatives were also suggested, including Inter (for UI), Atkinson Hyperlegible (for accessibility), and Plus Jakarta Sans.

Other notable points included:
*   Aesthetics: One user found the font "pleasant," while another felt it "neuters" the character of its inspiration, Franklin Gothic.
*   Design Comparison: A designer noted that Public Sans and Roboto are functionally very similar, making the choice between them largely preferential.
*   Government Context: The discussion touched on the current state of U.S. government digital services, with some users expressing skepticism about the project's ongoing support while others noted the font's availability on GitHub ensures its longevity.

## [NYC Mayoral Inauguration bans Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero alongside explosives](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/12/30/nyc-mayoral-inauguration-bans-raspberry-pi-and-flipper-zero-alongside-explosives/)
**Score:** 217 | **Comments:** 179 | **ID:** 46438828

> **Article:** An article on the Adafruit blog reports that the NYC Mayoral Inauguration security protocols have banned Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero devices, placing them in the same prohibited category as explosives. The article highlights the perceived absurdity of equating hobbyist electronics with dangerous items, framing it as an example of security theater and a lack of understanding of the technology by event organizers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was largely critical of the ban, viewing it as security theater and a sign of the devices' "big time" status. Commenters questioned the logic and enforcement of such a rule, noting that "Raspberry Pi" is likely being used as a catch-all term for any small circuit board computer. Several users pointed out the inconsistency of banning these devices while allowing more capable devices like laptops and cell phones, with some suggesting this is a legal strategy to bypass Second Amendment challenges by reclassifying items as "not weapons."

Personal anecdotes from users highlighted the anxiety of traveling with development boards, though one user noted that strange-looking electronics often attract less scrutiny than expected. The ban was also interpreted by some as a "petty" attempt by new security personnel to prove their worth by expanding prohibited lists. A secondary thread of discussion criticized the article's host, Adafruit, for using Cloudflare, which blocks Tor users and presents misleading security warnings to others, thereby undermining the "hacker-friendly" ethos of the piece.

## [No strcpy either](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/12/29/no-strcpy-either/)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46433029

> **Article:** The article, by curl maintainer Daniel Sternberg (bagder), announces the removal of all `strcpy` and `strcat` calls from the curl codebase. This is part of a broader, multi-year effort to eliminate "unsafe" C string functions. The replacement is a custom internal function, `curlx_strcopy`, which takes both the destination buffer and its size. It includes an internal check to ensure the source string (including its null terminator) will fit. If it doesn't fit, the function writes an empty string to the destination and triggers a `DEBUGASSERT`. The author notes that this change, along with others, is expected to reduce the volume of "AI slop" vulnerability reports, as `strcpy` is a common trigger for them.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is multifaceted, focusing on the technical implementation, the context of AI-generated bug reports, and the broader challenges of C string handling.

Several commenters critique the design of the new `curlx_strcopy` function. The main points of contention are its `void` return type and its behavior on failure (truncating the destination to an empty string). Critics argue that this is not a robust error-handling pattern and that an explicit error code would be more useful, as it forces the caller to handle the failure case rather than just checking an assertion.

A significant portion of the discussion revolves around the article's mention of "AI slop" vulnerability reports. Users express frustration with the low quality of AI-generated security reports, which often invent complex but flawed "proofs" of vulnerabilities. However, it's also pointed out that the author has acknowledged that a "new breed" of more sophisticated AI-powered analyzers has been useful, having led to the discovery of hundreds of real bugs. This creates a nuanced view where low-effort AI spam is condemned, but more advanced AI analysis is seen as beneficial.

Finally, the conversation touches on the fundamental difficulties of string manipulation in C. Commenters discuss the specific, historical use cases for functions like `strncpy` (for fixed-width, null-padded fields) and express a general desire for better string handling libraries that track buffer size, such as "bstring."

## [Everything as code: How we manage our company in one monorepo](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/everything-as-code-monorepo)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46437381

> **Article:** The article "Everything as code" details the author's company practice of managing their entire business within a single monorepo. This includes not only application code (frontend and backend) but also business operations like marketing content, design assets, and business planning documents. The author highlights several benefits: simplified context management for AI coding tools like Claude, atomic commits that span the entire stack, elimination of synchronization issues between different services, and a unified, searchable knowledge base for the entire company. They use a simple folder structure to separate concerns (e.g., `/marketing`, `/app`, `/ops`) and manually manage dependencies, forgoing complex monorepo tooling in favor of simplicity and velocity, especially for a small team.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide on the monorepo approach, with a significant portion of the debate centering on scale, tooling, and the influence of AI.

A major theme is the newfound appeal of monorepos for AI-assisted development. Several commenters, including the top-voted one, state that tools like Claude Code have made them reconsider their stance, as providing a single, unified context for the AI is a powerful advantage. This is seen as a primary driver for the "everything as code" philosophy, extending to non-technical work like marketing.

However, this optimism is tempered by concerns about long-term viability. Critics argue that while monorepos are excellent for velocity in a small startup, they introduce significant challenges as a company scales. Key technical objections include the difficulty of managing complex, lock-step deployments (especially for database schema changes that require backward compatibility), the risk of "cross-contamination" where one team's changes break another's, and the organizational problem of a single team holding back progress for the entire organization. A specific critique was that the author's claim of "one change, everywhere" is naive because it's physically impossible to deploy application code and database migrations simultaneously without downtime or compatibility planning.

The discussion also revisited the classic monorepo vs. multirepo debate. Proponents of multirepos (or using git submodules) value composability and the ability to version and deploy services independently, avoiding the "scale hell" of a single repository. Conversely, multirepo advocates noted the significant overhead of coordinating changes across multiple repositories, which monorepos simplify.

Finally, there was some skepticism about the author's specific implementation, with commenters questioning the lack of formal monorepo tooling for managing shared dependencies and types, which could lead to "it works on my machine" issues. A cynical viewpoint dismissed the entire article as a naive perspective from a small, unproven company where any engineering approach works because the stakes are low.

## [Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming](https://codecrafters.io/blog/programming-project-ideas)
**Score:** 198 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46439027

> **Article:** The article from CodeCrafters, titled "Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming," proposes a list of 100 projects designed to help developers deepen their understanding and appreciation of programming. The projects range from creating a text editor, a ray tracer, or a BitTorrent client to more complex tasks like building a database, an operating system kernel, or a distributed key-value store. The central theme is the "build from scratch" methodology, arguing that the process of creating something fundamental reveals the inner workings of the tools developers use daily and fosters a deeper connection to the craft of programming.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical and skeptical of the article. The dominant theme is the suspicion that the list was AI-generated, a point raised by multiple users who noted the inconsistent difficulty levels and generic descriptions. This led to accusations of "astroturfing" and low-quality "slop," with commenters pointing out that the post is essentially marketing for the CodeCrafters platform.

In contrast to the OP, users championed alternative resources like Austin Henley's "Challenging programming projects" and "The Architecture of Open Source Applications" book series, praising them for being more concise, practical, and thoughtfully curated. The BitTorrent client was highlighted as a particularly rewarding project.

A more philosophical counterpoint emerged, arguing that the value of such "Shugyo" (austere training) lies in the struggle and friction of building things manually, which builds mental models that AI cannot replicate. However, the conversation also included meta-commentary, with some users critiquing the commenters themselves for perceived affectations or bot-like behavior. Ultimately, while the community agrees on the value of building projects from scratch, they found the OP's execution to be uninspired and commercially driven.

**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46432999

> **Article:** The article, "The British empire's resilient subsea telegraph network," details the vast subsea telegraph cable network that connected the British Empire. This network, known as the "All Red Line" due to the red color of British territories on maps, was a marvel of 19th and early 20th-century engineering. It enabled rapid communication across the globe, fundamentally shrinking the world for governance, trade, and military command. The article likely discusses the technical challenges, the materials used (like Gutta Percha for insulation), and the strategic importance of this infrastructure in maintaining imperial control and connectivity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users sharing personal anecdotes, recommending further reading, and reflecting on the historical significance of the telegraph network. The conversation can be broken down into a few key themes:

*   **Personal Connections and Anecdotes:** Many commenters shared stories of visiting historical telegraph sites, such as the cable hut in Porthcurno, UK, the first transatlantic cable landing point in Valentia Island, Ireland, and the repeater station in Alice Springs, Australia. These stories highlight the physical legacy of the network and its surprising presence in remote locations.

*   **Recommended Reading:** A strong consensus emerged around two key resources for anyone interested in the topic:
    *   **"The Victorian Internet" by Tom Standage:** Praised for explaining how the telegraph network pioneered concepts we associate with the modern internet, such as privacy, encryption, and the separation of information from its physical medium.
    *   **"Mother Earth, Mother Board" by Neal Stephenson:** A classic Wired magazine article (and precursor to his book *Cryptonomicon*) that explores the engineering and history of undersea cables.

*   **Technical and Historical Context:** Users added interesting details, such as the use of Gutta Percha as an early thermoplastic for cable insulation (and the resulting ecological damage), the high latency due to manual repeater stations (messages could take 45 minutes to cross from London to Mumbai), and the fact that many towns (like Alice Springs and Denver) were founded as support stations for the telegraph network.

*   **The "Original Internet":** Several participants drew a direct parallel between the telegraph network and the modern internet, noting that it was the first system to enable near-instantaneous global communication and fostered a new "online" culture (with its own etiquette, scams, and romances) long before digital computers.

## [LLVM AI tool policy: human in the loop](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-ai-tool-policy-human-in-the-loop/89159)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46440833

> **Article:** The article is a "Request for Comments" (RFC) on the LLVM project's discourse forum, proposing a new policy for the use of AI tools (like LLMs) in code contributions. The core principle is "human in the loop," meaning contributors are fully responsible for any code they submit, regardless of whether it was generated by an AI. The policy explicitly forbids submitting code that the contributor does not understand and cannot explain. It also bans the use of automated, non-human-reviewed bots to generate code review comments. The goal is to maintain code quality, ensure accountability, and prevent an influx of low-quality, unreviewable "slop" contributions as AI coding tools become more prevalent.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was overwhelmingly supportive of the policy, with commenters expressing that such a policy should be common sense. A central theme was the shared frustration with colleagues who submit AI-generated code without understanding it, using phrases like "I don't know, an LLM did it" as a defense. Commenters emphasized that the individual submitting the code is ultimately responsible for it and must be able to stand behind their work.

While the overall sentiment was positive, there was some debate on specific points. One commenter questioned the ban on automated review bots, arguing they can be useful, but others countered that human review is essential for knowledge sharing and that LLMs are "plausibility engines," not definitive arbiters of quality. Another minor critique was about the tone of the proposed template response to violators, suggesting it could be more welcoming to new contributors. The general mood was one of relief that a major open-source project is proactively addressing the potential for a flood of low-quality AI-generated contributions.

## [Zpdf: PDF text extraction in Zig](https://github.com/Lulzx/zpdf)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46437288

> **Article:** The article introduces `zpdf`, a new PDF text extraction library written in the Zig programming language. The author claims it achieves significantly higher performance than MuPDF (up to ~41K pages/sec) by utilizing memory-mapped I/O, SIMD-accelerated string search, parallel page extraction, and zero-copy parsing. The library is approximately 5,000 lines of code, has no external dependencies, and compiles in under two seconds. It supports common PDF features including various compression filters, CID fonts, and incremental updates. The repository also recently added Python bindings to facilitate usage in other ecosystems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: the technical implementation, the validity of the project given its development method, and its practical utility.

A significant portion of the debate focused on the project's origin. Several users noted that the project was created very recently and suspected it was "vibe coded" (heavily assisted or generated by LLMs), pointing to LLM-style commit messages and READMEs. While some argued that the "hacker ethos" values results over methods, others reported that the library failed on basic test cases, segfaulting on simple PDFs and producing messy, incorrect output, suggesting a lack of rigorous testing.

Technically, users questioned the source of the speed gains. One commenter noted that the library appeared to lack proper Unicode handling compared to MuPDF, implying that the speed boost might come from ignoring complex text encoding standards. There was also confusion regarding the implementation of parallel processing and the specific role of SIMD.

Finally, regarding utility, users emphasized that PDF extraction requires high accuracy and support for obscure features, not just raw speed. The comparison to MuPDF—a mature, comprehensive library—was viewed as challenging. However, the permissive MIT license was highlighted as a major advantage over MuPDF's AGPL license for commercial use.

## [Approachable Swift Concurrency](https://fuckingapproachableswiftconcurrency.com/en/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46432916

> **Article:** The article "Approachable Swift Concurrency" is a guide to Swift's modern concurrency features, including `async/await`, actors, and structured concurrency. It aims to demystify these concepts with clear explanations and code examples, positioning itself as a resource for developers navigating the complexities introduced in recent Swift versions. The title follows a popular online convention of using profanity for emphasis in technical guides.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the trade-offs of Swift's modern concurrency model. While many appreciate the article's clarity, the conversation quickly diverges into fundamental disagreements about the nature of concurrency and the specific implementation in Swift.

A central debate emerged between users `jen20` and `seanalltogether` over the default behavior of `async/await`. `seanalltogether` described the ideal model as single-threaded suspension, whereas `jen20` countered that modern Swift, like other languages, uses a work-stealing executor that moves tasks between threads by default, making multi-threading the common case.

Several users expressed frustration with the complexity and perceived "shoehorned" nature of Swift's concurrency features. `isodev` criticized the custom terminology ("actor," "task"), keyword overload, and the fact that deadlocks are still possible, while `jgavries` and `travisgriggs` confessed a preference for older, more explicit models like Combine/GCD, arguing that `async/await`'s "sequential-looking" syntax is an illusion that complicates reasoning about program flow. In contrast, `scottmf` and `mojuba` defended the model, praising Swift's clean syntax and the performance benefits of leveraging multiple CPU cores.

Beyond Swift-specific issues, the discussion offered broader wisdom on concurrency. `MORPHOICES` shared a practical mental framework for avoiding bugs by focusing on execution shape and data ownership first, a sentiment echoed by `jesuslop`'s advocacy for share-nothing architectures. The thread also included a direct comparison of Swift and Go, where `scottmf` argued that Swift's syntax is significantly cleaner for common tasks, a point contested by others who demonstrated more concise Go examples.

## [Professional software developers don't vibe, they control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14012)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 197 | **ID:** 46437391

> **Article:** The paper "Professional software developers don't vibe, they control" investigates how professional developers use "agentic" AI tools (integrated into IDEs/terminals, not just web chat). Based on 13 field observations and 99 survey respondents in late 2025, the authors argue that professional development with AI is not "vibe coding" (prompting and hoping for the best). Instead, it is a disciplined practice of control, steering, and verification. Developers spend most of their time reviewing AI-generated code, constraining the agent's behavior, and ensuring correctness through tests and architectural guardrails. The study highlights that the primary skill gap is not prompt engineering, but the ability to manage the agent's output and maintain system integrity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the validity of the study's methodology, the changing nature of the developer's role, and the emotional reaction to the AI hype cycle.

A significant portion of the comments scrutinized the study's sample size (N=13 for observations, N=99 for surveys). While some dismissed it as statistically insignificant, others countered that significance depends on effect size and that the study's value lies in its qualitative insights. Several users noted that the research was conducted in August-September 2025, making it very current but potentially already outdated given the rapid pace of model releases (e.g., missing the latest Codex or Claude versions).

Regarding the paper's thesis, users agreed that the role of a senior developer is shifting from "writing code" to "steering systems." One commenter noted that this shift forces developers to think more deeply about requirements upfront, as the act of writing code no longer imposes that discipline. However, there was a strong counter-current regarding the burden of code review. The observation that most survey respondents used AI for "building apps" while almost none used it for "testing" reinforced fears that AI generates a mountain of unverified code that others are expected to review. One commenter mentioned firing an employee for relying on unchecked AI code.

Finally, the discussion featured a polarized emotional response to the AI transformation of the industry. One user expressed a defiant indifference to the hype, stating they program for fun and would rather flip burgers than "beg a machine" to write code. Others shared this sentiment, viewing the profession's drive toward automation as a race to irrelevance. Conversely, some argued that open source has historically increased the value of software engineering, suggesting that AI tools might follow a similar trajectory.
