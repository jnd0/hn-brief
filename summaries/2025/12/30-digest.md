# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-30

The top story today is a funeral dirge for Google AdWords, written by a South African agency operator who's spent 15 years relying on it for leads. They declare it dead after campaigns now fail despite heavy spending, blaming complexity, cost, and uselessness for local businesses. The HN crowd mostly agrees, citing click fraud, rising costs, and the platform's bloat, though some note Google's stock is hardly dying. The real meat is in the broader autopsy: this isn't just about ads, but the "dead internet" theory. Commenters point to AI-generated sludge clogging search results and younger users discovering services via TikTok instead of Google. Alternatives like Kagi get a nod, but the consensus is grim—the open web is decaying, and small businesses are left with no good options for discovery. It's a microcosm of a broken system where even paying for visibility no longer works.

Over in gaming land, GOG's escape from CD Projekt Red is seen as a win for DRM-free idealism. The original founder is taking it private, insulating it from stock market pressures after Cyberpunk's rocky launch. HN cheers the move, seeing it as protection for game preservation, though some smell desperation—corporate speak about an "encouraging" year often means "we're bleeding money." The discussion quickly turns to feature requests, especially a Linux client, and defenses of true ownership over Steam's convenience. It's a familiar fight: idealism versus ecosystem lock-in.

Tesla's battery dreams are crumbling as a key supplier wrote down a $2.9 billion deal to just $7,386—a 99.999% haircut. This isn't just a hiccup; it's a near-total collapse of the 4680 cell program, which was supposed to enable a $25k car. HN's reaction is a mix of "told you so" and stock-market cynicism, with Tesla's valuation called a "call option on Musk succeeding." The write-down implies Tesla expects to build maybe one more Cybertruck with this supplier, confirming years of manufacturing failures. It's another data point in the narrative of hype over substance.

The theme of control versus freedom runs through several stories. German ISPs are censoring about 295 domains via DNS blocks, mostly copyright targets, in a private industry effort that's easily bypassed with alternative DNS. Meanwhile, a developer's €500/year savings from switching to EU-based services (Proton, Mullvad) sparked a fiery debate. HN split into camps: self-hosting purists who say "do it yourself," pragmatists who call the alternatives inferior, and privacy advocates who want better options. The takeaway? "EU-based" isn't a privacy silver bullet, and convenience still rules.

eSIMs, promised as a revolution, are now a pain point for many. An Ars piece details how swapping devices or carriers became a nightmare of carrier dependency, unlike the simplicity of physical SIMs. HN users are divided: iPhone loyalists praise seamless transfers, while Android tinkerers rage at lost autonomy. It's another win for walled gardens, stripping users of control under the guise of progress.

In AI land, two pieces clash on whether LLMs are killing programming's soul. One argues AI forces "good code" (100% tests, strict types) to make AI tools viable, while the other mourns the loss of joy—turning creation into tedious prompt management. HN is split: some say AI automates drudgery, freeing them for design; others call it a "hollow" betrayal of the craft. A third story notes ManusAI's team joining Meta, met with skepticism over the acquisition's purpose and Meta's track record of botching integrations. The subtext: talent raids are the new normal, but innovation dies in corporate bureaucracy.

On the hardware front, a talk on hacking washing machines revealed vulnerabilities in Bosch and Miele models, including an optical port for diagnostics. HN appreciated the vendors' responsiveness but fretted over IoT's future: will our appliances need subscriptions to spin? It ties into a broader anxiety about "smart" devices that are less reliable than their "dumb" predecessors.

Finally, a few gems: Zig's static allocation tricks for memory safety got a nod for predictability, though it's not for all workloads. A tool for giving AI coding agents "memory" between sessions sparked debate—some called it essential, others a band-aid for flawed tools. And Netflix's barebones "Open Content" page, last updated in 2020, was mocked as a relic of a more open era.

Worth watching: The fallout from HSBC's app blocking users with F-Droid-installed Bitwarden. It's a stark example of banks treating customers as threats, pushing more toward "de-banking" and fueling the push for financial alternatives. If this spreads, expect more friction between locked-down ecosystems and user freedom.
