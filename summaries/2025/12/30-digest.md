Tesla's 4680 battery saga took a nosedive this week as a key supplier wrote down its contract by 99.999%, effectively declaring the "revolutionary" cell dead on arrival. The $2.9 billion deal collapsing to $7,386 isn’t just a financial footnote—it’s a stark symbol of the gap between Elon Musk’s grand promises and manufacturing reality. While Tesla fans cling to the stock’s speculative aura, the fundamentals scream trouble: declining sales, Cybertruck fiascos, and a battery program that’s more vaporware than holy grail. The real question isn’t whether Tesla can deliver a $25k EV, but how long investors will keep treating it like a tech unicorn instead of a struggling automaker.  

This week’s tech disillusionment extends beyond EVs. Google’s once-dominant ad platform is withering under the weight of click fraud, skyrocketing costs, and users fleeing to TikTok. Small businesses are realizing the open web is dying, and with it, the promise of intent-based advertising. Meanwhile, Meta’s AI ad tools are actively sabotaging brands by swapping human-crafted ads for nonsensical AI-generated garbage—because nothing says "innovation" like replacing proven strategies with algorithmic hallucinations. And in a move dripping with irony, Meta acquired Manus AI, a startup widely seen as a thin wrapper around existing models, proving that in today’s AI gold rush, rebranding other people’s work counts as "pioneering."  

The industry’s AI obsession is also reshaping software development itself. One camp argues that LLMs are stripping programming of its joy, reducing deep problem-solving to prompt engineering. The other side insists AI is a force multiplier that automates drudgery, freeing developers for higher-level creativity. But a darker consensus emerges: AI is forcing "good code" not out of craftsmanship, but necessity. To harness AI, you need rigid guardrails—100% test coverage, strict typing, deterministic formatting—turning development into a machine-readable straitjacket. It’s less about artistry and more about feeding the AI beast. And forget designing systems from first principles; the new wisdom is that you can’t architect what you don’t intimately build and debug.  

While tech giants stumble, Europe’s making moves. The EU’s push for a no-fee "digital euro" payment system aims to dethrone Visa, Mastercard, and Silicon Valley’s wallet hegemony. It’s a sovereignty play framed as public infrastructure, but critics smell a surveillance trap—programmable money with state control written all over it. Speaking of control, Germany’s ISP censorship list quietly targets piracy sites, easily bypassed by switching DNS providers yet revealing how private entities enforce copyright under the guise of order. And if you’ve ever raged at eSIM’s carrier lock-in, you’re not alone: swapping physical SIMs was simple, but eSIM’s "convenience" is a masterclass in vendor control, especially when your phone dies and you need an internet connection to… get an internet connection.  

Amid the chaos, a few bright spots flicker. GOG’s escape from CD Projekt’s shadow back to its DRM-free founder is a win for game preservationists, though financial skeptics whisper that "encouraging year" is corpo-speak for "we’re bleeding cash." And for a hit of nostalgia, Feynman’s 950-page Hughes lectures surfaced—a reminder of an era when deep intellectual rigor wasn’t outsourced to chatbots.  

**Worth watching**: The EU’s digital euro gambit. If it gains traction, it could reshape global payments and challenge the US tech-financial stranglehold. But expect pushback—nobody cedes payment rails quietly.
