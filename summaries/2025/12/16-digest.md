# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-16

Good morning. Let's get you caught up on what the tech world is buzzing about today.

The biggest story, by a wide margin, is Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit against a consortium of major TV manufacturers—Samsung, Sony, LG, Hisense, and TCL—for allegedly spying on what their users watch. The suit claims the TVs' Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) technology acts as a "surveillance device," collecting viewing data from all sources, including HDMI inputs, and selling it without consent. The Hacker News community universally agrees that Smart TV data collection is a massive privacy violation, with many users expressing a desire for simple "dumb" TVs. However, the discussion is rife with skepticism about Paxton's motives, pointing to the conspicuous exclusion of Vizio, a US company with a well-known ACR program, as evidence of selective enforcement and political theater. This lawsuit is less a principled stand for privacy and more a "shakedown" that conveniently targets foreign competitors.

This theme of invasive surveillance extends beyond the living room. A new public interest tool, alpr.watch, is helping activists track the deployment of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) by scraping local government meeting minutes. The project is a tactical resource for "Deflock" movements fighting to block mass surveillance infrastructure at the municipal level. In a similar vein, an investigation revealed that the "Urban VPN" browser extension, used by over 8 million people, was harvesting and selling the full transcripts of users' conversations with AI chatbots. The Hacker News discussion on this was a familiar mix of cynical resignation and frustration with platform gatekeepers, particularly Google's Chrome Web Store, which is widely seen as failing to police malicious extensions effectively. The consensus is that if a service is free, you are the product, and the "privacy" branding is a smokescreen.

The conversation around AI is shifting from hype to practical application and philosophical debate. A compelling argument was made that AI coding agents will finally bring formal verification into the mainstream. The idea is that AI can handle the tedious, specialized work of writing proofs in complex languages, making high-assurance software economically feasible for the first time. However, the community was quick to point out the risks, highlighting that LLMs can "gaslight" developers by confidently generating incorrect proofs, and that the real bottleneck remains getting organizations to write good specifications in the first place. This practical skepticism was echoed in the release of `ty`, a new high-performance Python type checker from the team behind `ruff`. While there's excitement for a faster alternative to `mypy`, the community is wary of sacrificing conformance for speed and is already wary of ecosystem fragmentation.

At the same time, a philosophical backlash against the "thin desires" that modern technology optimizes for is resonating strongly. The article argues that frictionless, scalable pursuits like endless scrolling and quick-hit content "eat your life" by offering hollow satisfaction without personal growth, contrasting them with "thick desires" like learning a craft that fundamentally change you. This sentiment is fueling a backlash against Mozilla's new "AI browser" strategy. The community is baffled by the pivot, arguing that Mozilla's only remaining differentiator is trust, and that integrating data-hungry AI features dilutes this core value. This has created an opening for alternatives like Waterfox, which is explicitly marketing itself as a "No AI" browser. The debate is nuanced, with many users distinguishing between potentially acceptable local AI (for translation) and the opaque, cloud-based LLMs that Mozilla seems to be embracing.

The developer tooling world is also in an uproar over GitHub's upcoming pricing changes for Actions. The new model introduces a per-minute "platform charge" that applies even to self-hosted runners, a move the community has overwhelmingly condemned as a "naked cash grab." The logic is that GitHub is taxing users who are already paying for their own hardware and infrastructure, effectively penalizing cost-conscious teams. This has triggered an immediate search for alternatives, with services like Buildkite and a return to self-hosted solutions being discussed. It's a classic case of a platform extracting more value without providing commensurate improvements, alienating a core part of its user base.

Finally, a few other items are worth a quick mention. A study claiming that 40% of fMRI signals don't correspond to actual brain activity has reignited a familiar debate. While the press release was criticized for being sensationalist, the Hacker News discussion served as a powerful reminder of the deep methodological issues in a field that has been over-hyped and, in some cases, commercially exploited. In graphics, a thought-provoking article on "No Graphics API" proposes a radical simplification of modern APIs like Vulkan, arguing they are burdened by legacy. While praised as a brilliant diagnosis, the community noted the significant hardware prerequisites and the reality that most innovation is happening at the engine level, not the API level. And in a "Show HN" that captured the community's creative spirit, a developer proposed fighting aggressive AI scrapers by poisoning their datasets with hidden links to porn. While the idea was met with amusement, the consensus was that more robust solutions like Anubis, which uses proof-of-work challenges, are a better bet.

**Worth Watching:** The battle over AI scraping is escalating from a nuisance to a fundamental architectural problem for the web. Expect to see a rapid evolution of defensive tools, from clever hacks like data poisoning to more sophisticated, standardized methods of access control, as site owners scramble to protect their content and infrastructure from being vacuumed up for free.
