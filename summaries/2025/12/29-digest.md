# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-29

The digital photography pipeline is a masterclass in illusion, as the top story today reveals. That "unprocessed photo" on your camera? It's a lie from the ground up—raw sensor data is a monochrome mosaic of single-color pixels, heavily green-tinted and utterly unrecognizable. Creating a viewable image requires a gauntlet of processing: demosaicing to guess missing colors, gamma correction to compensate for non-linear displays, and dynamic range compression to squeeze reality into a screen. The Hacker News crowd universally praised this peek behind the curtain, but the real fireworks started when they debated what "real" even means anymore. Every photo is an interpretation, they argued—whether automated by a camera or manually by a photographer. The line between "processing" and "faking" is intent, not technique, and modern AI demosaicing has blurred it further.  

This theme of hidden complexity echoes across today's digest. In the AI world, the CEO automation piece sparked fierce pushback. While the idea of replacing overpaid executives with algorithms sounds tempting, HN pointed out the fatal flaws: CEOs aren't just data-crunchers—they're salespeople, negotiators, and crisis managers whose jobs rely on human relationships. Legally, fiduciary duty requires a human face. Meanwhile, the "AI gobbles up chips" story confirms your next PC upgrade will hurt. RAM prices are spiking as AI firms hoard high-bandwidth memory, forcing manufacturers to divert production. The cynical consensus? It's a price-gouging racket, with budget devices already shipping with laughably low specs. One user grimly joked that consumers will just "eat less" to cope.  

The backlash against AI's cultural impact hit hardest in Rich Hickey's sarcastic "Thanks AI" note. The Clojure creator savages the flood of low-quality "slop" generated by AI, calling it a goldmine for critics of software industry malpractice. HN split between those feeling vindicated by his critique and others dismissing it as hypocritical bandwagoning. This skepticism extends to development practices. The "vibe coding" bookshelf project was celebrated as a perfect use case—AI handling the grunt work while humans provide taste and direction. But HN veterans warned this breaks down at scale: AI loses context, spawns redundant abstractions, and buries bugs. The lesson? Treat AI as a junior pair programmer, not an architect.  

Open-source burnout remains a raw nerve. Brice Dutheil's exit from Mockito after a decade highlights how JVM evolution (like JEP 451's security changes) can crush maintainers. HN sympathized but also debated whether mocking itself is a code smell. The corporate cynicism article struck a chord too, with engineers agreeing that viewing companies as profit-driven entities—not benevolent families—is essential for mental survival. But many pushed back on the author's faith in executive goodwill, sharing horror stories of C-suite "children" who need flattery over facts.  

Under the hood, low-level tech had its moment. The Z80-μLM project—a 40KB "conversational AI" for retro hardware—charmed HN with its clever minimalism. Enthusiasts immediately imagined porting it to Game Boys or custom microcomputers. Meanwhile, the "Huge Binaries" piece dissected the pain of 25GB executables, where debug symbols bloat files but 2GB+ code sections signal engineering failures. Google veterans noted their workplace's reflex to "throw infrastructure" at bloat rather than fix root causes.  

Privacy tech got serious with "Staying ahead of censors," detailing how Tor now mimics HTTPS traffic to evade DPI. HN was silent on this, but the PySDR guide drew praise for making signal processing accessible via Python—perfect for pairing with cheap RTL-SDR hardware. On the user-facing side, GOG's acquisition by its founder was cautiously cheered as a win for DRM-free gaming, though skeptics questioned the "financially stable" narrative.  

Finally, nostalgia and satire rounded things out. The Star Trek set panoramas—resurrected from 90s QTVR files—had users geeking out over bridge bathrooms and shaky floors. The "not a battleship" critique demolished a proposed US Navy "fantasy ship" as political theater, comparing it to Homer Simpson's car. And the autism research study? HN praised its novel EEG method but roasted its tiny, demographically skewed sample (16 autistic adults, all White). One researcher in the thread warned that flooding receptors with glutamate could backfire, underscoring how far we are from "fixing" neurodivergence.  

**Worth watching**: The PySDR guide for its practical bridge between theory and code, and the Z80-μLM project as a blueprint for minimalist retro-computing hacks. Both prove that constraints breed creativity—unlike today's bloated binaries and CEO fantasies.
