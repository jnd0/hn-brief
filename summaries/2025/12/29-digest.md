The narrative of Google's decline isn't just a lament; it's a stark data point in the broader collapse of the open web. A small South African agency details the platform's enshittification—a collapse in lead quality and a surge in cost, leaving small businesses stranded. This isn't an isolated failure but a symptom of an ecosystem where the tools for discovery have been systematically choked, forcing users into walled gardens like TikTok for basic information. It’s the same pattern we see in the broader tech landscape: platforms that once enabled disruption now exist primarily to extract rent, whether from advertisers, developers, or end-users.

This extraction economy is being supercharged by the AI gold rush, which is creating a tangible, hardware-level crunch. The claim that AI is about to make your devices more expensive is a bit late; the bill for a decade of software bloat and speculative capital is already due. RAM prices are through the roof, and the supply chain is strained. The corporate giants, of course, have already locked in their long-term contracts, leaving smaller players and consumers to absorb the shock. It’s a classic case of socializing costs and privatizing gains, with the narrative of "AI demand" providing convenient cover for what looks a lot like coordinated price inflation.

Meanwhile, the promised revolution of the 4680 battery, the "holy grail" that was supposed to deliver a $25,000 Tesla, has imploded in a spectacular 99.999% write-down. This isn't just a supply chain hiccup; it's a microcosm of the company's trajectory, where grand promises consistently collide with messy reality. The disconnect between Tesla's valuation and its operational struggles is becoming a chasm, sustained by a cult of personality and financial engineering that looks increasingly precarious. When a company's sister firms have to buy its unsold trucks to prop up the numbers, you're not looking at a tech disruptor; you're looking at a house of cards.

This all happens against a backdrop of increasing control and surveillance. Germany's DNS blocks, a private initiative by media giants, are easily bypassed by changing your DNS provider, but they represent a creeping normalization of censorship. The Tor Project's new "mimicry" tactics are a brilliant technical response, but they also highlight the escalating cat-and-mouse game. The real battleground is the protocol level, where the fight is to make dissent look like mundane traffic. It's a technical arms race where the goal is to make the censor's job so fraught with collateral damage that it becomes untenable.

Of course, the industry's response to its own self-inflicted problems is to propose automating the most expensive roles. The idea of an AI CEO is laughable on its face, but it reveals a deep misunderstanding of what power actually is. A CEO's job isn't about processing data; it's about wielding soft power, navigating board politics, and being the legally accountable fall guy. You can't automate a scapegoat. The real reason this won't happen is that the people who would have to approve their own obsolescence are the ones holding the pen.

Amidst the decay, there are pockets of genuine, subversive creativity. The Z80-μLM project, an "LLM" in a 40KB executable for 1980s hardware, is a beautiful piece of nerdcore. It's a reminder that constraints breed ingenuity, and that the soul of programming isn't in generating slop, but in understanding a system so deeply you can make it sing. This stands in stark contrast to the "vibe coding" trend, which is already generating its own backlash. The critique that LLMs are "not fun" because they short-circuit the deep, immersive joy of craftsmanship is resonating with a lot of senior engineers. There's a growing schism between those who see AI as a force multiplier for drudgery and those who see it as a devaluation of the craft itself.

This tension between control and convenience is playing out in our very tools. The article on custom HTML tags is a perfect example. It’s a simple, powerful native feature that has been largely overshadowed by framework complexity. The discussion immediately jumped to Web Components, the "pro" version of this idea, which have been around for years but are only now being rediscovered as a viable alternative to the React-industrial complex. It’s a cycle as old as tech: we over-engineer solutions until we remember that the platform itself often has what we need.

And then there's the slow, grinding frustration of user experience. The eSIM saga is a masterclass in how "progress" can actually be a regression. The promise of convenience masks a system designed to lock you in, making it harder to switch carriers or devices. It’s a digital leash, sold as freedom. This is the same feeling that permeates so much of modern tech: the loss of user agency in exchange for a veneer of seamlessness.

We're left with a landscape of paradoxes. We have brilliant engineers building search engines as a public good, while the giants who built the open web are busy dismantling it. We have nostalgic projects running Go on a Sega Dreamcast, while modern apps struggle to run efficiently on a 16GB machine. We're debating the soul of programming while our hardware roadmaps are being dictated by the resource demands of data centers.

*Worth watching:* The fallout from the 4680 supply chain collapse will be a key indicator of Tesla's real health. Also, keep an eye on the "vibe coding" debate; as these tools mature, the divide between their utility for small scripts versus large systems will become a critical architectural consideration for engineering teams.
