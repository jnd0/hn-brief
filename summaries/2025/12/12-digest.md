# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-12

Good morning. If you needed any further proof that the tech world is currently locked in a frantic, capital-intensive arms race, look no further than the state of your RAM. Framework, the poster child for the right-to-repair movement, was forced to hike the price of its DDR5 memory kits by a staggering 50% this week. The culprit isn't corporate greed, but an insatiable beast: the AI industry. The company explicitly stated that massive AI infrastructure projects are hoovering up the global memory supply, creating a shortage so severe that it’s forcing prices up for everyone. This isn't an isolated issue; reports of major OEMs warning of similar hikes are everywhere. It feels like a new, permanent state of "AI inflation," where the pursuit of AGI is actively making the hardware we use for everyday computing more expensive and scarce.

This component crunch is a stark reminder of the physical realities underpinning our increasingly abstract digital world. It also ties into the broader theme of the day: the struggle for control and ownership. On the one hand, you have the raw, industrial-scale consumption of AI. On the other, you have the individual user's fight to simply own their experience. This week, the Hacker News community delivered a masterclass in this frustration, reacting with deep cynicism to an article on how to avoid "smart TV" invasiveness. The consensus was that the article's advice—simply not connecting your TV to the internet—is dangerously naive. Commenters argued that manufacturers are now building in hidden Wi-Fi, cellular modems, and local network scanners to ensure your data flows out regardless. The feeling is that the "Internet of Things" has become a "Internet of Things I Can't Control," a sentiment echoed by users who expressed a desire to buy older, "dumber" cars to escape the telemetry and invasive software of new models.

This battle for control extends to the very software that runs our lives. The Tor Project, a cornerstone of online privacy, announced it is officially switching its core implementation from C to Rust. This is a huge move for a critical piece of internet infrastructure, driven by the simple, undeniable need for memory safety that C can no longer guarantee. It’s a pragmatic, long-term bet on a more secure future. In a similar vein, OpenAI is quietly adopting a "Skills" feature in ChatGPT and Codex CLI, a direct parallel to Anthropic's approach. While not as flashy as a new model, this is a crucial piece of engineering: a way to package context and tools for AI agents without bloating the core prompt. It’s a clever abstraction for managing complexity, essentially formalizing the practice of "prompt stuffing" into a structured, shareable format. It’s less about AGI and more about building the necessary plumbing to make these powerful but brittle systems manageable.

Meanwhile, the legal and ethical battles over platform control are reaching new levels of absurdity. Epic Games is declaring "the end of the Apple Tax" after a court ruling that found Apple's ban on steering users to external payments was anti-competitive. But the victory is hollowed out by a "reasonable fee" loophole, which everyone expects Apple to exploit to the hilt. It feels less like a win for consumers and more like a reshuffling of deck chairs between two warring behemoths. On a more personal, and frankly more infuriating, level, the author of Bear Blog found their entire site de-indexed by Google with no explanation. This is the ultimate power imbalance: a single, opaque algorithm can effectively erase a creator's livelihood overnight. The HN discussion was a grim chorus of similar stories, highlighting the precariousness of building on a platform you don't own.

Of course, it wouldn't be a Hacker News digest without a healthy dose of nostalgia and niche engineering marvels. The community was captivated by "Nokia N900 Necromancy," a post detailing how to revive the 16-year-old Linux-based internet tablet by booting a modern OS from an SD card. It was a poignant eulogy for a time when mobile devices felt open and hackable, before the walled gardens of iOS and Android took over. In a similar spirit of pure, unadulterated tinkering, the "Rats Play DOOM" project drew admiration for its sheer audacity, even if the final video was missing. And for the pragmatists, there was a deep dive into how to get SQLite's JSON handling to run at "full index speed" using generated columns—a reminder that sometimes the most exciting developments are the ones that just make our databases a little bit faster.

Looking ahead, the most significant trend to watch is the growing schism between the centralized, capital-hungry AI world and the push for decentralized, user-controlled alternatives. We're seeing massive infrastructure projects like Apple's new RDMA-over-Thunderbolt feature for building AI clusters from Macs, alongside a deep-seated frustration with the opaque power of platforms like Google. This tension is creating a fertile ground for new ideas, from better open-source tools to a renewed interest in personal, self-hosted infrastructure. The question is whether the sheer momentum and capital of the former will simply steamroll the latter, or if a viable, user-first alternative can emerge.
