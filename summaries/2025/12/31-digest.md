# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-31

OpenAI's staggering cash burn is the elephant in the room, with The Economist questioning whether its spending is a necessary investment in AGI or an unsustainable bubble. The HN discussion dissected the term "cash burn," noting it's not money disappearing but flowing to vendors and employees, yet the valuation seems detached from reality. One user compared OpenAI's $500B+ valuation to the entire global chocolate market, highlighting the absurdity. The consensus leans toward skepticism, with many seeing this as a ploy to become "too big to fail" and secure a government bailout. The debate also touched on whether OpenAI has even trained a new foundational model since GPT-4o, suggesting their expenses might be overstated.

In a provocative thesis, the article "Win32 is the stable Linux ABI" argues that Microsoft's Win32 API has become a more reliable binary interface for Linux than the kernel itself. The author contends that Linux's rapid evolution forces constant recompilation, while Win32's backward compatibility makes it a stable target via Wine. HN commenters were split: some dismissed this as conflating API with ABI, pointing out that Linux's syscall ABI is remarkably stable. Others saw a kernel of truth, arguing that the fragmented Linux ecosystem creates instability for developers, making Win32's "stable by decree" model appealing for distribution.

The HSBC banking app's decision to block users with Bitwarden installed via F-Droid sparked outrage, epitomizing the clash between security theater and user autonomy. The bank's use of `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` to detect "unauthorized" apps like Bitwarden—likely due to its overlay permissions—was criticized as overreach. Many suggested switching to user-friendly banks like Monzo or using a separate "burner" phone. The discussion expanded to "de-banking" trends, where financial access is weaponized, raising concerns about digital rights.

Security practices were scrutinized in two stories. First, Libsodium patched a subtle Ed25519 verification flaw, reigniting debates about cryptographic implementation risks. While some praised the maintainer's responsiveness, others noted that Curve25519's design inherently mitigates such issues. Meanwhile, curl removed `strcpy` to dodge AI-generated vulnerability reports, replacing it with a custom function that fails safely. The move highlights the tension between AI scanners and real security, though some argued that modern AI analyzers are improving.

Infrastructure updates featured F-Droid's new server, hosted in a trusted contributor's basement—a choice that divided HN. Critics called it amateurish for a project that received a $400k grant, while defenders praised the control and simplicity. In a similar vein, FediMeteo and HackerBook showcased minimalist efficiency: a €4/month FreeBSD VPS powers a global weather service, and a 22GB HN archive runs in-browser via WebAssembly and sharded SQLite. Both projects prove that lightweight, clever engineering can rival cloud bloat.

The "Go away Python" article proposed using Go for shell scripting via a shebang hack, touting static binaries and performance. HN was skeptical, noting that Python's dependency management has improved with tools like `uv`, and Go's ergonomics for throwaway scripts are lacking. Charm Ruby, a port of Charmbracelet's TUI libraries to Ruby, drew excitement for filling a gap in Ruby's ecosystem, though some urged a more idiomatic API.

Swift concurrency's complexity was dissected, with debates on whether `async/await` simplifies threading or just hides it. While Swift's syntax was praised over Go's for readability, the cognitive load of actors and structured concurrency remains a hurdle. On the design front, Public Sans (US government font) and Times New Roman's political revival sparked discussions on legibility and culture wars. Public Sans was critiqued for its ambiguous characters, while Times New Roman's return was seen as an anti-woke stunt.

History lessons came from the British Empire's subsea telegraph network—a marvel of 19th-century engineering that connected the world. HN users reminisced about books like *The Victorian Internet* and sites like PK Porthcurno. Geopolitically, the US sanctioning of French ICC judge Nicolas Guillou drew ire for weaponizing finance against international law, accelerating de-dollarization. The move was seen as a dangerous precedent, eroding soft power.

In environmental tech, ETH Zurich's electrolysis method for decontaminating soil was lauded for breaking down pollutants into harmless salts and reusable benzene. But HN flagged benzene's carcinogenicity, questioning if it's a solution or a new problem. Finally, NYC's Mayoral inauguration banned Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero alongside explosives—a move HN mocked as security theater, noting the difficulty of enforcement and the irony of raising awareness for the devices.

Worth watching: The fallout from OpenAI's spending in 2026, as it may define the AI bubble's fate. Also, the push for alternative financial systems in response to US sanctions, which could reshape global tech infrastructure.
