# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-31

The most explosive story today is Ben Edelman's "Honey's Dieselgate," which tears the veil off PayPal's browser extension. Edelman alleges Honey uses a "selective stand down" algorithm that intentionally avoids standing down for regular users—meaning it snipes affiliate commissions from other creators even when they’re already present. Worse, Honey allegedly scrapes private discount codes (like employee-only ones) and then shakes down merchants to pay for their removal. The comparison to Volkswagen’s emissions fraud is deliberate: both involve engineering systems designed to evade detection. HN commenters largely validated the claims, noting Honey’s history of being banned by Amazon for abuse before pivoting to this model. The discussion highlighted how economic pressures force engineers to implement ethically dubious features, with many criticizing Google for allowing such extensions to proliferate in the Chrome Web Store.  

This scandal underscores a broader pattern of tech companies prioritizing growth over integrity, which bleeds into the AI discourse dominating the digest. OpenAI’s "cash burn" is framed as a 2026 bubble test, with HN skeptics arguing the spending is less about innovation and more about becoming "too big to fail" for a potential bailout. The debate mirrors the LLVM project’s new AI contribution policy, which mandates a "human in the loop" and forbids submitting code contributors don’t understand—a direct response to the flood of low-quality "slop" from AI tools. A study on professional developers reinforces this, finding they "control" AI with tests and architecture rather than "vibing," though commenters lament that many still abdicate responsibility for AI-generated code.  

The industrialization of software is another theme. One article argues AI tools like Claude are turning development into an assembly line, churning out "disposable software" that prioritizes quantity over quality. HN was split: some saw this as inevitable, while others countered that industrialization already happened decades ago with high-level languages, and AI is just a linear improvement. This ties into the "Everything as code" monorepo approach, where a company manages its entire business—from marketing to backend—in one repo. The twist? AI tools love monorepos for context, making this a pragmatic shift for teams using Claude, despite traditional concerns about scalability and deployment coordination.  

On the open-source front, ConcernedApe’s $125k donation to MonoGame (the framework behind *Stardew Valley*) was widely praised. At 40 million units sold, it’s a tiny investment to secure the engine powering a billion-dollar franchise. HN noted this as a positive trend, similar to Re-Logic donating to Godot. Meanwhile, the "Scry" project lets you query 600GB of HN/ArXiv data via Claude-generated SQL, but its closed-source nature and reliance on paid APIs drew skepticism. The creator cited "survival mode" finances, highlighting the tension between productizing tools and community expectations.  

Hardware and security stories reveal systemic fragility. NYC’s mayoral inauguration banned Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero alongside explosives—a move HN would likely call security theater. Bitcoin’s vulnerability to a "sabotage" attack (costing just billions to disrupt) sparked debates on Proof-of-Waste energy use, with some defending it as incentivizing stranded energy. In contrast, a new carbon capture material using low-temperature regeneration (80°C) was met with HN skepticism about scalability, with users arguing DAC is futile compared to source capture or forests, and questioning the ethics of underground storage.  

Medical tech made waves too: Japanese trials for a tooth-regrowth drug (targeting USAG-1 protein) promise new teeth in 4 years, but HN noted this is likely Phase 1 safety testing, not efficacy. Comments ranged from fears of "teeth in wrong places" to anecdotes about Vitamin K2 for dental health. Less credible was an article on airline water quality, which HN shredded for recommending hand sanitizer over soap (ineffective vs. norovirus) and dubious sourcing from the "Center for Food as Medicine."  

Finally, the human element: Austin Henley canceled a technical book deal over a $5k advance and publisher pressure to "involve AI," reflecting industry shifts. HN debated whether traditional publishing is worth the hassle, with many urging self-publishing. And in a rare feel-good moment, a simple "Happy New Year" post united commenters globally, with one hoping HN remains a "beacon of hope" for civil discourse—a stark contrast to the day’s cynicism.  

**Worth watching**: The LLVM AI policy could become a blueprint for open-source projects grappling with AI contributions, while Honey’s fallout may trigger broader scrutiny of affiliate fraud in browser extensions.
