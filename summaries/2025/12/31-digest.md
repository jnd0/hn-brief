# HN Daily Digest - 2025-12-31

The Honey browser extension scandal is the day's most damning story, with Ben Edelman's investigation revealing Dieselgate-level deception. The core allegation is that Honey runs a "selective stand-down" system: it detects affiliate marketers testing for compliance and behaves ethically for them, while for regular users it performs cookie stuffing, overwriting affiliate links to steal commissions. This isn't just a bug—it's a deliberate, sophisticated fraud mechanism. The parallel to Volkswagen's emissions cheating is apt: both involve systems designed to deceive auditors while profiting from unethical behavior in the wild. The fact that such a widely-installed extension operates with this level of calculated malice should be a wake-up call about the rot in the adtech ecosystem.

This scandal emerges alongside broader discussions about software ethics and infrastructure responsibility. The LLVM project's new AI policy—requiring human understanding and accountability for all submitted code—feels like a direct response to the "slop" flooding open-source projects. It's a necessary bulwark against the tide of developers submitting code they can't explain, a trend that mirrors Honey's own engineers presumably building their deceptive systems. Meanwhile, the F-Droid team's decision to host their critical build server in a contributor's home has drawn justified criticism. For a project that recently received a $400,000 grant, this "basement hosting" is amateurish and introduces a massive single point of failure—both physical and operational. It's a stark contrast to the meticulous engineering behind projects like the 22GB Hacker News SQLite archive, which cleverly uses WebAssembly and on-demand sharding to make massive datasets usable in-browser.

The infrastructure theme continues with FediMeteo, a weather service running on a €4/month FreeBSD VPS that handles global traffic through sheer optimization. This is the kind of elegant, minimalist engineering that feels increasingly rare. It stands in opposition to the "Everything as code" monorepo approach, which argues for cramming all business context—code, docs, plans—into one repository to feed AI assistants. While the monorepo might accelerate development, it also represents a surrender to AI's context limitations rather than a thoughtful architectural choice. The tension between these approaches—brute-force AI context versus lean, optimized systems—defines much of today's discourse.

Security discussions were dominated by two very different vulnerabilities. The Libsodium bug in its Ed25519 validation function is a subtle but critical flaw in a foundational library, highlighting how even widely-trusted crypto can harbor edge cases that break advanced protocols. On the Bitcoin front, a theoretical attack suggests that with 30% hashrate, an entity could reverse six-confirmations by strategically withholding blocks, potentially profiting from derivatives manipulation. Both stories reveal how theoretical weaknesses in complex systems can have real-world consequences, whether in cryptographic primitives or blockchain consensus.

The AI tooling debate produced fascinating insights. The "Professional software developers don't vibe" paper argues that successful AI usage requires treating agents as junior developers needing strict supervision—a view that clashes with the "vibe coding" hype. This aligns with the LLVM policy's emphasis on human accountability. Meanwhile, the "Scry" project demonstrates the practical application of AI for data querying, translating natural language to SQL across massive datasets. Yet even here, the community pushed back against proprietary solutions, demanding open-source alternatives—a reminder that trust remains a central issue.

Several projects showcased the enduring value of building from fundamentals. The HackerBook project's offline HN archive and the "Project ideas to appreciate the art of programming" list both emphasize deep understanding over superficial tool use. The latter faced skepticism about AI-generated content, but the underlying principle—building systems like BitTorrent clients or ray tracers to combat AI dependency—resonates. This contrasts with Google Opal, a "codeless" AI app builder that immediately drew "Google Graveyard" predictions and privacy concerns, illustrating the tension between convenience and lock-in.

The lighter stories provided some levity. The NYC Mayoral Inauguration banning Raspberry Pi alongside explosives is security theater at its most clueless, while the drinking water quality study sparked debate about whether airline hygiene advice is evidence-based or pseudoscience. The Public Sans font discussion revealed that even typography can't escape the gravitational pull of AI accusations and political commentary. And the electrolysis soil cleanup research—turning toxins into valuable chemicals—was tempered by the realization that benzene, a carcinogen, is one of the outputs.

Finally, the human teeth regeneration story exemplifies how incremental scientific progress gets sensationalized. While the underlying research is promising, the "4-year" timeline ignores the glacial pace of clinical trials. It's a fitting capstone to a day where skepticism about hype—whether in AI, crypto, or biotech—feels like the only rational stance.

**Worth watching**: The Honey scandal will likely trigger regulatory scrutiny and class actions, potentially reshaping the affiliate marketing industry. Meanwhile, the LLVM AI policy could become a template for other open-source projects grappling with AI-generated contributions.
