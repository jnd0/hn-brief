## [Apple Photos app corrupts images](https://tenderlovemaking.com/2025/09/17/apple-photos-app-corrupts-images/)
**Score:** 1214 | **Comments:** 439 | **ID:** 45274277

> **Article:** The article, by developer Aaron Patterson ("tenderlove"), details his investigation into why his photos were becoming corrupted. He discovered that the Apple Photos app was altering his image files during the import process. By comparing checksums of original files from his camera's SD card with the versions imported and saved by the Photos app, he confirmed that the files were being modified. He hypothesizes that the bug lies within the Photos app's import pipeline, which performs tasks like merging RAW+JPEG pairs and generating previews, potentially leading to a concurrency bug that corrupts the data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community engaged with the article in several ways. There was a mix of sympathy and skepticism, with some users questioning the methodology and suggesting that the corruption could be caused by faulty hardware (RAM, SSD, SD card) rather than the software. However, others corroborated the author's findings, sharing their own experiences with similar corruption, such as green lines of pixels or vertically flipped images, which they also suspected were caused by the Photos app.

The discussion also branched into related topics, including the risks of using the "delete after import" feature, the benefits of the RAW+JPEG workflow, and alternative methods for transferring photos to avoid Apple's ecosystem, such as using the native Image Capture app or third-party tools like Landrop. Several users shared past negative experiences with Apple's photo import tools, including a years-old Image Capture bug that appended empty data to files and another case where importing via Windows led to corruption. The conversation concluded with a consensus that the bug is likely in the Photos app's complex import pipeline and a shared frustration over the difficulty of reporting such nondeterministic bugs to Apple.

## [WASM 3.0 Completed](https://webassembly.org/news/2025-09-17-wasm-3.0/)
**Score:** 1086 | **Comments:** 494 | **ID:** 45279384

> **Article:** The article announces the official completion and release of WebAssembly (WASM) 3.0. This new version of the standard introduces several major features that have been highly anticipated by the community. The key additions include support for 64-bit memory (Memory64), which allows WASM applications to access more than 4GB of memory; garbage collection (WASM GC), which provides a low-level, managed memory model for structs and arrays; and exception handling. These features are designed to expand the capabilities of WASM, enabling more complex applications and making it a more viable compilation target for a wider range of programming languages, particularly those with high-level memory management needs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the WASM 3.0 release with a mix of excitement and technical scrutiny. The discussion centered on the implications of the new features, particularly performance and use cases.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the performance trade-offs of the new features. The introduction of 64-bit memory (Memory64) was met with both enthusiasm for breaking the 4GB barrier and concern over potential performance regressions. Commenters noted that while 32-bit WASM could elide bounds checks on 64-bit hosts by using the full address space, this optimization is not possible with a 64-bit WASM address space, leading to a potential slowdown. A link to a Spidermonkey blog post was shared, which quantifies this penalty, suggesting it can range from 10% to over 100% depending on the workload.

The addition of garbage collection (WASM GC) was a major point of interest. Many saw it as a crucial step to enable high-level languages like Kotlin, Java, or C# to run efficiently on the web without needing to bundle their own large, custom garbage collectors. However, some commenters cautioned that WASM GC is a low-level primitive and not a "silver bullet"; it provides the building blocks for compilers but doesn't automatically make it easy to port any language. The discussion also touched on practical concerns, such as whether WASM GC allows for shrinking memory, which remains an issue.

Exception handling was also discussed, with one user questioning its necessity. This was countered by others who argued it's vital for standardizing functionality that many compilers would otherwise have to emulate. A technical sub-thread explored whether the new exception handling supports restartable exceptions (like in Common Lisp), with the conclusion that it provides the necessary primitives but more advanced features would require the separate stack-switching proposal.

Finally, the discussion included clarifications on other topics. The Component Model was explicitly noted as *not* being part of the 3.0 release, as it is a separate, container-level proposal still under development. There was also a call for the AssemblyScript project to adopt the new WASM GC feature.

## [ABC yanks Jimmy Kimmel’s show ‘indefinitely’ after threat from FCC chair](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/media/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-trump-fcc-brendan-carr)
**Score:** 651 | **Comments:** 1070 | **ID:** 45282482

> **Article:** CNN reports that ABC has indefinitely pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show following a threat from Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The article notes that Carr, a Trump appointee, warned ABC regarding Kimmel's comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, suggesting that the network could face regulatory scrutiny over its broadcast licenses. The move is seen as a significant escalation in the ongoing political battle over media content and free speech.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of ABC's decision, viewing it as a capitulation to government pressure and a dangerous precedent for free speech. The dominant sentiment is that this represents a form of state-sponsored censorship, with many commenters noting the irony that the party formerly decrying "cancel culture" is now leveraging government power to silence critics.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Government Overreach:** Many users, such as wiskinator, argued that the real danger lies in ABC preemptively complying with the FCC's threats before an official order was issued, viewing this as a sign of a chilling effect where fear drives self-censorship.
*   **Hypocrisy and "Cancel Culture":** Commenters like armenarmen and paxys highlighted the perceived hypocrisy of the political right, who previously positioned themselves as defenders of free speech but are now using regulatory threats to remove a liberal voice from the airwaves.
*   **The Decline of Legacy Media:** A notable perspective, offered by tptacek, suggested a more pragmatic view: that the late-night TV format is dying anyway, and Kimmel might be using this controversy to exit gracefully and transition to a more relevant platform (like podcasting), similar to Bill Maher's move to HBO after being fired by ABC 20 years ago.
*   **The Role of the FCC:** Users clarified that unlike private boycotts, this involves direct government coercion (nba456_), distinguishing it from standard "cancel culture" debates and raising concerns about the state taking control of media narratives.

Overall, the discussion frames the event not just as a network decision, but as a significant political event signaling a shift in how media regulation is used as a weapon against political opposition.

## [GNU Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/)
**Score:** 525 | **Comments:** 310 | **ID:** 45271481

> **Article:** The article links to the official website for GNU Midnight Commander (mc), a text-based, dual-pane file manager. It is a free and open-source cross-platform clone of the classic Norton Commander for DOS. The tool provides a visual interface for file operations like copying, moving, and deleting, as well as an internal editor (mcedit) and viewer, all within a terminal environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely nostalgic, with users sharing personal stories of how Midnight Commander has been a reliable tool for decades. Many recall using it for critical tasks, such as recovering lost files after a mistaken `rm -rf` command or as their primary text editor before learning Vim. There is a recurring anecdote about `mc` being the solution for deleting files that start with a dash, which leads to a brief technical aside on the correct `rm -- -filename` syntax.

The conversation also delves into technical and philosophical aspects. One user explains the term "Orthodox File Manager," linking it to a UI philosophy where the interface is a direct visual layer over powerful, scriptable commands, making the software highly hackable. Practical use cases are shared, with some preferring `mc` for managing files on a NAS, while others note that modern GUI file managers like Dolphin have adopted similar powerful features. A humorous tangent involves users joking about running `mc` in a Docker container, highlighting the potential absurdity of containerizing a simple terminal tool.

## [The Asus gaming laptop ACPI firmware bug](https://github.com/Zephkek/Asus-ROG-Aml-Deep-Dive)
**Score:** 490 | **Comments:** 217 | **ID:** 45271484

> **Article:** The linked GitHub post, titled "The Asus gaming laptop ACPI firmware bug," alleges a significant firmware flaw in Asus ROG laptops that causes system stuttering. The bug is reportedly triggered when the laptop is set to discrete GPU (dGPU) only mode via its MUX switch, a common setting for gaming performance. The author claims this issue has affected all Asus laptops since 2021, leading to poor performance even during basic tasks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals widespread frustration with the state of laptop firmware, using the Asus bug as a focal point. While some commenters express skepticism about the article's technical accuracy, noting its style suggests it was AI-generated, the core issue resonates with many users' experiences.

A dominant theme is that this is not an isolated Asus problem but a systemic issue across the PC industry. Users share similar horror stories about Lenovo laptops with high CPU usage from unknown interrupts, unreliable GPU switching, and BIOS updates that fail to fix long-standing issues like coil whine. Others mention Dell's problems with dGPU power management and Microsoft Surface devices that suffer from critical battery charging failures. The consensus is that PC manufacturers, driven by cost and time-to-market, release products with buggy firmware and provide poor long-term support.

The conversation also explores potential solutions and the barriers to them. Users discuss the possibility of patching ACPI tables on Linux, but note that on Windows, this is difficult due to driver signing requirements and the risk of triggering anti-cheat software. This leads to a comparison with Apple's vertically integrated model, which, despite having its own firmware issues, offers a more controlled and often more reliable user experience. Ultimately, the discussion paints a bleak picture of the modern Windows laptop ecosystem, where users are often forced to develop workarounds for fundamental flaws in expensive hardware.

## [YouTube addresses lower view counts which seem to be caused by ad blockers](https://9to5google.com/2025/09/16/youtube-lower-view-counts-ad-blockers/)
**Score:** 422 | **Comments:** 780 | **ID:** 45276262

> **Article:** An article on 9to5Google reports that YouTube creators are experiencing a significant drop in view counts. The cause is believed to be a change in how YouTube counts views, specifically not counting views from users with ad blockers enabled. This change appears to affect the public view counter, but not necessarily the creator's revenue, as the uncounted views were from users who block ads and thus generate no revenue anyway. The move is seen as another step in YouTube's ongoing campaign against ad blockers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of YouTube's explanation and motives, with speculation falling into several key themes.

A dominant theory is that this is a deliberate policy decision rather than a technical issue. Users suggest the goal is to pressure creators into becoming anti-adblocker advocates, as a falling view count is a powerful motivator for creators to ask their audiences to disable ad blockers. The fact that revenue reportedly isn't dropping for some creators supports the idea that only "non-monetizable" views are being removed.

Many commenters use the opportunity to voice broader frustrations with the platform's declining quality. A major complaint is the poor state of the recommendation algorithm, which is described by some as a "sewage firehose" of low-quality content, AI-generated "slop," and rage-bait. This is contrasted by others who find their recommendations to be excellent, suggesting a highly variable user experience. This perceived degradation is leading some users to watch less or seek alternatives like NewPipe.

Finally, some users speculate that their own viewing habits have changed for other reasons, such as general fatigue with out-of-control sponsored segments or a shift to using LLMs for quick information instead of watching tutorial videos.

## [EU Chat Control: Germany's position has been reverted to undecided](https://mastodon.social/@chatcontrol/115215006562371435)
**Score:** 417 | **Comments:** 308 | **ID:** 45273854

> **Article:** The article reports that Germany's position on the EU's "Chat Control" proposal has reverted to "undecided," creating uncertainty for the legislation's future. The proposal would mandate the scanning of private messages for illegal content, effectively ending end-to-end encryption. Germany is a critical swing vote; its previous opposition formed a blocking minority. The article highlights internal German government conflict between the Ministry of the Interior (led by the conservative CDU/CSU) and the Ministry of Justice, with opposition MPs urging the government to uphold fundamental digital rights and prevent the "largest surveillance package the EU has ever seen."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the EU proposal, with users expressing alarm over privacy, government overreach, and the ineffectiveness of such measures against actual criminals.

A central theme is the mathematical and practical failure of mass surveillance. Users argue that scanning all messages would generate millions of false positives for every criminal caught, overwhelming law enforcement and treating innocent citizens as suspects. There is a strong consensus that this is not a tool for catching criminals but a mechanism for mass surveillance that criminals will easily bypass with custom software, leaving only the general public exposed.

Many commenters, particularly those referencing German history, express disbelief that a nation with the legacy of the Stasi and the Third Reich would enable such a system. They fear that authoritarian regimes could exploit this EU-wide infrastructure in the future. The discussion also highlights the "undemocratic" nature of the proposal, with users criticizing the EU's tendency to repeatedly vote on rejected measures until they pass. A notable point of cynicism is an exemption in the proposal that would prevent scanning of accounts used by the state for security and law enforcement, which users see as proof that the system is flawed and that the government is protecting itself from the very surveillance it imposes on citizens.

## [A postmortem of three recent issues](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 45281139

> **Article:** Anthropic published a postmortem detailing three infrastructure issues that degraded Claude's output quality for some users between August and September 2025. The company emphasized these were unintentional bugs, not deliberate changes. The three issues were:
1.  **Context Window Routing Error:** A load-balancing change incorrectly routed short-context requests to servers optimized for long contexts, degrading performance. This affected up to 16% of requests at its peak and impacted an estimated 30% of Claude Code users at least once due to "sticky" routing.
2.  **Output Corruption:** A TPU server misconfiguration caused runtime optimizations to incorrectly boost improbable tokens, leading to outputs in wrong languages or with syntax errors (e.g., "สวัสดี" in an English response).
3.  **Approximate Top-k Miscompilation:** A compiler bug in the TPU/XLA stack corrupted token probability selection, occasionally dropping the most likely token.

Anthropic noted that these subtle, intermittent bugs were missed by standard benchmarks and that privacy/safety rules limited their ability to debug using real user data. As next steps, they plan to implement more sensitive continuous evaluations and better debugging tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was highly critical of Anthropic's postmortem and the underlying issues. A central theme was skepticism about the company's transparency and motives. Many commenters felt the postmortem was vague, particularly regarding the scope of the XLA bug, and used "corporate gaslighting" by understating the impact. The fact that 30% of Claude Code users experienced degradation was highlighted as a massive failure, contradicting the narrative of a minor issue.

Debate emerged over the severity of the bugs versus user expectations. While some argued that paying for a service doesn't entitle one to zero bugs, others felt that degraded performance without credits or a clear SLA was unacceptable. Technical discussion clarified that LLMs are software stacks vulnerable to human-written code bugs, with one commenter explaining the TPU miscompilation likely occurred in the token-sampling kernel.

Several users expressed concern over the lack of guarantees in Anthropic's ToS regarding response quality, which they felt left them powerless against "vibe-based" performance. Other notable points included surprise at Anthropic's heavy use of TPUs (implying GCP over AWS) and criticism of the company for never releasing open-source models. Ultimately, the discussion painted a picture of eroding trust, with a call for more honest and less sanitized corporate communication.

>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a widespread and heartfelt tribute to Ton Roosendaal and the impact of Blender. The community expresses immense gratitude for his vision and leadership, with many commenters crediting Blender for their careers in 3D art, especially because it was a free and accessible tool during their youth.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Personal Impact:** Numerous users share personal stories of discovering Blender in the early 2000s, highlighting how its free nature provided a gateway to digital art that they couldn't have afforded otherwise. Roosendaal is frequently described as a "hero" and an inspiration.
*   **Open-Source Success:** Commenters celebrate Blender as a monumental achievement in open-source software, contrasting its polished, industry-standard status with its difficult early reputation. Its success is seen as a model for how software can be both free and world-class.
*   **Legacy and Transition:** There is a strong sense of respect for Roosendaal's work, particularly in navigating the project's complex history and ensuring its survival and growth. The community is reassured that the transition is to new leadership (Francesco Siddi) who are deeply embedded in the project and its culture.
*   **Broader Principles:** The discussion extends to a wish that more software, especially proprietary products from defunct companies, would be open-sourced. Blender is held up as a prime example of the immense value that can be created when tools are made freely available to the world.

## [About the security content of iOS 15.8.5 and iPadOS 15.8.5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/125142)
**Score:** 358 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 45270108

> **Article:** Apple released a security update, iOS 15.8.5 and iPadOS 15.8.5, for older devices like the iPhone 6S and iPad Air 2. The patch addresses a single vulnerability (CVE-2025-43200) in the Image I/O framework, which could lead to memory corruption when processing a malicious image file. Apple notes it is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in "an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals," suggesting a zero-click exploit likely delivered via an image in a messaging app.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on three main themes: the exceptional longevity of Apple's software support, the technical reasons behind the disparity with Android, and the severity of the vulnerability itself.

A significant portion of the conversation praises Apple for continuing to patch a device that is nearly a decade old, contrasting this with the "abandonware" state of many Android phones. Users note that while their old iPhones remain functional, their old Android devices are often unusable due to lack of updates. The technical reason for this difference is identified as Apple's vertical integration; they control the entire hardware and software stack, whereas Android support is limited by chipmakers like Qualcomm who stop providing driver updates after a few years. Some commenters push back, arguing that OS-level security patches are still possible even without vendor support, but the consensus leans toward Apple's model being superior for long-term security.

The vulnerability itself is analyzed as a likely zero-click remote code execution (RCE) exploit, possibly chained with a WhatsApp vulnerability to target specific individuals. This context elevates the patch from a routine update to a critical intervention against a sophisticated threat. Finally, there is a side discussion about the iPhone 6S specifically, with one user highlighting its value for hobbyists and tinkerers due to its still-active support in developer tools and the existence of jailbreaks.

## [One Token to rule them all – Obtaining Global Admin in every Entra ID tenant](https://dirkjanm.io/obtaining-global-admin-in-every-entra-id-tenant-with-actor-tokens/)
**Score:** 331 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 45282497

> **Article:** The article by Dirk-jan Molkenmeijer details a critical security vulnerability in Microsoft's Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) that could allow an attacker with initial access to a single tenant to escalate privileges to Global Admin in *every* Entra ID tenant worldwide. The flaw stems from "Actor tokens," a type of impersonation token Microsoft uses for backend service-to-service communication. These tokens are powerful, long-lived, and crucially, are not subject to security policies like Conditional Access. The vulnerability was triggered by a failure to properly validate the 'tenant' ID within these tokens. By manipulating this field, an attacker could forge a token that would be accepted by the APIs of any other tenant, effectively granting universal administrative access. The author responsibly disclosed the issue to Microsoft, who patched it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reacted with a mixture of shock, cynicism, and unsurprised resignation. The primary sentiment was that the vulnerability was a catastrophic failure of security design, with many commenters expressing disbelief that such a fundamental flaw could exist in a major enterprise product. The concept of "Actor tokens" was heavily criticized for being a "God-mode" backdoor that bypasses standard security controls, leading some to speculate it was an intentional design choice or a symptom of widespread poor practices in managing non-human identities.

There was significant criticism directed at Microsoft's Entra ID platform itself. Commenters described it as overly complex, poorly designed, and a confusing mix of legacy and modern systems, contrasting it unfavorably with older, more robust protocols like Kerberos. This view was supported by anecdotes of the difficulty in navigating Entra's ecosystem. A recurring theme was that Microsoft is trapped by its need to support legacy systems for large enterprise clients, which creates a fertile ground for such vulnerabilities where new features interact with old, unpatched code. The discussion concluded with a cynical view of the "security industry" and the business incentives that perpetuate complex and often insecure systems.

## [How to motivate yourself to do a thing you don't want to do](https://ashleyjanssen.com/how-to-motivate-yourself-to-do-a-thing-you-dont-want-to-do/)
**Score:** 323 | **Comments:** 227 | **ID:** 45276987

> **Article:** The article by Ashley Janssen provides a practical framework for overcoming procrastination on tasks you don't want to do. It rejects the idea of waiting for motivation and instead advocates for a deliberate process. The core steps are:
1.  **Acknowledge and Accept:** Recognize your resistance without judgment.
2.  **Identify the 'Why':** Connect the unpleasant task to a larger, meaningful personal value or goal.
3.  **Break It Down:** Divide the task into the smallest possible first step to reduce the barrier to entry.
4.  **Just Start:** Commit to only that tiny first step, leveraging the principle that action often precedes motivation.
5.  **Create a System:** Use "temptation bundling" (pairing the task with something enjoyable, like listening to a podcast while cleaning) and set a specific time to do the work.
6.  **Celebrate:** Acknowledge completion to reinforce the positive behavior.

The overarching message is to shift from an emotion-driven approach (waiting to "feel like it") to a system-driven one that makes the task easier to begin and complete.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion critically examines the article's advice, with many users pointing out that its effectiveness depends heavily on individual psychology and circumstances. A central theme is the distinction between a lack of motivation and underlying neurological conditions. Several commenters with ADHD argue that standard productivity advice is ineffective for them, as their primary challenge is "executive dysfunction," not a failure of will or a lack of compelling reasons. They note that neurotypical strategies often fail to account for the fundamental differences in how their brains initiate tasks.

Another significant thread critiques the article's suggestion of "temptation bundling" (e.g., listening to music while working). One user argues this is a form of "dopamine stacking" that can be counterproductive, as it trains the brain to require an external stimulus to perform a task, ultimately raising the baseline for motivation and making the core activity itself less rewarding.

Other discussion points include:
*   **Reframing the Problem:** A user suggests the real issue isn't doing something you *never* want to do, but rather acting on something you *currently* lack the motivation for but *ultimately* believe is valuable.
*   **Alternative Strategies:** One commenter advocates for John Carmack's method of intense, focused "staring" at a problem until progress is made, while another highlights the power of social motivation (working with others or sharing progress).
*   **The Role of Language:** A side conversation touched on how corporate jargon can feel like an arbitrary and disconnected system of words, separate from genuine thought.

## [Alibaba's new AI chip: Key specifications comparable to H20](https://news.futunn.com/en/post/62202518/alibaba-s-new-ai-chip-unveiled-key-specifications-comparable-to)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 308 | **ID:** 45273747

> **Article:** The article reports on Alibaba's newly unveiled AI chip, which is positioned as a competitor to NVIDIA's H20. The H20 is a modified, lower-performance chip that NVIDIA created specifically for the Chinese market to comply with US export controls. The new Alibaba chip's specifications are comparable to this restricted H20 model, not to NVIDIA's top-tier global offerings. The context for this announcement is China's push for technological self-sufficiency amid ongoing US trade restrictions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on whether this development signals a genuine technological breakthrough for China or a strategic response to geopolitical pressure. A key theme is the re-evaluation of NVIDIA's "moat." Many commenters argue that NVIDIA's dominance is built less on un replicable hardware and more on its software ecosystem (CUDA) and market inertia. They contend that US export controls have inadvertently destroyed this moat within China, forcing the country to build a parallel ecosystem and creating a viable market for domestic chips that wouldn't have otherwise existed.

The conversation also explores the practical challenges of this rapid development. While some are skeptical of the chip's true performance and reliability, citing issues with other Chinese chips (like Huawei's), others believe the immense state-backed incentives will overcome these hurdles. The comparison to AMD is frequently made; commenters suggest that Chinese firms have an advantage over AMD because they are backed by the state, which can absorb losses for years to achieve strategic dominance, a luxury a public company like AMD does not have. Ultimately, many see this as a pivotal moment that could end NVIDIA's global monopoly by creating a powerful, non-Western alternative and a split in the global technology market.

## [Determination of the fifth Busy Beaver value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12337)
**Score:** 288 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 45273999

> **Article:** This paper on arXiv details the formal determination of the fifth Busy Beaver number, BB(5). The Busy Beaver problem seeks the maximum number of steps a Turing machine with a given number of states can take before halting. For 5-state machines, this value was long sought but unproven. The authors, as part of the "bbchallenge" project, developed a formal proof using the Rocq proof assistant. Their method involved exhaustively enumerating all essentially different 5-state Turing machines and then systematically classifying them as halting or non-halting using a pipeline of deciders. These deciders use various techniques, from simple loop detection to more complex abstract analysis (NGram, RepWL, FAR/WFAR), to prove non-halting behavior. Any machines not handled by the automated deciders were proven by hand and then formally verified. The result confirms that the champion machine, which runs for 47,176,870 steps, is indeed the longest-running halting 5-state machine, thus establishing the exact value of BB(5).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the methodology, collaborative nature, and significance of the BB(5) result. A primary point of clarification was the distinction between brute-force simulation and the project's sophisticated approach. While initial simulations were run, the core of the proof relied on a series of formally verified deciders to classify machines that ran for extremely long periods, as brute force alone cannot prove a machine will never halt.

The project's collaborative and open nature was highly praised. Commenters noted that this effort, coordinated through the bbchallenge.org site, is a great example of online, distributed mathematical research. This was compared to other collaborative proof projects, such as those using the Lean proof assistant for the "Equational Theories" project.

Several users provided a high-level overview of the proof pipeline, explaining how the deciders progressively reduced the problem from millions of candidate machines down to a handful, which were then proven by hand. The use of the Rocq proof assistant to formally verify the entire classification was highlighted as a key feature, ensuring the result's correctness.

On the practical side, most agreed that the work is purely academic with no direct, immediate applications. However, it was noted that the techniques for program analysis developed for this project could potentially inspire new methods for verifying the correctness of more complex, practical software. Other interesting tidbits included the fact that the champion 5-state machine computes a Collatz-like sequence, and that BB(6) is so astronomically large that an exact value is likely impossible to ever write down.

## [DeepSeek writes less secure code for groups China disfavors?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/16/deepseek-ai-security/)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 45278740

> **Article:** A Washington Post article, based on research from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, alleges that the AI model DeepSeek produces less secure code when prompted for projects associated with groups that are disfavored by the Chinese government. The article claims that when requests included references to Uighurs, Taiwanese individuals, or Falun Gong, the code generated by DeepSeek was more likely to contain security vulnerabilities compared to neutral prompts. The findings were presented without detailed methodology or published prompts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and critical of the article's claims and journalistic standards. The dominant sentiment is that the report is a low-quality, sensationalized piece of propaganda that lacks scientific rigor. Commenters repeatedly point out the absence of specific prompts, methodology, or comparisons to other AI models, making the findings impossible to verify. Many dismiss it as "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) and a poor example of journalism, with some noting the source's (CrowdStrike) commercial interests and the Washington Post's perceived decline in quality.

However, a few users engaged with the underlying premise, offering alternative explanations for the alleged behavior. One theory suggests that the model's "pro-China" training could lead it to implicitly associate certain groups with negative outcomes, resulting in lower-quality code as an emergent property. Another perspective posits that the model might be generalizing from training data where requests involving sanctioned entities (like Iran) are often rejected, leading it to produce subpar responses for other disfavored groups. A minority of comments defended the report's plausibility, arguing that security firms are credible sources and that such proprietary research is often shared without full public disclosure.

## [DeepMind and OpenAI win gold at ICPC](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/146536)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 248 | **ID:** 45279357

> **Article:** The article links to a Codeforces blog post announcing that DeepMind and OpenAI have achieved gold medal-level performance at the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) World Finals. This follows recent achievements where AI models reached gold medal standards at the IMO (Mathematics) and IOI (Informatics). The post highlights that AI is now matching or exceeding top human performance in highly structured competitive programming and problem-solving contests.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding this achievement is polarized, centering on the validity of the benchmarks, the accessibility of the technology, and the implications for the future.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the relevance of these contests to real-world utility. Skeptics argue that competitive programming problems are highly structured, unambiguous, and similar to database lookups, making them fundamentally different from the ambiguous, "less structured problem spaces" of professional software engineering. Several users shared personal anecdotes of current AI models failing at basic code reviews or hallucinating bugs, suggesting a disconnect between contest performance and daily tool reliability. One commenter noted that while AI mastered Go in 2015, it took another seven years to produce useful coding agents, suggesting that success in one "hard" domain doesn't immediately translate to others.

Regarding the results themselves, there is significant skepticism about the methodology and transparency. Users questioned the "black box" nature of the wins, specifically the lack of details regarding compute costs, model architecture, and the number of attempts allowed (e.g., one model succeeded on its 9th submission). Many argued that these results are the product of massive, "unreasonable" amounts of compute and inference-time manipulation that are not replicable by the average user, turning the race into a "marketing circus" to justify high valuations.

Finally, the discussion touched on the broader impact. While some expressed excitement about scientific advancements, others voiced concern over the lack of transparency and the potential for job displacement. There was also a minor thread regarding the ethics of training data, with one user suggesting "poisoning" the internet to protect human knowledge, while others argued that the concept of copyright is evolving and may not apply to AI training in the same way it does to human consumption.

## [Anthropic irks White House with limits on models’ use](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/17/2025/anthropic-irks-white-house-with-limits-on-models-uswhite-house-with-limits-on-models-use)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 45279143

> **Article:** An article from Semafor reports that Anthropic has refused to grant the US government unlimited access to its AI models for certain uses, citing its safety-focused terms of service which prohibit applications like surveillance or weapons development. The article frames this as a point of friction with the White House, suggesting it limits the value and utility of the AI for government agencies. It contrasts Anthropic's stance with other tech companies that are more willing to accommodate government requests, implying that Anthropic's restrictions are a business liability and an obstacle to national interests.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the Semafor article, with commenters largely defending Anthropic's position. The consensus is that a company setting clear terms of service is standard business practice, and the government is not entitled to use technology in ways that violate those terms. Many users found the article's tone to be "whiny" and misleading, arguing that it misrepresents contract restrictions as a surprising or unreasonable action.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Support for Anthropic's Stance:** Many commenters viewed Anthropic's refusal as a principled and ethical decision, praising them for "not bending the knee" to government pressure and taking safety seriously. Some even saw it as a reason to think better of the company.
*   **Critique of the Article's Premise:** Users dismissed the article's core complaint. They argued that government agencies, like any large entity, are fully capable of reading and understanding contracts before signing. The idea that they would be caught off-guard by usage restrictions was seen as absurd.
*   **Corporate Control vs. Local Software:** A sub-thread used this as an argument for the superiority of local-first software over SaaS models, where the provider retains ultimate control. However, others pointed out that EULAs can still impose restrictions on on-premise software.
*   **Government Power Dynamics:** Some commenters debated whether the government could use its power (e.g., withdrawing contracts) to force Anthropic to comply, viewing this as a potential threat to a free market. Others expressed shock at this idea, noting it was once normal for companies to choose whether or not to do business with the government.
*   **Misunderstandings and Clarifications:** A minor point of confusion was whether Anthropic was a "foreign corporation," which was quickly corrected. There was also some discussion about the technical means of enforcing such restrictions (e.g., via API vs. baked into model weights).

## [Optimizing ClickHouse for Intel's ultra-high core count processors](https://clickhouse.com/blog/optimizing-clickhouse-intel-high-core-count-cpu)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 45279792

> **Article:** The article from the ClickHouse team details the performance optimizations required to run their analytical database effectively on Intel's new high-core-count processors, specifically the Sierra Forest (E-cores) and Granite Rapids (P-cores) chips. It highlights that scaling to 128+ cores introduces new bottlenecks beyond simple parallelization. Key challenges include memory allocator contention, where the default `jemalloc` can become a bottleneck, and memory bandwidth saturation, as more cores compete for finite memory channels. The authors discuss their tuning process, which involves selecting a suitable memory allocator (like `jemalloc` with specific configurations), managing NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) topologies to ensure cores access local memory, and setting CPU frequency governors to "performance" mode. The goal is to minimize latency and contention, allowing the massive core count to translate into real-world query performance gains.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with deep technical interest, focusing on the underlying principles of high-core-count computing. A central theme was the challenge of memory subsystems. One commenter noted that in bioinformatics, random RAM access is a major bottleneck, while another argued that the most effective optimization is to design algorithms that minimize inter-core communication, as moving data between cores is orders of magnitude slower than L1 cache access.

The conversation also touched on the hardware specifics of Intel's new chips. Commenters pointed out that the E-core (Efficient-core) Sierra Forest processors lack AVX-512 support, which is reserved for the P-cores in Granite Rapids, making them less suitable for certain vector-heavy workloads. There was also a discussion about the choice of memory allocator, with some surprised that ClickHouse still uses `jemalloc` over newer alternatives like `mimalloc`, though others defended `jemalloc`'s strengths for long-running, large-object workloads typical of databases.

Finally, the discussion included praise for ClickHouse as a product, with users sharing positive experiences with its compression and query speed, and a minor debate over C++ coding conventions sparked by the article's style. Overall, the comments reflect a sophisticated understanding of the hardware-software interface and the practical difficulties of leveraging modern server architecture.

## [Claude can sometimes prove it](https://www.galois.com/articles/claude-can-sometimes-prove-it)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 45275058

> **Article:** The article "Claude can sometimes prove it" explores the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Interactive Theorem Provers (ITPs) like Lean. The author argues that while LLMs are powerful at generating code, they often produce incorrect or "hallucinated" solutions. ITPs provide a rigorous, automated feedback loop that verifies the correctness of proofs and code. By giving an LLM access to an ITP, it can iteratively generate a solution, check the proof, receive specific error messages, and correct its own mistakes. The author demonstrates this by having Claude Code formalize a mathematical proof, showing that this combination allows the AI to achieve a level of correctness and autonomy that is difficult to attain with conventional methods. The core insight is that providing AI with a tool for empirical validation (in this case, a proof checker) dramatically improves its performance and reliability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central premise, agreeing that combining generative AI with formal methods is a highly promising path forward for software development. The key themes are:

*   **Empirical Validation as the Key Enabler:** Several commenters highlight that the most important takeaway is the power of providing AI with a tool for "empirical validation." Whether it's a proof assistant, a linter, or a test suite, this feedback loop allows the AI to self-correct and iterate rapidly, removing the human from the loop and dramatically increasing success rates.
*   **The Synergy of LLMs and Formal Methods:** The combination is seen as a "match made in heaven." LLMs excel at the creative, implementation-heavy work of writing code and proofs, while ITPs handle the tedious but crucial task of verification, reducing the massive review effort required from humans.
*   **Specifications are the Real Challenge:** A recurring point is that the fundamental difficulty in software is not writing the code, but specifying what it should do correctly. Formal methods force a clear specification, which is a hard problem for both humans and AI. Some hope that AI can help humans become better at writing these specifications.
*   **Skepticism and Practical Concerns:** Not all comments were purely optimistic. One major skeptical point is the classic "90% done" problem, where AI can quickly generate the bulk of a project but struggles to complete the final, tricky 10%, making initial progress estimates unreliable. Others questioned how to verify the proof code itself, though the Curry-Howard correspondence was cited as the theoretical guarantee of correctness if the proof compiles.
*   **Broader Applications:** The principle was seen as applicable beyond theorem proving. Commenters mentioned the high value of investing in better linters and static analysis, as these provide the same kind of clear, actionable feedback that helps AI (and humans) iterate more effectively.

## [Firefox 143 for Android to introduce DoH](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/dns-android/)
**Score:** 218 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 45275444

> **Article:** The article from the Mozilla blog announces that Firefox 143 for Android will introduce a built-in DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) feature. The post explains that this technology encrypts DNS queries, which are typically sent in plain text, thereby preventing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and others on the network from eavesdropping on a user's browsing activity. The feature is designed to enhance user privacy by plugging a significant data leak.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a multifaceted debate around the new feature, centered on privacy, centralization, and practical implementation.

A primary point of contention is the necessity of a browser-level DoH implementation. One user questions why Firefox needs its own when Android already supports it, prompting a debate on corporate incentives. The top reply suggests the reason is privacy, but another user argues it's more about data collection, positing that browser makers want to control valuable query statistics themselves or protect users from the OS or ISP. However, another user clarifies that DoH is merely a transport protocol, and the centralization concern stems specifically from Firefox's "trusted recursive resolver" model, contrasting it with Chrome's approach which doesn't change the underlying resolver.

The theme of centralization was a significant concern, with users worried about consolidating DNS traffic with a few large providers like Cloudflare. In response, users suggested alternative, privacy-focused providers such as Mullvad and Quad9, and one commenter pointed to academic research on how to mitigate centralization by spreading queries across multiple resolvers.

Several comments focused on the practical limitations and nuances of DoH's privacy promises. One user argued that DoH is insufficient because the target hostname is still visible in the unencrypted TLS Client Hello (SNI), a point another user countered by explaining that while the ISP can't see the specific hostname, the destination IP (e.g., a major cloud provider) makes the request less meaningful. A deeper technical dive highlighted that the widespread lack of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) means ISPs can still easily log hostnames.

Finally, the discussion included practical considerations. One user asked how network administrators could force-disable DoH, leading to a technical conversation about the difficulty of blocking TLS traffic on port 443 without "break-and-inspect" methods. Another user veered off-topic to criticize Firefox for Android's performance and extension support, though others defended it. There was also a note from a Waterfox developer about their implementation, which includes an additional DNS-over-Oblivious HTTP (DoOH) setting for enhanced privacy.
