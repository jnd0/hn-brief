## [F-Droid and Google’s developer registration decree](https://f-droid.org/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html)
**Score:** 1478 | **Comments:** 564 | **ID:** 45409794

> **Article:** The F-Droid project published an article expressing strong opposition to Google's new "developer registration decree." This policy requires all app developers to verify their identity with Google to have their apps installed on certified Android devices in specific regions (Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand), with a global rollout expected.

F-Droid argues this is a dangerous centralization of power that undermines user freedom, the open-source ethos, and the ability to distribute software outside of corporate control. They state they cannot comply by simply signing apps with their own keys, as this would violate app licensing and centralize distribution rights. The article is a call to action, urging users and developers to oppose the policy through advocacy and supporting organizations like the EFF.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Google's policy, viewing it as a significant step towards a locked-down mobile ecosystem. Key themes include:

*   **Loss of Freedom and Openness:** Many commenters express sadness and frustration, seeing this as the "end of open phones" and a move towards a more restrictive, Apple-like model. Some fear this trend will extend to the web.
*   **Security vs. Control:** While some acknowledge the policy is intended to combat scams and malware, others argue it's a pretext for control. A recurring point is that determined criminals will simply pay for "verified" identities, while legitimate open-source developers and users are harmed.
*   **Legal and Licensing Conflicts:** A technical discussion highlights a potential conflict with the GPLv3 license, which requires users to be able to install modified versions of software. The new registration requirement could violate this by tying installation to Google's approval.
*   **Geopolitical and Censorship Risks:** Commenters raise concerns that this system could be used for political censorship, especially if a country falls under sanctions, preventing citizens from accessing local or approved apps.
*   **Alternatives and Apathy:** The community discussed alternatives like GrapheneOS, LineageOS, and Linux-based phones, but acknowledged their limitations (compatibility, availability). A sense of resignation is present, with some users stating they might just give up on smartphones if this continues.
*   **Broader Context:** The debate was broadened to include a critique of corporate power, government regulation, and the erosion of digital rights in general, linking this specific issue to a larger societal trend.

## [Claude Code 2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code)
**Score:** 842 | **Comments:** 413 | **ID:** 45416228

> **Article:** The article announces the release of Claude Code 2.0, a major update to Anthropic's command-line interface (CLI) tool for coding with AI. Key updates include a new native VS Code extension, UI improvements, conversation history features (like `/rewind` and `Ctrl-R` search), and a new SDK (now called the Claude Agent SDK) that supports dynamic subagents. The release also introduces a `/usage` command to track plan limits.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on user reactions to the update, comparisons with competitors, and specific feature changes. Key points include:

*   **Plan Mode Removal:** A major point of contention is the removal of "Plan mode," which allowed users to use the more powerful Opus model for planning and Sonnet for implementation. Users expressed frustration with this change, while others noted it wasn't mentioned in the official changelog.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Users compared Claude Code to alternatives like Goose, Gemini CLI, and the original Aider. Some felt Goose was sufficient, while others praised Claude Code's native feel. A commenter noted that Aider's architecture has long offered similar capabilities.
*   **Feature Feedback:** The new `Ctrl-R` for history search was well-received. However, a regression was noted: tab-completion for filenames has been removed in favor of an `@file` syntax similar to Codex.
*   **General Sentiment:** While many users appreciated the new features (especially "checkpoints"), the removal of Plan mode created significant negative sentiment, with some users vowing to stick with other tools.

## [What if I don't want videos of my hobby time available to the world?](https://neilzone.co.uk/2025/09/what-if-i-dont-want-videos-of-my-hobby-time-available-to-the-entire-world/)
**Score:** 674 | **Comments:** 736 | **ID:** 45412419

> **Article:** The author expresses frustration over the erosion of privacy in personal hobbies, specifically using their airsoft hobby as an example. They argue that the expectation to record and share activities online has turned leisure time into "content" for algorithms and monetization. The author rejects the common rebuttal that "if you don't want to be filmed, stay out of public spaces," asserting that one should be able to exist in society without being constantly recorded and broadcast to the world.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is divided on the balance between privacy rights and freedom of expression in public spaces.

*   **Privacy vs. Public Expectation:** Many users empathize with the author's discomfort, particularly regarding the permanence and global reach of digital recordings compared to fleeting observation in a physical public space. Others argue that there is no legal or logical expectation of privacy in public, and that recording is a fundamental right.
*   **Legal and Cultural Context:** Commenters note that laws vary by country (e.g., UK vs. Germany). While filming in public is generally legal in places like the UK and Australia, some argue that social norms should dictate asking for consent, especially when monetizing footage of others.
*   **The "Private Venue" Nuance:** Several users pointed out that the specific example (an airsoft game) likely takes place on private property. This shifts the debate from public rights to venue policy, where rules regarding consent and filming could be enforced by the organizers.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** Suggestions ranged from practical (asking friends not to post, finding a different group) to systemic (wearing a lanyard to signal "do not record," or venues enforcing consent rules).
*   **Broader Implications:** The conversation expanded to include the impact of smart glasses (like Meta Ray-Bans) and "influencer culture," with many fearing that the normalization of constant recording will make mundane activities stressful or impossible to enjoy without being "content."

## [I built ChatGPT with Minecraft redstone [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaeI9YgE1o8)
**Score:** 440 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 45410068

> **Article:** A YouTube video demonstrates the creation of a functional small language model (similar to ChatGPT) entirely within the Minecraft game environment. The creator built a 5-million-parameter neural network using redstone mechanics. The system is massive (over 1,000 blocks wide) and was trained in Python. To make the inference feasible, the creator used a server mod to speed up the game's "tick rate" by 40,000x; otherwise, generating a single response would take over nine years at normal game speed.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction was a mix of awe and curiosity regarding the engineering process. While many initially suspected the use of "command blocks" (which allow for custom code injection), it was clarified that the build relies purely on redstone logic. Commenters discussed how such a massive structure was built, concluding that while the logic design was manual, the placement of blocks was likely automated using external tools, mods for copy-pasting, or libraries that generate Minecraft structure files programmatically. The consensus is that the project is a monumental technical achievement, regardless of the building methods used.

## [Meta-analysis of 2.2M people: Loneliness increases mortality risk by 32%](https://lightcapai.medium.com/the-loneliness-epidemic-threatens-physical-health-like-smoking-e063220dde8b)
**Score:** 358 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 45413481

> **Article:** This article, citing a meta-analysis of 2.2 million people, argues that loneliness is a major public health crisis, increasing mortality risk by 32%—a danger comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. The author, Lightcap AI, details how social isolation leads to measurable negative health outcomes like increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and dementia. The piece frames loneliness as an "epidemic" that physically harms the body, urging for it to be treated with the same seriousness as other major health risks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds crucial nuance and skepticism. Key points include:

*   **Causation vs. Correlation:** A primary debate is whether loneliness directly causes mortality or if it's a confounding variable. Some argue that poor health can cause both isolation and early death, while others suggest the link is partly practical (e.g., no one to call for an emergency).
*   **The Role of Technology:** Commenters draw a strong analogy between social media and "ultra-processed food"—hyper-palatable but ultimately socially malnourishing. There is a consensus that online interactions are less potent than in-person ones.
*   **Practical vs. Psychological Solutions:** Many commenters are skeptical of "mindfulness" as a solution, arguing it only makes being alone more tolerable without addressing the real-world dangers (e.g., medical emergencies) or the fundamental human need for connection.
*   **Structural Causes:** The problem is seen as deeply rooted in modern societal structures, not just individual choice.
*   **Anecdotal Evidence:** Users share personal experiences that align with the findings, such as the fear of living alone during a medical crisis and the observation that social connection is what keeps the elderly going.

Overall, the community agrees on the severity of the issue but questions the simplistic causality and proposed solutions, emphasizing the need for real-world community and structural change.

## [What is “good taste” in software engineering?](https://www.seangoedecke.com/taste/)
**Score:** 342 | **Comments:** 229 | **ID:** 45410940

> **Article:** The article "What is 'good taste' in software engineering?" by Sean Goedecke argues that "taste" is not an innate quality but a set of prioritized engineering values. He identifies several common values that contribute to good taste: prioritizing the user experience (UX), valuing simplicity and readability over cleverness, ensuring maintainability and modularity, and favoring development speed. Good taste is presented as the ability to make effective trade-offs between these values, such as choosing a simple solution that is "good enough" over a complex, "perfect" one. The article also touches on how taste can be developed and how it differs from raw technical skill.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance and skepticism. Key points include:

*   **Subjectivity and Definition:** Many commenters agree that "taste" is subjective and can be a useful hiring criterion, but warn that it can also be a form of narcissism where one's own preferences are presented as superior. A common definition offered is that good taste is writing code that appears deceptively simple.
*   **The "Broken Compass" Analogy:** A prominent thread expands on the article's "broken compass" analogy for engineers with bad taste. The consensus is that the truly dangerous engineer is not the obviously incompetent one, but the "partially broken compass" who appears competent but consistently makes subtly wrong decisions.
*   **Business Context is Crucial:** A major counterpoint is that discussions of taste often ignore the business and customer. The "baddest taste" can be building an overly complex solution for a problem that could be solved with a spreadsheet or a simple script. Exposure to real user feedback is seen as the best cure for poor taste.
*   **Pragmatism over Dogma:** The value of "simplicity" is debated, with some noting that it must be balanced against performance and other project requirements.
*   **Tangents:** The discussion inevitably veered into classic, low-stakes debates like "tabs vs. spaces," with a modern twist involving token efficiency for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## [California governor signs AI transparency bill into law](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/)
**Score:** 315 | **Comments:** 221 | **ID:** 45418428

> **Article:** California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 53 (SB 53) into law, establishing a regulatory framework for "frontier" AI developers. The law aims to balance safety and innovation by requiring large AI companies to publish transparency frameworks detailing their safety standards, creating a public computing consortium (CalCompute), establishing a mechanism for reporting critical safety incidents, and protecting whistleblowers. The legislation also includes civil penalties for non-compliance, enforceable by the Attorney General, and directs the Department of Technology to review the law annually.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical and skeptical of the new law. Key points of contention include:

*   **Weakness and Loopholes:** Many commenters argue the bill is "watered down" and that the financial penalties (capped at $10 million) are insignificant compared to the potential profits, offering little incentive for compliance.
*   **Vague Definitions:** A major critique is the broad and ambiguous definition of an "AI model," which some argue could technically encompass everything from a simple thermostat to a lawnmower, making the law impractical or overly broad.
*   **First Amendment Concerns:** One highly upvoted thread argues the law constitutes "censorship" and "prior restraint" by compelling companies to filter outputs based on government-defined "dangerous capabilities," potentially violating the First Amendment.
*   **Missed Issues:** Several users point out that the law fails to address the most pressing real-world issues, such as copyright infringement (the "theft" of training data) and IP protection.
*   **Industry Influence:** Skepticism was voiced that the law will simply create a lucrative new industry for consultants and auditors to certify compliance, rather than ensuring genuine safety.
*   **Federal Preemption:** Some commenters believe that a patchwork of state laws is inefficient and that these issues should be handled by comprehensive federal regulation.

**Score:** 309 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 45412098

> **Article:** The article announces the release of DeepSeek-v3.2-Exp, an experimental version of the DeepSeek model. The key technical innovation is "Deep Sparse Attention," which is highlighted as being particularly effective for code reasoning and handling long files. The release is also notable for a significant price drop of 50% for its API, making it even more cost-effective.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, focusing on three main themes:

1.  **Cost and Value:** Commenters are highly impressed by the combination of high performance and a 50% price reduction. There is a broader conversation about the rapid "price deflation" in the AI industry, with one user citing a study that inference costs for the same intelligence have dropped 10x per year. The consensus is that falling costs are as important as rising intelligence for the widespread adoption of AI.

2.  **Technical Innovation:** The use of "Deep Sparse Attention" in a real-world, large-scale model is praised, with speculation that it will be especially beneficial for programming tasks.

3.  **Industry Context:** Users compare DeepSeek favorably to Meta's Llama models, which some feel have stagnated. There is also discussion about the competitive landscape, noting that hardware-specific solutions are less critical while models evolve so quickly. A minor point of debate was cleared up regarding whether the model supports caching (it does), which is crucial for the low-cost agent workflows.

## [EA Announces Agreement to be Acquired by PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners](https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx)
**Score:** 294 | **Comments:** 436 | **ID:** 45413083

> **Article:** Electronic Arts (EA), the video game publisher, has announced an agreement to be acquired by a consortium of investors for $55 billion. The consortium consists of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), private equity firm Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners, a firm led by Jared Kushner. The deal will take EA private.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly negative and cynical, focusing on three main themes:

1.  **The Acquirers:** Users identify the buyers as Saudi Arabia's PIF, private equity, and Jared Kushner. There is significant distrust towards these entities, with users labeling them "vultures" and speculating that the deal is part of Saudi "sportswashing."
2.  **EA's Reputation:** Many commenters reflect on EA's decline, contrasting its current reputation for microtransactions and corporate greed with its past as a "good guy" and a haven for "software artists." Some express apathy, stating they no longer care about the company or its legacy IP (like SimCity and Command & Conquer).
3.  **Future Outlook:** There is a strong consensus that the acquisition will be bad for consumers. Users predict that microtransaction and "slot machine" mechanics will be intensified, not reduced. The deal is seen as the "final stage" for studios like Bioware and a move towards "AI slop games." While one user expressed a theoretical hope that going private could reduce the pressure for constant growth, others immediately countered that private equity's need to service debt will only accelerate the focus on profit.

## [iRobot Founder: Don't Believe the AI and Robotics Hype](https://crazystupidtech.com/2025/09/29/irobot-founder-dont-believe-the-ai-robotics-hype/)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 192 | **ID:** 45418261

> **Article:** The article features an interview with Rodney Brooks, co-founder of iRobot and Rethink Robotics. Brooks expresses skepticism about the current hype surrounding AI and humanoid robots, arguing that the technology is over-promising and under-delivering. He contrasts the "sexy" but impractical vision of general-purpose humanoid robots with the reality of "simple intelligence" that solves specific, reliable tasks. Brooks advocates for building practical, useful robots (like Roomba) that don't try to mimic human form or capabilities too closely, as the physical appearance of a robot sets expectations that complex humanoids cannot yet meet. He also discusses his difficulty in raising money for his new venture because it focuses on unsexy, practical automation rather than the hype-driven humanoid market.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is divided but largely critical of the humanoid robot hype, aligning with Brooks' skepticism. Key points include:

*   **Investor Logic vs. Reality:** Commenters debate whether investors should trust Brooks' track record (two successful robotics startups) despite his "unsexy" ideas, noting that previous success is a strong predictor in funding markets.
*   **Critique of Humanoids:** Many agree with Brooks that humanoids are inefficient and over-promising. Users point out that iRobot was crushed by cheaper Chinese competitors and that specialized robots (like warehouse carts) are already solving problems without needing a human form.
*   **The "Promise" of Form Factors:** A sub-thread debates Brooks' quote about how a human form promises human-like capability (and thus sets unrealistic expectations). Some argue humanoids are necessary because we built the world for humans, while others mock the over-promising nature of both robots and LLMs.
*   **Practicality vs. Hype:** Several comments emphasize that "simple intelligence" (reliable, task-specific automation) is what actually works and is needed in sectors like construction and agriculture, rather than general-purpose AGI-driven humanoids.
*   **Cost and Competition:** Users note that while hardware is getting cheaper (e.g., Unitree G1), the total cost remains high, and US companies face immense manufacturing cost competition from China.
*   **Real-world Failures:** Anecdotes about Uber drivers relying solely on GPS without situational awareness were used to illustrate the gap between automated systems and human adaptability.

## [Google appears to have deleted its political ad archive for the EU](https://www.thebriefing.ie/google-just-erased-7-years-of-our-political-history/)
**Score:** 255 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 45411332

> **Article:** An article from "The Briefing" reports that Google has deleted its political ad archive for the European Union. The archive, which had been maintained for approximately seven years, previously allowed public scrutiny of political advertising, including who paid for ads, how much they spent, and who was targeted. The deletion of this historical data is presented as a significant loss for transparency, accountability, and the "shared memory" of political events.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multi-faceted debate on the issue. Key points include:

*   **Corporate Responsibility vs. Public Duty:** A central conflict is whether a private company like Google has an obligation to indefinitely maintain a public record of political advertising. Some argue that companies are not archives and that this responsibility should fall to governments. Others counter that platforms profiting from political ads have a special duty to ensure transparency.
*   **Motivation for Deletion:** Commenters speculate on Google's motives. The most cited theory is that the deletion is a preemptive move to comply with new, stricter EU transparency regulations, avoiding potential fines or negative publicity from old, non-compliant ads.
*   **User and Institutional Failure:** Several users place blame on the data's users (researchers, archivists, journalists) for failing to create their own backups of critical information, arguing that relying on a corporation's goodwill is naive.
*   **The Role of Archivists:** A professional archivist chimes in to clarify that their role is precisely to preserve such data, as corporations are not reliable long-term stewards of the digital commons.
*   **Technical Solutions:** A practical point is raised that the data may not be immediately lost, with a suggestion that it might still be accessible via Google's BigQuery public datasets for a short period, prompting calls for archiving efforts.

## [A simple habit that saves my evenings](https://alikhil.dev/posts/the-simple-habit-that-saves-my-evenings/)
**Score:** 253 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 45412870

> **Article:** The article "A simple habit that saves my evenings" proposes a strategy to avoid burnout and improve next-day productivity. The core problem is the feeling of needing to finish a task before leaving for the day, which often leads to overtime. The author's solution is to stop working 20 minutes before the end of the day. Instead of trying to rush to completion, this time should be used to write down a step-by-step action plan for the next day. This creates a "clean break," allows for rest, and leverages the Zeigarnik effect (the motivational power of an open loop) to make starting the next morning easier and more efficient.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was largely supportive of the article's core idea, with many commenters sharing similar personal strategies. Key points of agreement included:
*   **Context Retention:** Multiple users highlighted that leaving a task half-finished is a powerful way to preserve mental context, making it much faster to "get into the zone" the next day. This was compared to Ernest Hemingway's writing technique of stopping when you know what comes next.
*   **Shutdown Rituals:** The habit was compared to Cal Newport's concept of a "shutdown ritual," which helps create a clear boundary between work and personal time.
*   **Psychological Benefits:** Commenters noted that this method helps get out of "ruts" by preventing the daily need to re-establish context and provides a feeling of control.

However, there were also points of disagreement and nuance:
*   **Practical Challenges:** Some users argued that it's difficult to capture the full complexity of one's thoughts in a simple plan. One commenter, whose job was "toxic" and had constant interruptions, found the habit impossible to implement in their environment.
*   **Skepticism:** A few cynical comments dismissed the advice as trivial ("discovered clocking out and going home").
*   **Counter-arguments:** One user questioned how this helps if the primary problem is constant interruptions throughout the day, not just at the end.

Overall, the community validated the article's premise, with the most insightful comments focusing on the practical benefits of managing cognitive context and the psychological need for a clear end to the workday.

## [FCC Accidentally Leaked iPhone Schematics](https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/fcc-accidentally-leaked-iphone-schematics-potentially-giving-rivals-a-peek-at-company-secrets-154551807.html)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 45416231

> **Article:** The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accidentally leaked confidential schematics for an unannounced iPhone model (identified as the "iPhone 16e") on its public website. The leak occurred when the FCC failed to redact proprietary information from documents submitted by Apple for regulatory approval. The schematics provide a detailed look at the phone's internal components, including the logic board layout, antenna design, and other hardware elements.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the implications of the leak, with commenters debating its significance and the FCC's responsibility. Key points include:

*   **Impact on Apple and Competitors:** Most users argued that the leak poses little threat to Apple. Competitors like Samsung and Chinese manufacturers already possess the expertise to design smartphones, and the core value of the iPhone lies in its proprietary chips and software, not the publicly visible PCB layout. Some suggested the leak might be more useful for the Chinese "shadow industry" of repair shops and cloners.
*   **Right to Repair:** A major theme was support for the leak as a victory for the right-to-repair movement. Commenters argued that such schematics should be a mandatory part of FCC certification to empower independent repair technicians, even if they aren't revolutionary for advanced diagnostics.
*   **Legal and Governmental Ramifications:** Users debated whether Apple could sue the FCC. The consensus was that it's highly unlikely, as the government doesn't sign NDAs and proving significant damages would be difficult.
*   **Technical Analysis:** Some users noted that while the schematics show the complexity of RF noise suppression, modern PCBs are largely "boring" and the real innovation is in the custom silicon and firmware, which remain secret.
*   **Skepticism and Context:** The discussion included skepticism about the leak's accidental nature, with some users referencing Apple's contentious history with the FCC. Others pointed out the original source of the story and provided a direct link to the leaked PDF.

## [Write the damn code](https://antonz.org/write-code/)
**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 45415232

> **Article:** The article "Write the damn code" argues against using AI as a "software factory"—giving it a high-level prompt and iterating on the output. The author contends that this approach is a waste of time because programming is fundamentally a specification problem, and shifting the specification from a formal programming language to a natural language prompt doesn't solve the core challenge. The article advocates for developers to remain deeply engaged in the coding process, using AI as a tool to assist, not as a replacement for their own understanding and craftsmanship.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but offers a nuanced view on the effective use of AI in programming. The consensus is that AI is a powerful assistant, not an autonomous developer.

Key points from the discussion include:
*   **AI as a "Pairing Buddy":** Many developers find success using AI as an intelligent assistant for tasks like API lookups, generating boilerplate, refactoring, and providing examples in unfamiliar languages or frameworks. This keeps the developer in control of architecture and quality.
*   **The Problem of "AI Factory" Workflow:** Users confirm that repeatedly prompting an AI to fix code is inefficient and leads to a loss of understanding. One user notes the paradox that when AI writes most of the code, the developer has to work harder to understand it.
*   **Cognitive Overhead and Disengagement:** Some developers find AI autocomplete distracting and disabling it helps them think more clearly and engage more deeply with the code.
*   **The Human Factor:** A significant counterpoint highlights a social/team problem: AI can enable less diligent teammates to generate unreviewed, low-quality code, shifting the maintenance burden onto experts. This can lead to burnout and team dysfunction.
*   **Learning and Ownership:** A recurring theme is that writing the code is essential to truly understanding a problem and its edge cases. Over-reliance on AI can lead to a superficial understanding of the system.

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub repository titled "OS from scratch," which provides a tutorial for creating a simple operating system. The author has marked the project as "old, abandoned" and advises users to look for more modern sources for learning OS design. The tutorial is focused on legacy x86 architecture.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion offers a critical perspective on the tutorial. While some commenters find it a straightforward and fun example of legacy x86 programming, the prevailing opinion is that it is an outdated resource that teaches obsolete practices. Users are advised against following it to learn modern OS development, as it only results in a simple "hello world" style OS for emulation. Instead, commenters recommend more relevant alternatives, such as using RISC-V, studying the Stanford CS140E course (bare metal on Raspberry Pi), or consulting the OSDev.org wiki. A separate thread discusses the challenge of porting very old Linux versions to modern toolchains. Several users also reflect on how OS concepts like scheduling and caching reappear in distributed systems engineering.

## [The history of cataract surgery](https://www.asimov.press/p/cataracts)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 138 | **ID:** 45414718

> **Article:** The article traces the 4,000-year history of cataract surgery, from ancient "couching" methods (dislocating the lens with a thorn or needle) to modern phacoemulsification (using ultrasound to break up the lens) and laser-assisted techniques. It highlights the revolutionary introduction of Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) in the 20th century, which replaced the need for thick glasses after surgery. The piece notes that modern cataract surgery is now a highly successful, 20-minute outpatient procedure with a 95% success rate, making it the most common surgery worldwide and a major factor in extending human healthspan.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mix of appreciation for modern medicine and scrutiny of the article's claims. Key points include:

*   **Skepticism of Statistics:** Several users questioned the "95% success rate," noting that a 5% failure rate for an eye surgery sounds alarming. One user attempted to trace the citation but found the source unclear, suggesting the statistic might be misleading without context on what constitutes "failure."
*   **Personal Experiences:** Multiple users shared positive stories of family members whose vision was dramatically restored, describing the emotional impact. Others noted the psychological adjustment, such as seeing wrinkles clearly again or the brain compensating for the lens's slight yellow tint (which is intentionally matched to a younger person's lens).
*   **Technical and Medical Details:** A user who worked on IOL manufacturing provided technical insights, such as the intentional yellow tint of lenses and the higher complication rate for repeat surgeries. Another user provided a counter-perspective, arguing that despite its "modern" label, much of the surgery still relies on delicate manual dexterity, making the high success rate even more impressive.
*   **Critiques and Concerns:** Topics of debate included the commercialization of the procedure (upselling expensive lenses in countries like Canada and Sweden) and the focus on treatment over prevention (linking cataracts to metabolic diseases).
*   **Historical Context:** Users shared historical facts, such as the risk of eye surgery in Bach's time and the commonality of the procedure compared to others like C-sections or circumcision.
