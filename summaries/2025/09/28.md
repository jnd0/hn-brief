## [Privacy Badger is a free browser extension made by EFF to stop spying](https://privacybadger.org/)
**Score:** 849 | **Comments:** 334 | **ID:** 45404021

> **Article:** The article links to Privacy Badger, a free browser extension from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Its primary function is to automatically block invisible trackers that use your browsing behavior to track you across different websites. Unlike traditional ad blockers, its philosophy is not to block all ads, but to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices by only blocking the ads that are also trackers. It learns and evolves as you browse, identifying and blocking new trackers as they appear.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on three main themes: the utility of Privacy Badger in the age of uBlock Origin, its underlying philosophy, and the nature of online privacy.

1.  **Redundancy vs. uBlock Origin:** A significant portion of the debate questions whether Privacy Badger is still necessary. Many users and a referenced guide (arkenfox) argue that uBlock Origin, especially with default filter lists, already blocks trackers and ads effectively, making Privacy Badger redundant. However, some users advocate for using both as a "good lightweight combination," and a developer of Privacy Badger chimes in to defend its unique, learning-based approach.

2.  **Advertising Philosophy:** A highly upvoted comment thread strongly agrees with Privacy Badger's goal of promoting "context-sensitive" advertising (ads relevant to the page you're on) over "personalized ads" (based on your history). Users express frustration with irrelevant, history-based ads (e.g., car ads after you've already bought a car) and plead for platforms like YouTube to adopt a more contextual model.

3.  **Privacy vs. Uniqueness:** A counter-argument is raised that any browser extension, including ad and tracker blockers, can make a user more unique and thus easier to fingerprint. The counter-argument to this is that if an extension is widely adopted, this effect is mitigated. The consensus is that for ultimate anonymity, the Tor Browser is the superior tool.

4.  **Technical Nuances:** Users discuss the practicalities, such as Privacy Badger's ability to block tracking cookies from services like Google Fonts while still allowing the fonts themselves to load, a feature uBlock Origin doesn't offer in the same way. There are also notes on browser compatibility, with Privacy Badger having limitations on Safari and mobile platforms.

## [The AI coding trap](https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/09/28/the-ai-coding-trap)
**Score:** 685 | **Comments:** 409 | **ID:** 45405177

> **Article:** The article "The AI coding trap" argues that developers fall into a trap by using AI coding assistants as "junior developers" to generate code immediately for simple tasks. This leads to a cycle where the AI produces a large volume of code that is often "brittle, generic, and disconnected from the actual problem," creating significant technical debt. The author contends that this misuse stems from treating AI as a coding replacement rather than a tool. The "trap" is that developers are left with the "thankless tasks" of testing, refactoring, and documenting this AI-generated code, while the AI gets the "fun" part of writing new features. The article advocates for a more disciplined approach, using AI for specific, well-defined tasks but keeping the human in control of architecture, design, and high-level planning.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely pushes back on the article's premise, with many experienced developers arguing that the "trap" is a result of poor usage, not an inherent flaw of the tools. The key points are:

*   **Planning is Crucial:** Commenters, led by `tptacek`, argue that skilled engineers use AI for planning and design, often starting with prompts like "DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE YET." They use AI to execute a well-thought-out plan, not to generate one. This process itself creates valuable design documentation.
*   **AI is a Tool, Not a Junior Dev:** The consensus is that the "AI as a junior" analogy is flawed. The user is the one learning and improving their prompting and architectural skills, creating a compounding value loop.
*   **AI is Good for "Thankless Tasks":** Several users (`abrichr`, `kevin42`) directly contradict the author's claim that AI leaves humans with all the grunt work. They find AI highly effective for scaffolding, writing tests, generating documentation, and setting up infrastructure.
*   **Context Engineering is Key:** The failure mode isn't the AI, but a lack of context. Users recommend providing the AI with extensive context about architecture, business logic, and roadmaps (e.g., using "memory banks") to get better results.
*   **The "Doer" vs. "Thinker" Divide:** One commenter (`shredprez`) reframes the debate as a divide between people who enjoy the "doing" (typing, fiddling) versus the "thinking" (architecting, planning). AI empowers the latter.
*   **Future Outlook:** A more extreme view (`dkural`) suggests that the entire human role in the coding stack will eventually be eliminated, making the current debate about best practices moot.

## [When I say “alphabetical order”, I mean “alphabetical order”](https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-09-28-alphabetic-order/)
**Score:** 594 | **Comments:** 367 | **ID:** 45404022

> **Article:** The article, titled "When I say 'alphabetical order', I mean 'alphabetical order'", argues that modern file browsers and operating systems have abandoned true alphabetical sorting in favor of a "natural sort" (also known as "alphanumeric" or "version" sort). The author demonstrates that under this system, a file named "file_9.txt" is sorted *after* "file_10.txt" because the number 9 is treated as being less than 10. The author contends that this behavior is a bug, not a feature, because it violates the principle of lexicographical order where characters are compared one by one based on their code points. They express frustration that this "magical" sorting is imposed by default without an option to revert to a strict, predictable alphabetical sort.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a clear divide between user expectations and developer preferences. The consensus is that the behavior described by the author (natural sort) is overwhelmingly more useful and intuitive for the vast majority of users, especially when dealing with numbered files, photos, or software versions. However, many commenters agree with the author's core point that the issue is one of *labeling* and *control*. They argue that the feature should be clearly named (e.g., "Natural Sort" or "Alphanumeric Sort") rather than being the default behavior for a "Name" sort, and that users should have the option to switch to a strict alphabetical sort for cases where it's needed. The discussion also touches on alternative sorting methods (e.g., by creation date) and acknowledges that this is a long-standing, solved problem with established APIs in operating systems like macOS and Windows.

## [We bought the whole GPU, so we're damn well going to use the whole GPU](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-09-28-tp-llama-main)
**Score:** 504 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 45407953

> **Article:** The article, from the Hazy Research group at Stanford, argues that AI researchers are not fully utilizing the capabilities of modern GPUs. They present a case study of optimizing a Llama 2 model, demonstrating significant performance gains by moving beyond standard high-level libraries (like PyTorch) and writing custom CUDA kernels. Their approach focuses on maximizing the use of the entire GPU, including utilizing Tensor Cores, managing memory hierarchies (registers, shared memory, L2 cache) efficiently, and overlapping computation with memory transfers. The result is a highly specialized, performant implementation that they acknowledge is brittle and not intended for general use, but serves as a proof-of-concept for what's possible when developers take full control of the hardware.

**Score:** 347 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 45406109

> **Article:** The article links to the full PDF of "Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition" (2013) by Andrew Gelman et al., a standard graduate-level textbook on Bayesian statistics. The book is known for its rigorous, practical approach to modeling and is widely considered a foundational text in the field.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the book's reputation as a rigorous but advanced text, leading to extensive recommendations for alternative learning resources tailored to different experience levels.

Key points include:
*   **Book's Status:** BDA3 is praised as "THE book" for in-depth, rigorous Bayesian modeling, but is considered too daunting for beginners. It is recommended for those with a prior background in statistics.
*   **Alternative Recommendations:** For those seeking a more approachable entry point, the most frequent recommendations are:
    *   **Statistical Rethinking** by Richard McElreath: Praised for teaching a "how to think about modeling" philosophy and being more intuitive. The author's free video lectures are also highly recommended.
    *   **Regression and Other Stories** by Gelman et al.: A more accessible text on similar topics.
    *   **Bayesian Methods for Hackers** and **Think Bayes**: Recommended for programmers coming from a CS background.
*   **Practical Application:** A user shared a success story using Bayesian methods for a sampling problem, but noted reluctance from other engineers to learn the techniques, sparking a debate on the division of labor between engineers and data scientists.
*   **Relevance:** Users affirmed that Bayesian methods remain relevant even in the era of big data and foundation models, particularly for problems with limited data or for using techniques like variational inference with neural networks.

## [Go ahead, write the “stupid” code](https://spikepuppet.io/posts/write-the-stupid-code/)
**Score:** 242 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 45408617

> **Article:** The article "Go ahead, write the 'stupid' code" advocates for a pragmatic approach to programming, encouraging developers to write simple, direct, and "stupid" code first rather than striving for premature optimization or overly clever architecture. The author argues that this approach leads to getting things done faster and that code can be refactored and optimized later if necessary. The piece contrasts this with the common pressure to write "smart" or complex code, suggesting that simple, working code is often more valuable and maintainable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, framing it as a practical and effective development strategy. Key points include:

*   **Pragmatism and Iteration:** Many commenters share personal experiences of getting more done by writing simple code first and refactoring later, rather than getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
*   **The "Clever Code" Trap:** A recurring theme is that overly clever or complex code is difficult to debug. One commenter cites Kernighan's law ("debugging code is twice as hard as creating it") to argue that if you write code at the limit of your cleverness, you won't be able to maintain it.
*   **Nuance and Caveats:** While the general sentiment is supportive, some users add nuance. One commenter argues that the "quantity over quality" photography study mentioned in the article only works because the students had a secure grade, allowing for experimentation. Another points out that truly "stupid" or terrible code does exist, and the article's title is a bit of an overstatement.
*   **Context Matters:** The discussion touches on the importance of context. One user shared a C++ example where a "stupid" loop was less performant than a SIMD-optimized version, but the consensus was that the simple code should be written first and the compiler (or a later manual optimization) should handle the performance.
*   **Learning and Maintenance:** Commenters also highlighted that writing simple code is crucial for collaborative projects and for one's own future self, as maintaining "clever" code is a significant burden.

## [EPA tells some scientists to stop publishing studies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/09/20/epa-scientists-research-publications/)
**Score:** 213 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 45403656

> **Article:** An article from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reports that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is planning to eliminate its Office of Research and Development (ORD), which conducts and oversees the agency's scientific research. This move, part of a broader reorganization, is seen by critics as a way to dismantle scientific functions that could challenge the administration's pro-industry, anti-regulation agenda. The article cites anonymous staff who claim their research has been paused, though the EPA officially denies this, attributing delays to the reorganization. The piece frames this as a potential "backdoor" way to bury science without an official gag order, raising concerns about the future of evidence-based policy at the agency.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the EPA's plan and the current administration's approach to science and environmental policy. Key points include:
*   **Distrust of the Administration:** Many commenters express deep distrust in the EPA leadership and the White House, citing a long history of lies and a stated goal of dismantling environmental protections. They view the "reorganization" as a deliberate effort to suppress inconvenient science.
*   **Political Polarization:** While some lament the politicization of science, others argue that one party is uniquely hostile to scientific findings, particularly on climate change. The debate touches on whether this is a result of political polarization or a fundamentally anti-science ideology.
*   **Systemic Concerns:** Commenters discuss the potential for a "brain drain" of scientists leaving the country, the danger of a government that ignores evidence, and the need for independent, non-governmental organizations to advance scientific and environmental goals.
*   **Psychology of Anti-Science Beliefs:** Some users try to understand the motivation behind supporting policies that harm the environment and public health, questioning the logic of "clean coal" and rejecting scientific consensus.

## [Scm2wasm: A Scheme to WASM compiler in 600 lines of C, making use of WASM GC](https://git.lain.faith/iitalics/scm2wasm)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 45405175

> **Article:** The article links to a project named "Scm2wasm," a compiler that translates a subset of the Scheme programming language into WebAssembly (WASM). The project is notable for being implemented in just 600 lines of C and for leveraging the new WebAssembly Garbage Collection (GC) feature to manage memory, avoiding the need for a manual memory allocator.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focuses on comparing Scm2wasm to other projects and assessing its completeness. Key points include:

*   **Completeness:** Commenters note that Scm2wasm is not a full, standards-conforming Scheme implementation, as it currently lacks essential features like `read` and `eval`, which would be necessary for creating a REPL.
*   **Alternative Projects:** Several users point to "Guile Hoot," a more mature Scheme-to-WASM compiler written in Scheme, as a related and more feature-complete alternative.
*   **Technical Features:** It's clarified that the compiler supports tail-call optimization by using a corresponding WebAssembly feature, but it does not yet support `call/cc` (continuations).
*   **Broader Context:** The conversation expands to include other WASM-related projects, such as hand-written WASM runtimes and educational resources for compilers targeting WASM.
*   **Platform:** A side discussion praises the project for being hosted on a self-hosted forge, with users mentioning alternatives like Radicle.

## [The Demon-Haunted World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 45404373

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia page for "The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark," a 1995 book by Carl Sagan. The book is a defense of scientific rationalism and a critique of pseudoscience, superstition, and religious dogma. It argues for the importance of the scientific method as a tool for distinguishing reality from fantasy. A central concept is the "dragon in the garage" analogy, which posits that a claim that is unfalsifiable (e.g., an invisible, intangible dragon) is functionally equivalent to no claim at all, as there is no evidence that could ever disprove it. The book also famously contains Sagan's "pale blue dot" passage, which uses the image of Earth from space to argue for humility, global unity, and the preservation of our only planet.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users sharing personal anecdotes about how the book influenced them. Key themes include:

*   **Sagan's Legacy and Style:** Commenters praise Sagan's eloquent and humble writing style, contrasting it favorably with the more confrontational approach of other prominent atheists like Richard Dawkins. There is a sense that Sagan's compassion made his message more effective.
*   **The "Pale Blue Dot" Speech:** This passage is highlighted as a profoundly moving and poetic piece of writing. However, one commenter offers a dissenting view, arguing that the speech is contradictory, as it dismisses humanity's importance while simultaneously acknowledging Earth's unique status as the only known harbor of life.
*   **The "Dragon in the Garage" Analogy:** This is frequently cited as a core takeaway, used to illustrate the problem with unfalsifiable claims, such as those concerning the afterlife or the soul.
*   **Self-Reflection vs. Judgment:** A significant point of debate is whether the book's lessons should be applied to oneself or to others. Several users argue that the true value of skepticism is in examining one's own beliefs and "wrong stories," rather than using it as a weapon to judge or "fix" others. They warn against the arrogance of assuming one's own worldview is infallible.
*   **Sagan's Critique of Skeptics:** One user points out that Sagan was critical of the skeptical movement itself, warning against a condescending "Us vs. Them" mentality and advocating for a more compassionate approach.
*   **Modern Relevance:** Many commenters feel Sagan's warnings about a society losing its critical faculties and sliding back into superstition have become a reality, citing the rise of misinformation and conspiracy theories.
*   **The Nature of Consciousness:** A side thread touches on neuroscience, with one user suggesting our brains generate stories to rationalize actions driven by subconscious processes, linking this to the book's themes of self-deception.

## [A human-accelerated neuron type potentially underlying autism in humans](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/42/9/msaf189/8245036?login=false)
**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 45408994

> **Article:** The research paper proposes that the high prevalence of autism in humans may be an evolutionary byproduct of selection for human-specific intelligence. The authors identify a "human-accelerated" neuron type (likely a specific subtype of GABAergic interneuron) that evolved to support complex human cognition. However, this evolutionary change also made these neurons more sensitive to genetic and environmental disruptions. The paper argues that the genetic shifts enabling human brain evolution inadvertently created a vulnerability to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), framing neurodiversity as an inextricable trade-off for the cognitive advantages that define humanity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on clarifying the paper's scope and exploring the nature of intelligence. A central theme was distinguishing between two interpretations of the study: it argues that autism is a byproduct of *human evolution*, not that high intelligence in an individual correlates with autism. Users debated whether there is a trade-off between social and general intelligence, citing historical figures like Einstein and Newton. Other topics included the limits of intelligence (referencing Kolmogorov complexity), the lack of reliable biological tests for autism, and anecdotal evidence of neurodivergence in families. The discussion also featured a moderation intervention against a political tangent and a humorous analogy to Dragon Ball Z.

## [Ask HN: What is nowadays (opensource) way of converting HTML to PDF?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45404760)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 165 | **ID:** 45404760

> **Question:** The user asks the Hacker News community for the current open-source standard for converting HTML to PDF. They are looking for modern, reliable solutions for this common technical task.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on two main approaches: using headless browsers (specifically Chromium) and dedicated HTML-to-PDF libraries.

The most recommended solutions are:
*   **Headless Browser Automation:** Tools like **Puppeteer**, **Playwright**, and **Gotenberg** (a Dockerized API for Chromium) are the most popular suggestions. They are praised for their reliability and ability to render modern, JavaScript-heavy pages accurately. The key to success with this method is writing proper print CSS for pagination.
*   **Dedicated Libraries:** **WeasyPrint** is the leading non-browser-based open-source option, valued for its CSS support and Python integration. It's a strong choice for server-side rendering where a full browser engine might be overkill. Other tools like the older `wkhtmltopdf` are mentioned but generally discouraged as outdated.

A key theme is that the quality of the output depends heavily on the input's CSS. Users emphasized the need for specific print CSS properties (like `break-after: page`) to control pagination.

Alternative suggestions included:
*   **Manual Approach:** Simply using the browser's "Print to PDF" function, though this is only practical for user-initiated, one-off tasks.
*   **Archiving:** For non-printing purposes, the **SingleFile** extension was suggested as a better way to archive web pages.

## [Solar panels + cold = A potential problem](https://www.linspyre.com/ecoholics/temps.html)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 218 | **ID:** 45401051

> **Article:** The article explains a potential problem for consumers using portable power stations (like the EcoFlow Delta Pro) with solar panels in cold weather. Solar panels become more efficient at lower temperatures, which causes their output voltage to increase. A setup that is safe in warm conditions (e.g., 148V) can exceed the device's maximum input voltage (150V) on a cold, sunny day, potentially damaging the power station's internal components. The author warns that consumers who calculate their panel configuration based on standard temperature ratings are at risk and suggests they may need to undersize their setup to account for this voltage increase.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on whether this issue is a user error or a product design flaw. The consensus is that while the physics of voltage increasing in cold temperatures is correct and explained by MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) technology, the product's handling of this is poor.

Key points of debate include:
*   **Product Design Flaw:** Many commenters argue the manufacturer is at fault for not including adequate safety features like fuses, crowbar circuits, or software limits to prevent overvoltage. They criticize the company for using the "absolute maximum" component rating as the "recommended maximum" in its documentation, leaving no safety margin.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Commenters heavily criticize the manufacturer for blaming customers instead of providing a better solution. The lack of clear guidance (e.g., "max 2 panels in series") and the expectation for consumers to understand temperature coefficients is seen as a failure of product design.
*   **Analogies and Comparisons:** The article's gasoline/diesel analogy was widely panned as poor. A better comparison was made to electrical codes for ovens, where the label must accurately reflect the required safety margins.
*   **Technical Solutions:** Some discussed technical fixes, such as adding a simple microcontroller-based circuit to cut off power before the voltage limit is reached.
*   **Industry Context:** The discussion also touched on the "magic smoke" trope (electronics failing catastrophically) and the importance of understanding the entire electrical system for software engineers working on hardware projects.

## [The Weird Concept of Branchless Programming](https://sanixdk.xyz/blogs/the-weird-concept-of-branchless-programming)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 45405750

> **Article:** The article "The Weird Concept of Branchless Programming" introduces the technique of writing code without conditional branches (like `if` statements) to improve performance. It explains that modern CPUs use pipelining, and a branch misprediction can cause a significant performance penalty as the pipeline has to be flushed. The article provides three examples: calculating the absolute value of a number, clamping a number within a range, and partitioning an array. For each, it shows a traditional "branchy" implementation and a "branchless" alternative using bitwise operations or arithmetic tricks, and presents benchmarks suggesting the branchless versions are faster.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is highly critical of the article's benchmarks and conclusions. The central theme is that the author's performance claims are not well-supported by their evidence.

Key points of the discussion include:
*   **Flawed Benchmarking:** Multiple users point out that the article's benchmarks are unreliable due to low precision (e.g., "~5ms") and likely insufficient iterations. One user reran the tests with more iterations and found that the branchless versions were actually *slower* in most cases with compiler optimizations enabled.
*   **Modern CPUs are Good at Branching:** Commenters note that modern CPUs have highly effective branch predictors, which often mitigate the penalty of branching, making simple branchless optimizations less impactful than they might have been on older hardware.
*   **Valid Use Cases for Branchless Programming:** While the article's examples were deemed unimpressive, the community highlighted more compelling use cases:
    *   **Cryptography:** To prevent timing attacks, where branches could leak information about secret keys.
    *   **Data-Dependent Branches:** For operations where the branch direction is random and unpredictable (e.g., CRC checksums), as branch predictors fail in these scenarios.
    *   **SIMD/Vectorization:** Branchless code is often necessary for effective compiler auto-vectorization.
*   **Code Quality and Safety:** A side discussion focused on the risks of writing tricky bit-manipulation code, including potential undefined behavior in C/C++ and the difficulty of maintaining such code. Some mentioned that languages like Rust, with tools like Miri, can help catch these issues.

In summary, the community found the article's examples and benchmarks to be weak, but used the topic to discuss the real-world trade-offs, valid applications, and modern context of branchless programming.

> **Article:** The linked Freakonomics podcast episode argues that the United States is primarily run by lawyers, while China is run by engineers. The premise suggests that China's leadership, with its technical background, focuses on practical, long-term problem-solving and infrastructure, whereas the US leadership, dominated by legal expertise, is more focused on process, debate, litigation, and adversarial frameworks, potentially hindering decisive action and progress on complex issues.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a multifaceted critique and expansion of the article's premise. Key points include:

*   **Critique of the Premise:** Several users argue that China is not run by engineers but is an authoritarian state controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping. However, others counter that many high-ranking CCP members do have engineering backgrounds, which influences policy priorities (e.g., pushing tech companies towards "deeptech").

*   **Alternative US Problems:** Many commenters shift the focus away from lawyers, identifying other issues in US governance:
    *   **Age:** A significant thread argues the primary problem is the extreme age of US politicians, citing figures like Chuck Grassley.
    *   **Political Machines:** The Democratic party is criticized for a system that rewards loyalty over competence, preventing dynamic leadership.
    *   **Financialization & Corporations:** Some argue the real power lies with accountants and lawyers within corporations, which control the government, leading to the decline of engineering-focused companies like Boeing.
    *   **Entertainment & Personality:** A recurring view is that the US is currently run by "entertainers," "influencers," or "failed reality TV stars," not just lawyers.

*   **Skepticism & Meta-Commentary:** The source, Freakonomics, is described by one user as "laundering conservative talking-points" for a mainstream audience, while another notes that conservatives see it as a "democratic mouthpiece," suggesting it occupies a contested middle ground. The general sentiment is that the US could learn from other systems but is culturally resistant to doing so.
