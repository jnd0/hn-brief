# Hacker News Summary - 2025-09-18

## [Slack has raised our charges by $195k per year](https://skyfall.dev/posts/slack)
**Score:** 3406 | **Comments:** 1470 | **ID:** 45283887

> **Article:** The article, from the perspective of Hack Club (a non-profit), details how Slack abruptly increased their annual charges from $5,000 to $200,000. This represents a 40x price hike after a previous "special deal" expired. The author expresses shock at the suddenness and magnitude of the increase, noting they were given only a week to decide before their data would be deleted. The post serves as a warning about the risks of relying on large SaaS providers who can change pricing terms at will.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction focused on several key themes:

*   **Distrust of SaaS and "Vendor Lock-in":** Many commenters used this as an example of why companies should not rely on large cloud providers. The consensus was that this is a classic "bait and switch" tactic: get users hooked on a service, embed it into their workflow, and then dramatically raise prices once switching costs become too high.
*   **Alternatives to Slack:** Users suggested self-hostable, open-source alternatives like **Mattermost** and **Zulip**. However, there was some debate about whether these were truly better long-term solutions or if they might eventually face similar issues.
*   **Criticism of Slack/Salesforce:** Commenters criticized the business practice as predatory, particularly given Hack Club's non-profit status. There was speculation that this pricing strategy is a result of Slack's acquisition by Salesforce.
*   **The "Cloud vs. Self-Hosting" Debate:** The discussion broadened into a general argument for owning your own infrastructure ("own your shit") versus the convenience of cloud services. One commenter shared a counter-anecdote about a company that switched *from* self-hosted tools *to* cloud services due to perceived ease of use and "cool factor," highlighting the difficulty of convincing non-technical leadership to maintain in-house solutions.

## [Want to piss off your IT department? Are the links not malicious looking enough?](https://phishyurl.com/)
**Score:** 1127 | **Comments:** 320 | **ID:** 45295898

> **Article:** The article links to a tool called "Phishyurl.com," a website that generates URLs designed to look malicious to IT security systems. The URLs are long, contain suspicious keywords (like "inject," "spoof," "phish"), and mimic complex directory structures, but they do not actually lead to malicious sites. The purpose of the tool is humorous: to annoy IT departments by triggering false positives in security scanners and email filters.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reaction was a mix of amusement and caution. Most users found the tool funny and "chaotic neutral," with several sharing memories of similar defunct services like "shadyurl." Some users even posted generated links in the comments to demonstrate their "phishy" appearance.

However, a significant counter-discussion emerged regarding the practical impact on security. One user argued that generating false positives makes security systems noisier and increases the likelihood that real threats will be missed by exhausted IT teams. Others expanded on this, criticizing the current state of email security (e.g., Microsoft quarantining its own emails) and suggesting that the reliance on heuristic detection is fundamentally flawed. A minority raised a darker concern: that these domains could eventually be purchased by malicious actors and used for actual phishing campaigns.

## [Nvidia buys $5B in Intel](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal)
**Score:** 1018 | **Comments:** 616 | **ID:** 45288161

> **Article:** Nvidia has announced a strategic partnership with Intel, which includes a $5 billion investment to purchase Intel stock. The collaboration involves jointly developing Intel x86 System-on-Chips (SoCs) for PCs that integrate Nvidia's RTX graphics, as well as creating custom Nvidia data center x86 processors. This marks a significant shift from their historically competitive relationship.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is centered on the strategic implications, timing, and financial aspects of the deal. Key points include:

*   **Political Timing:** Many commenters believe the deal's timing is influenced by the current US administration's focus on domestic semiconductor manufacturing, suggesting it may be a move to appease regulators or the government.
*   **Market Power & Antitrust:** Users note the irony of former rivals partnering and speculate that this could be a precursor to a full acquisition of Intel by Nvidia, given Nvidia's massive market valuation makes it financially feasible. However, antitrust concerns would be a major hurdle.
*   **Strategic Motivations:** The partnership is seen as a way for Nvidia to secure access to Intel's manufacturing capacity (foundry) and gain a foothold in the x86 CPU market for its GPUs, potentially pressuring other partners like MediaTek.
*   **Financial Details:** There is significant discussion about whether the $5B is for newly issued (dilutive) stock or existing shares, with concern from some users about shareholder dilution.
*   **Impact on Intel:** Commenters debate whether Intel will continue its own GPU development (Arc). Some see this as a validation of unified CPU/GPU architectures, similar to Apple's and AMD's approaches.

## [KDE is now my favorite desktop](https://kokada.dev/blog/kde-is-now-my-favorite-desktop/)
**Score:** 892 | **Comments:** 742 | **ID:** 45288690

> **Article:** The author, a long-time GNOME user, details their positive experience switching to the KDE Plasma desktop environment. They highlight several key advantages that won them over, primarily KDE's extensive customizability and user-centric design philosophy. This includes granular control over UI elements, a more flexible and intuitive window management system (especially for tiling), and the availability of powerful built-in tools like the KWin window manager and KDE Connect for seamless phone-to-PC integration. The article frames KDE as a desktop that empowers the user with choice and control, contrasting it with the more rigid, opinionated defaults of other popular environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a divided but largely positive view of KDE Plasma, centered on the classic trade-off between stability/features and the "it just works" experience.

*   **Stability vs. Polish:** A primary point of contention is KDE's reliability. Some users echo the article's positivity, reporting smooth, issue-free experiences for months or years. However, a significant counter-argument, led by the top comment from `netbioserror`, is that KDE is prone to "little breakages" and "Qt dependency hell" over time, leading them to prefer more "bomb-proof" environments like Cinnamon (Linux Mint). The author of the article acknowledges this, admitting one week is not enough to encounter long-term issues.

*   **Historical Reputation:** The infamous KDE 4.0 release is mentioned as a source of the project's lasting bad reputation, though long-time users argue this is outdated and the project has long since matured.

*   **Specific Criticisms:** Users point to specific, recurring annoyances, such as visual flickering when switching windows (`abhinavk`) and confusing multi-monitor primary display behavior (`_davide_`).

*   **Counterpoints & Comparisons:** The discussion also includes praise for KDE's polish, with one user calling it a "serious upgrade" over macOS. Others compare it to minimalistic DEs like XFCE, which are criticized for lacking the deep application integration and polish of a full-featured suite like KDE.

*   **Community Engagement:** The author and a Plasma developer (`sho_hn`) actively participated in the discussion, clarifying points and engaging with feedback.

## [Meta Ray-Ban Display](https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-ray-ban-display-ai-glasses-connect-2025/)
**Score:** 639 | **Comments:** 962 | **ID:** 45283306

> **Article:** Meta announced the "Meta Ray-Ban Display" glasses, a new AI wearable set to be available on September 30th for $799. The product features a display integrated into the glasses and is controlled by an EMG (electromyography) wristband that reads nerve signals to allow for text input and navigation with minimal finger movement. The announcement highlights the ability to check messages, preview photos, and interact with Meta AI without needing to use a phone.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely skeptical and mixed. Many commenters feel the product is a solution in search of a problem, questioning the need for another gadget when a smartphone already exists. There is a recurring sentiment that the product lacks a "cool factor" and feels like a top-down marketing creation rather than an organic innovation.

Key points of contention include:
*   **Utility vs. Redundancy:** Users debate whether the glasses will actually reduce phone usage or just add another device to manage. Some compare it to a smartwatch, while others see it as unnecessary.
*   **The EMG Wristband:** The neural interface wristband generated the most interest, with one user calling the demo of typing with minimal finger movement a "WTF moment." However, others noted that the wrist accessory, rather than the glasses themselves, is the key piece of technology.
*   **Lack of Killer Apps:** A common critique is the absence of compelling software or "blockbuster apps" for AR, with *Pokémon Go* cited as the only major success in the space so far.
*   **Historical Context:** Skeptics drew parallels to past tech failures like the Phillips CD-i and noted that Meta has been promising similar "haptic" and neural interface tech for years without a finished product.
*   **Positive Outlook:** A minority of users defended the announcement, giving credit to Meta for its long-term investment in Reality Labs and viewing this as a promising first-generation product that will improve with future versions.

## [Show HN: The text disappears when you screenshot it](https://unscreenshottable.vercel.app/?text=Hello)
**Score:** 568 | **Comments:** 193 | **ID:** 45284311

> **Project:** A web-based project where text is rendered using a visual illusion. The text is only visible during animation (as the eye integrates the frames), but becomes indiscernible random noise in any single frame, making it "un-screenshotable". The project is accessible via a URL that accepts a text parameter.
>
> **Discussion:** Users found the effect impressive but debated its practicality. The main technical insight is that the text is hidden using random noise patterns that only resolve when in motion, similar to a "Dalmatian illusion" or a specific video game effect. Several methods to bypass the protection were identified: taking a screen recording (video) instead of a static screenshot, zooming out the browser view, or using long-exposure photography. There were reports of the effect failing on Firefox for Android, likely due to canvas fingerprinting protection. A user proposed adapting the technique for LLM-proof video captchas, though others noted accessibility concerns.

## [Apple: SSH and FileVault](https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/apple_ssh_and_filevault.7.html)
**Score:** 507 | **Comments:** 185 | **ID:** 45294440

> **Article:** The article, an official Apple man page, documents a new feature in macOS 26 "Tahoe" that allows SSH to function before a user has logged in to unlock the FileVault-encrypted data volume. Normally, SSH configuration files are stored on the encrypted volume, making them inaccessible at boot. The new system enables password-based SSH authentication from the very start of the boot process. When a user successfully authenticates via SSH, the system uses that password to unlock and mount the data volume. After the volume is mounted, the SSH session is briefly disconnected and then re-established, providing full access to the system.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users celebrating the change as a long-awaited solution for remote administration of Macs. The key points are:

*   **Solves a Major Pain Point:** Users highlight that this finally enables true "headless" server use for Mac Minis, allowing them to be rebooted remotely without needing a physical keyboard and monitor to unlock FileVault. This was previously a major blocker for using Macs as corporate or remote servers.
*   **Security Considerations:** Some users expressed initial suspicion about a potential attack vector. However, others clarified that the primary risk is the same as any password-based SSH login, which can be mitigated by placing the machine behind a VPN (like Wireguard). The system requires password authentication, as SSH keys are not available until after the data volume is unlocked.
*   **Mechanism and Edge Cases:** Commenters theorized that a "pre-unlock" SSH session is used solely for authentication and unlocking the volume. A potential race condition was also mentioned, where services might start before the volume is fully mounted, but it was noted that Apple's "userspace reboot" process likely solves this.
*   **Context and Comparison:** The feature was noted as a significant improvement over the previous state, which sometimes forced users to disable FileVault entirely on servers. Some commenters also pointed out that Linux has had similar capabilities for years, either via TPM-based auto-unlock or by including an SSH server in the initial ramdisk (initrd) to allow for remote unlocking.

## [Meta’s live demo fails; “AI” recording plays before the actor takes the steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1nkbig7/metas_live_staged_demo_fails_the_ai_recording/)
**Score:** 466 | **Comments:** 342 | **ID:** 45294859

> **Article:** The article links to a Reddit post in r/LivestreamFail showing a clip from a Meta live event. The clip appears to show a live AI demo failing, where a pre-recorded AI voiceover plays before the on-stage actor performs the corresponding action, suggesting the "live" demo was staged or malfunctioned. The post title explicitly calls it a "staged demo fail."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of Meta and the demo, focusing on several key points:

*   **Cringe and Poor Execution:** Many commenters found the demo "painful" and "cringe-worthy," comparing it to a "Black Mirror" episode. Several users criticized Mark Zuckerberg's "robotic" presentation style, contrasting it unfavorably with Steve Jobs' famous keynote performances.
*   **Skepticism of AI Claims:** There is significant cynicism regarding the state of AI, with one user calling it "hot trash" and another suggesting that billionaire investment is driven by a fantasy of replacing human labor rather than genuine utility.
*   **Technical Explanations vs. Conspiracy:** While the post implies the demo was faked, some users offered technical explanations, such as poor Wi-Fi in a crowded venue causing timing issues. However, others remained skeptical, noting the failure looked like a "hard coded demo" that was poorly timed.
*   **Defense of Live Demos:** A minority opinion praised Meta for attempting live demos, arguing that it is more honest than the heavily edited, "neutered" presentations used by competitors like Apple.

## [Grief gets an expiration date, just like us](https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/oh-fuck-youre-still-sad)
**Score:** 461 | **Comments:** 211 | **ID:** 45290021

> **Article:** The article is a personal essay by Bess Stillman about her ongoing grief following the death of her husband, Jake, from cancer. She reflects on the societal and medical pressure to "get over" grief by a certain time, referencing the concept of "Prolonged Grief Disorder." Stillman argues that her grief is not a disorder but a natural, enduring response to a profound loss. She describes functioning in her daily life—working, caring for her child—while simultaneously carrying a deep, persistent sadness. The piece is a raw and articulate defense of the personal, non-linear nature of grieving, pushing back against the idea that there is an "expiration date" for sorrow.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is deeply empathetic, with many users recognizing the author from her previous, widely-shared articles about her husband's illness and her own grief. Key discussion points include:
*   **Critique of Medicalization:** Many commenters agree with the author's sentiment that society, particularly in the West, medicalizes and stigmatizes grief, creating unrealistic timelines for recovery. They argue this stems from a fear of death and a lack of healthy cultural rituals for mourning.
*   **The Role of Religion and Culture:** Some users posit that the loss of religious frameworks, which once provided a context for death and the afterlife, has made grief more terrifying and nihilistic for modern society.
*   **Personal Experiences with Grief:** Numerous users shared their own long-term experiences with grief, validating the article's theme that grief can persist for decades and resurface unexpectedly, often through vivid dreams.
*   **Nuance on "Disordered" Grief:** A counterpoint was raised that the medical definition of "disordered" grief is often misunderstood. One user argued that the diagnosis is intended for cases where grief is debilitating and prevents functioning, which doesn't appear to be the author's situation, and that the problem is the misuse of medical terms in everyday language.
*   **Practicality of Diagnosis:** A pragmatic view was also offered, noting that a medical diagnosis can be necessary to access benefits like time off work or insurance-covered therapy.

## [This map is not upside down](https://www.maps.com/this-map-is-not-upside-down/)
**Score:** 365 | **Comments:** 514 | **ID:** 45292694

> **Article:** The article argues that the standard "North-up" world map orientation is an arbitrary convention that reinforces a psychological bias, where "top" is perceived as "good" and "bottom" as "bad." It presents an alternative "South-up" map to challenge this perspective and encourage readers to question ingrained geographical norms. The piece suggests that this orientation subtly influences our worldview, particularly in the context of the Global North vs. Global South dichotomy.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was multifaceted. Key points include:

*   **Psychological and Cultural Bias:** Many users agreed with the article's premise, noting that the "top is good" bias is a product of both reading direction (top-to-bottom) and the map conventions themselves. Some linked this to the "Global North/South" terminology.
*   **Historical and Practical Justifications:** Several commenters defended the North-up orientation. They cited practical reasons like navigation (aligning with latitude lines) and the fact that the vast majority of the world's population and landmass is in the Northern Hemisphere. One user provided a compelling astronomical justification: for Northern Hemisphere dwellers, "up" is the direction of the celestial pole (Polaris), which is also due north.
*   **Pop Culture References:** A significant portion of the discussion revolved around a famous clip from *The West Wing* where characters debate the merits of a South-up map, which many users cited as their first introduction to the concept.
*   **Visual Perception and Projections:** Users discussed how the flipped map alters the appearance of continents (e.g., the Americas looking like a "duck" or "rabbit") and how map projections affect the perceived size of countries like Russia.
*   **Personal Anecdotes:** Commenters from the Southern Hemisphere shared that the orientation never felt like a "problem" to them, while others shared classroom experiences showing the map to children.

## [Learn Your Way: Reimagining Textbooks with Generative AI](https://research.google/blog/learn-your-way-reimagining-textbooks-with-generative-ai/)
**Score:** 359 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 45292648

> **Article:** The article from Google Research introduces "Learn Your Way," an experimental project that uses generative AI to reimagine textbooks. The system aims to create personalized learning experiences by converting existing educational content (like PDFs) into interactive, adaptive lessons. Key features include generating personalized learning plans, creating engaging examples tailored to a student's interests (e.g., explaining physics using basketball), and providing interactive quizzes. The goal is to move beyond static text and offer a more dynamic, one-on-one tutoring-like experience at scale.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the project's value and impact. Key points of critique include:

*   **Skepticism of EdTech:** Many commenters express a general distrust of the EdTech industry, arguing that it often prioritizes flashy technology over proven pedagogical methods and is driven by sales to school districts rather than genuine educational needs.
*   **Superficiality vs. Deep Tutoring:** Several users, including a former physics teacher, argue that the tool is a superficial improvement on existing methods ("chalk and talk") rather than a true replacement for effective human tutoring. They contend that the real challenge in education is diagnosing and correcting deep-seated misconceptions in students, which this system may not address.
*   **Focus on the Wrong Problem:** A recurring theme is that the problem isn't a lack of engaging content, but rather a lack of student motivation, especially in a world where AI threatens to automate many skilled jobs. The tool is seen as a "better textbook" when what's needed is a better tutoring experience.
*   **Data Privacy Concerns:** One commenter cynically notes that the tool is a way to get users to upload their data (PDFs) for training purposes.
*   **Positive Niche Use Cases:** Despite the skepticism, some users shared links to similar, open-source tools they've built for interacting with academic papers (e.g., asXiv, Ruminate), suggesting a use case for AI in summarization and Q&A for technical documents.
*   **Cultural References:** The discussion is peppered with references to science fiction, particularly Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age*, which envisioned a highly advanced AI tutor, highlighting the long-held aspirations for this technology.

Overall, the community reaction is one of tempered expectations, viewing the project as a technologically interesting but potentially misguided application of AI in education.

## [CERN Animal Shelter for Computer Mice (2011)](https://computer-animal-shelter.web.cern.ch/index.shtml)
**Score:** 348 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 45286369

> **Article:** The article is a webpage from CERN titled "CERN Animal Shelter for Computer Mice." It is a whimsical, retro-styled website that humorously presents a "shelter" for old and broken computer mice. The page features photos of various vintage computer mice, each given a name and a fictional personality or condition (e.g., "Shy," "Panicking," "Aggressive"). The site's tone is playful and nostalgic, mimicking the style of an animal shelter adoption page.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly nostalgic and positive. Commenters express delight at the site's "soul" and "whimsy," lamenting that this type of personal, quirky internet content has been largely lost to modern, corporate web design. Several users share resources for finding similar "old web" sites, such as Wiby and Marginalia Search. The conversation also branches into related topics: a humorous debate about the plural of "mouse" (mouses vs. mice), a shared frustration with modern product quality and planned obsolescence, and a recurring joke about CERN's other "animal" projects like the "Large Hamster Collider" and a fake article about quantum entanglement in sheep. The overall sentiment is one of appreciation for CERN's culture and a longing for a more creative and less commercial internet.

## [When Knowing Someone at Meta Is the Only Way to Break Out of "Content Jail"](https://www.eff.org/pages/when-knowing-someone-meta-only-way-break-out-content-jail)
**Score:** 311 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 45293273

> **Article:** The article from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argues that Meta's content moderation systems are opaque, automated, and often erroneous, effectively placing users in "content jail" without recourse. The only reliable way to escape this situation, the article claims, is through personal connections—knowing someone at Meta who can escalate the issue to a human moderator. This highlights a two-tiered system of justice where average users are left powerless, while those with insider access can have their problems swiftly resolved, underscoring the fundamental lack of due process on centralized platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expanding it to show that the problem is endemic across all major tech platforms, not just Meta. Key points from the discussion include:

*   **Widespread Problem:** Commenters share similar negative experiences with YouTube, Google, Twitter, and even Amazon, citing a lack of human support, arbitrary account bans, and the common tactic of seeking help via public social media pressure (e.g., begging the "Team YouTube" on Twitter).
*   **Lack of Recourse:** A recurring theme is the complete absence of meaningful appeal processes. Users described losing years of memories, business connections, and paid-for digital goods with no way to contact a human or understand the reason for a ban.
*   **Broader Implications:** Several users expressed concern that this lack of due process extends beyond content to critical aspects of digital life, such as identity verification and access to services (e.g., Uber, LinkedIn), creating a risk of being "blacklisted" without explanation.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** The most common advice was to "own your platform"—use personal websites for primary content and use social media only as a distribution channel. This avoids being entirely at the mercy of a platform's arbitrary rules.
*   **Systemic Critique:** The discussion concluded with a critique of the entire Web2 business model, arguing that centralized platforms are incentivized to prioritize profit and control over user rights, leading to a call for decentralized, open-source alternatives.

## [Scream cipher](https://sethmlarson.dev/scream-cipher)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 102 | **ID:** 45287474

> **Article:** The article "Scream cipher" introduces a simple substitution cipher that replaces standard Latin characters with their diacritic-heavy Unicode equivalents (e.g., 'a' becomes 'Ä'). The author presents this as a playful, visual form of obfuscation, noting that while it looks complex, it is easily reversible and not secure. The primary purpose is aesthetic novelty rather than cryptographic utility.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around the cipher's lack of security, with users comparing it to trivial encodings like ROT13 or Base64. Commenters quickly identified the cipher's pattern and the XKCD comic that inspired it. The conversation then expanded into related topics, including:
*   **Zalgo Text:** Users discussed using "Zalgo" text (stacked combining characters) to hide large amounts of data within a single character, referencing a "zalgo256" encoding scheme.
*   **Steganography:** A linked project (unisteg) was shared, which uses invisible characters to hide data in Telegram messages for bypassing metadata limits.
*   **Alternative Encodings:** Links to high-density Unicode encodings like Base65536 were provided.
*   **Humor:** The thread included jokes about creating competing standards and using AI to generate a "Scream Cipher" tool.

## [American Prairie unlocks another 70k acres in Montana](https://earthhope.substack.com/p/victory-for-public-access-american)
**Score:** 291 | **Comments:** 191 | **ID:** 45291132

> **Article:** The article from "Earth Hope" reports that the non-profit American Prairie has acquired 70,000 acres of land in Montana from two billionaire Texas brothers. The land was previously privately owned and used to block public access to adjacent public lands. This acquisition is framed as a victory for public access and conservation, as the land will now be managed for ecological restoration and allow the public to access the surrounding state and federal lands. The article highlights the conflict between private land ownership and public access rights in the American West.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive towards the acquisition but delves into complex philosophical and legal debates about land ownership.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **Property Rights Philosophy:** A central debate emerged between users arguing from a Lockean/homesteading perspective (ownership derives from use/development) and those arguing that the state is the ultimate owner and individuals are merely users. One user noted that the historical English doctrine of property was used to justify dispossessing Native Americans.
*   **Public Access vs. Private Property:** Many commenters, particularly those from Montana, celebrated the move as a way to reverse a trend of wealthy outsiders locking the public out of public lands. They argued that allowing public access is crucial for building political support for conservation.
*   **Comparison to the UK:** A highly upvoted comment praised the UK's system of public rights-of-way across private land as a more intelligent model, contrasting it with the American system's strict private property rights. This sparked a counter-debate about the UK's history of land enclosure and its inability to support large-scale wilderness.
*   **Skepticism and Nuance:** A few users were skeptical of the reporting, questioning the claim that access was completely blocked and suggesting the "evil" framing was biased. Others debated the legal nuances of "corner crossing" (a method for accessing public land surrounded by private property).
*   **Conservation Strategy:** The discussion also touched on the best ways to achieve conservation, with one user noting that buying land is expensive and that conservation easements or donations can be more efficient strategies.

## [Flipper Zero Geiger Counter](https://kasiin.top/blog/2025-08-04-flipper_zero_geiger_counter_module/)
**Score:** 270 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 45289453

> **Article:** The article details a DIY project to build a Geiger counter module for the Flipper Zero multi-tool. The author provides instructions, schematics, and a 3D-printable case for the module, which uses a high-voltage GM tube to detect ionizing radiation. The project is presented as a way to add a new, interesting capability to the popular hacking device.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is centered on three main themes: safety concerns, the value proposition of the project, and alternative methods for radiation detection.

*   **Safety:** Several users immediately flagged the exposed high-voltage leads on the module as a significant safety hazard and a "footgun," jokingly referring to it as a "built-in taser." Others debated whether the low battery voltage made it safe, but it was clarified that the boost converter generates the high voltage needed for the tube.

*   **Value & Alternatives:** A prominent debate emerged about the practicality of such a project. Some users argued that for a similar price, one could buy a pre-built Geiger counter kit. A more advanced argument was made that for 2.5x the cost, devices like the Radiacode offer full gamma spectrometry, providing vastly more capability and making the basic Geiger counter "e-waste from the factory" for most hobbyists. A counterpoint was made that for many, the novelty and low cost of a basic kit are the primary drivers, not a need for advanced features.

*   **Practicality & Curiosity:** Other comments touched on the practical use of such a device, like setting dose alarms. Users also shared their experiences with detecting radiation from common household items, with many noting that cheap GM tubes are often not sensitive enough to register bananas or smoke detectors, and typically require vintage uranium glass for a noticeable reading.

*   **Related Ideas:** Some users brought up tangential ideas, such as using a camera sensor to detect radiation or the concept of a program that could self-heal from bit-flips caused by radiation.

## [U.S. already has the critical minerals it needs, according to new analysis](https://www.minesnewsroom.com/news/us-already-has-critical-minerals-it-needs-theyre-being-thrown-away-new-analysis-shows)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 390 | **ID:** 45294058

> **Article:** The article argues that the United States possesses sufficient domestic reserves of critical minerals, such as rare earth elements, to meet its needs. The primary issue is not a lack of resources, but that these minerals are currently being discarded as waste (tailings) from existing mining operations rather than being processed and recovered. The piece suggests that the perceived mineral shortage is a solvable problem of extraction and processing, not geological scarcity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the significant environmental, economic, and geopolitical hurdles that prevent the US from exploiting its own mineral resources, even if they are technically available.

Key points of the discussion include:
*   **Environmental and Regulatory Barriers:** The overwhelming consensus is that mining and, crucially, refining critical minerals is an extremely "dirty" and polluting process. Commenters point out that the US has outsourced this work for decades to avoid the environmental damage and public backlash, a policy that has now created a strategic vulnerability.
*   **Geopolitical and Economic Realities:** Users highlight that China dominates the industry not just through resource control, but by state-backed investment and a willingness to "eat the cost of the externality" (i.e., accept severe pollution). Several commenters argue that the US needs a similar industrial policy, such as state-owned enterprises or sovereign wealth funds, to compete.
*   **Market Failures and Bureaucracy:** The discussion notes that domestic production is often unprofitable due to low global prices, which China can manipulate. A former DoD employee confirms that even when risks were identified, procurement rules favoring the lowest cost (from China) and a lack of political will prevented change.
*   **NIMBYism and Political Will:** Many commenters express skepticism that the US public or government would accept the environmental scars and pollution required for large-scale domestic processing, citing examples like the difficulty of building dams or desalination plants in California.
*   **Existing but Insufficient Efforts:** While some point to the Mountain Pass mine in California as proof the US can produce rare earths, others note its history of being shut down by low prices. The discussion also mentions ongoing efforts by Australian companies (Iluka, Lynas) to build refineries, but these are seen as long-term and insufficient to break China's dominance quickly.

## [Yes, Jimmy Kimmel's suspension was government censorship](https://www.theverge.com/policy/781148/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-monologue-brendan-carr-censorship-first-amendment)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 45292130

> **Article:** The article from The Verge argues that the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show was an act of government censorship, not merely a business decision by the network. The author contends that the suspension was a direct result of pressure from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), specifically from its chairman Brendan Carr, who threatened to revoke the broadcast licenses of ABC affiliates over Kimmel's monologue about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The article frames this as a clear example of government officials using their regulatory power to punish speech they dislike, thereby chilling dissent and setting a dangerous precedent for media freedom.

## [TernFS – An exabyte scale, multi-region distributed filesystem](https://www.xtxmarkets.com/tech/2025-ternfs/)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 45290245

> **Article:** XTX Markets has open-sourced TernFS, a distributed filesystem designed for exabyte-scale, multi-region storage. The system is optimized for their specific use case: storing over 600PB of data in a single deployment, primarily for large, immutable files (median size 2MB). Key architectural decisions include using a specialized database for metadata (separating it from file content) to leverage immutability, and providing seamless real-time intercontinental replication. The project is licensed under GPLv2-or-later for core components, with client libraries under Apache-2.0 to allow for broader adoption.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was largely positive, with praise for the technical achievement and the decision to open-source the project. The discussion centered on a few key points:

*   **Use Case & Scale:** Commenters were impressed by the scale (over 500PB) and curious about the need for such massive storage, speculating it's for storing historical order book data for financial trading models.
*   **Technical Comparisons:** A primary discussion point was TernFS's limitation with tiny files. It was compared to systems like SeaweedFS, which handle small files well. The authors clarified that TernFS is not intended for that use case.
*   **Comparison with CephFS:** In response to a direct comparison, the authors explained that TernFS was chosen over CephFS because of its specialized metadata handling, its proven ability to scale to a single 600PB+ instance, and the critical need for seamless real-time intercontinental replication, which they believe Ceph cannot provide.
*   **Licensing:** The project's dual licensing model (GPLv2 for core, Apache-2.0 for clients) was noted and explained as a way to enable proprietary clients while allowing integration with GPL projects like the Linux kernel.
*   **Blockchain Speculation:** One user suggested it could be a foundation for a decentralized blockchain storage system, which led to a brief counter-argument that blockchain itself is the underpinning, not the other way around.

## [Why, as a responsible adult, SimCity 2000 hits differently](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/thirty-years-later-simcity-2000-hasnt-changed-but-i-have/)
**Score:** 249 | **Comments:** 345 | **ID:** 45285387

> **Article:** The article "Why, as a responsible adult, SimCity 2000 hits differently" reflects on how the author's perspective on the classic 1993 city-building game has evolved with age. As a child, the goal was to build the biggest, densest metropolis possible, treating the game as a pure sandbox of power. As an adult, the author finds themselves instinctively building more humane, sustainable cities—prioritizing green space, manageable traffic, and the well-being of the virtual citizens. The experience becomes a form of "urban planning therapy," a stark contrast to the frustrations of real-world bureaucracy. The article concludes that the game hasn't changed, but the player's values have, shifting from a desire for sheer scale to an appreciation for livability and order.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many users sharing their own evolved perspectives on the game. Key points of the conversation include:

*   **Maturity and Playstyle:** Many commenters agree that their approach to SimCity has matured. They now build leafy suburbs and prioritize citizen happiness over maximizing density, mirroring the article's experience.
*   **Real-World Parallels:** The discussion extends beyond the game to real-life values. One user notes that their perspective on urban planning shifted after having children, leading to an understanding of why people rely on cars, a view they previously dismissed.
*   **Simulation vs. Reality:** A technical debate emerges about the game's flawed traffic simulation, where journeys choose random paths at junctions. Some argue this makes realistic city design impossible, while others counter that one shouldn't expect perfect realism from a 90s game and should instead play within its abstract rules.
*   **Cultural Context:** Several non-American users pointed out that the game's zoning model (separate residential, commercial, and industrial areas) is a distinctly American model of urban planning, which felt alien and unrealistic to them until they saw it in real life.
*   **Nostalgia and UI:** Some users defended the game's clunky, dated UI as part of its charm, a remnant of their childhood experience learning its secrets.
*   **Broader Philosophical Takes:** The conversation branched into more speculative topics, including the future morality of AI in games and a counter-argument that real-life urban development *should* be more nimble and responsive like the game, lamenting modern stagnation.
