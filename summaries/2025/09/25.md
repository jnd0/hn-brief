## [ChatControl: EU wants to scan all private messages, even in encrypted apps](https://metalhearf.fr/posts/chatcontrol-wants-your-private-messages/)
**Score:** 1102 | **Comments:** 631 | **ID:** 45374500

> **Article:** The linked article, "ChatControl: EU wants to scan all private messages, even in encrypted apps," argues against a proposed EU regulation that would mandate service providers (like WhatsApp or Signal) to scan users' private, end-to-end encrypted messages for illegal content, primarily Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). The author contends that this effectively breaks encryption, creating a massive surveillance infrastructure and a security vulnerability that could be exploited by malicious actors. The article highlights the involvement of specific technology companies, notably Palantir and Thorn, in developing these scanning tools and questions the transparency and influence of these private entities on EU policy. It frames the proposal as a fundamental threat to privacy, freedom of expression, and the principle of secure correspondence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the proposed EU ChatControl regulation. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Recurring Threat & Inevitability:** Many commenters express fatigue, noting that similar surveillance proposals have been a recurring issue for over a decade. There's a sense of pessimism that these measures will eventually pass through persistence and public apathy.
*   **Technical and Practical Ineffectiveness:** Users point out the technical futility of the plan, arguing that it will be easily circumvented by tech-savvy individuals using open-source software, custom encryption, or simply moving to platforms outside of EU jurisdiction. This leads to a "dystopian cyberpunk" scenario where users must side-load software and fight against OS-level restrictions.
*   **Corruption and Corporate Influence:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the alleged corruption behind the proposal. Commenters cite the involvement of Palantir and Thorn, pointing to a lack of transparency, revolving doors between EU agencies and these companies, and undue corporate influence on legislation.
*   **Fundamental Rights and Legitimacy:** The debate touches on core political philosophy, with users arguing that the proposal is a violation of fundamental rights to privacy and corresponds to "thought crime." The consensus is that such a policy undermines the legitimacy of the state, which should be transparent while citizens remain private.
*   **Government Overreach and Surveillance:** There is a strong belief that this is not a new capability but an attempt to legalize and formalize surveillance that is already happening. The discussion also touches on related topics like the EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the push for RCS messaging, viewing them as part of a broader trend to control communication channels.

## [Microsoft blocks Israel’s use of its tech in mass surveillance of Palestinians](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians)
**Score:** 873 | **Comments:** 773 | **ID:** 45373564

> **Article:** The Guardian reports that Microsoft has blocked Israel's Unit 8200 (elite spy agency) from using its Azure cloud platform for mass surveillance of Palestinians. The article states that 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military data (equivalent to ~200 million hours of audio) was stored in Microsoft's Azure servers in the Netherlands. Microsoft determined that the surveillance data collection violated its terms of service.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on several key themes:

**Privacy & Corporate Responsibility**: Users debate whether Microsoft genuinely lacked visibility into the data usage due to customer privacy commitments, or if this is post-hoc PR management now that the information is public. There's concern about the balance between user privacy and corporate oversight.

**Geopolitical & Ethical Issues**: Many commenters express outrage that the Netherlands facilitated this surveillance. The discussion touches on the Israel-Palestine conflict, with some arguing surveillance could have prevented October 7th attacks, countered by others noting intelligence failures, not lack of surveillance, were the issue. There's strong sentiment against tech being used for "genocide."

**Microsoft's Internal Dynamics**: Users discuss Microsoft's claim that Israeli employees lied to headquarters about Azure's use, viewing this as Microsoft throwing its own staff under the bus and indicating internal trust issues.

**Business & Technical**: Some note that Azure was chosen over AWS likely due to Microsoft's existing dominance in government/enterprise software rather than technical superiority. The action is seen by some as a positive step, while others dismiss it as performative (like temporarily pulling a TV show).

**Timing**: Commenters link the decision to shifting international sentiment, citing recent UN findings and European nations recognizing Palestine as reasons companies may be changing positions to be on the "right side of history."

## [Death rates rose in hospital ERs after private equity firms took over](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/death-rates-rose-hospital-ers-private-equity-firms-took-study-finds-rcna233211)
**Score:** 785 | **Comments:** 495 | **ID:** 45372442

> **Article:** A study published in the *Annals of Internal Medicine* found that patient mortality rates in hospital emergency rooms increased significantly after private equity (PE) firms acquired the hospitals. The study compared nearly 500 PE-acquired hospitals with over 1,200 control hospitals between 2009 and 2019. It found that deaths within 30 days of an ER visit rose by 6.2% at PE-owned facilities. The researchers suggest this increase is likely due to cost-cutting measures typical of PE ownership, such as reducing staffing levels and cutting resources, rather than changes in patient volume or severity of illness.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion overwhelmingly expresses concern and criticism regarding private equity's role in healthcare. Key themes include:

*   **Criticism of Profit Motives:** Many commenters argue that the profit-driven nature of private equity is fundamentally incompatible with quality healthcare, leading to cost-cutting that endangers patients. One user memorably summarized the dynamic as, "Your appendix is my pension plan dividend."
*   **Systemic Issues:** The conversation broadened to critique the US healthcare system as a whole, described as a distorted marketplace with restricted competition, regulatory capture, and high costs (18% of GDP) despite poor outcomes.
*   **Lack of Empathy and Transparency:** Users noted a societal lack of empathy until a crisis affects one personally. There was a strong desire for transparency, with commenters asking for a way to identify PE-owned hospitals to avoid them.
*   **Skepticism and Nuance:** While the dominant sentiment was critical, some users raised valid questions about the study's methodology, such as whether patient demographics shifted or if sicker patients were simply diverted elsewhere. Others debated whether capitalism is inherently at odds with healthcare quality, with one user arguing that "capitalism" isn't the issue, but "parasitic" PE practices are.
*   **Broader Parallels:** The issue was connected to other industries where PE ownership has allegedly led to a decline in quality, such as the pet care industry.

## [ChatGPT Pulse](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pulse/)
**Score:** 627 | **Comments:** 730 | **ID:** 45375477

> **Article:** OpenAI announced "ChatGPT Pulse," a new feature that allows the AI to proactively initiate conversations and surface information to users, rather than solely responding to prompts. The feature is framed as a step towards making users more productive by having the AI "start the conversation" based on context.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reaction is largely skeptical and critical. Key themes include:

*   **Skepticism of Utility:** Many commenters question the problem this solves, viewing it as a feature nobody asked for or a sign that OpenAI is running out of ideas.
*   **Data Harvesting Concerns:** Users view this as a "bear signal," suggesting a desperate need for new data collection methodologies under the guise of innovation.
*   **Psychological & Safety Risks:** A prominent concern is the potential for negative mental health impacts. Users worry this will increase addiction, foster unhealthy parasocial relationships with the AI, and make it harder to distinguish machine output from human authority.
*   **Ecosystem Competition:** Some analysts view this as a necessary move for OpenAI to compete with Google's deep integration into user ecosystems (Calendar, Gmail, etc.), as being a "model-only" company is becoming a race to the bottom.
*   **Cynicism & Satire:** The tone is often mocking, with users joking about "vibe living," the "AI bubble," and the relentless push to connect all personal data.

## [Improved Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/continuing-to-bring-you-our-latest-models-with-an-improved-gemini-2-5-flash-and-flash-lite-release/)
**Score:** 540 | **Comments:** 279 | **ID:** 45375845

> **Article:** Google announced updates to its Gemini 2.5 Flash and Flash-Lite models. The updates claim improved intelligence on the Artificial Analysis index, faster response times, and 24-50% better output token efficiency (lowering costs). Specific improvements for Flash-Lite include better instruction following, reduced verbosity, and stronger multimodal/translation capabilities. Flash improvements focus on better agentic tool use and more token-efficient reasoning. The new model versions are named `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025` and `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025`.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by two main themes: criticism of Google's model naming conventions and a debate on the utility of the Flash models versus Pro/competitor models.

**Naming and Versioning:**
Multiple users expressed frustration with the naming scheme (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025`), arguing that it is confusing and lacks the clarity of semantic versioning. Users noted that "2.5" refers to the model generation, while the date suffix indicates an update, but many still found the practice messy compared to competitors like Anthropic.

**Model Performance & Utility:**
*   **Flash vs. Pro:** Users debated whether Flash is surpassing Pro. One user claimed Flash is faster and more direct, while Pro is slow and prone to rambling. However, others defended Pro as superior for complex tasks like research math, creative writing, and debugging, though they acknowledged Flash's speed and cost advantages.
*   **Speed vs. Intelligence:** A broader debate emerged regarding Google's strategy. Some argued Google is focusing on latency and cost (Flash's strengths), while Anthropic and OpenAI focus on raw intelligence. However, a counterpoint argued that Gemini is actually the best "normie" model for long conversations and OCR/image recognition, despite lacking in agentic coding tasks.
*   **User Experience:** A user shared a positive anecdote about switching from Google Search to the Gemini app for information retrieval, citing a lack of ads and SEO spam.

**Technical Nuance:**
Users discussed why the same model might produce different results across platforms, attributing it to system prompts, temperature settings, and quantization rather than the model weights themselves.

## [Man still alive six months after pig kidney transplant](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02851-w)
**Score:** 532 | **Comments:** 274 | **ID:** 45370798

> **Article:** The article from Nature reports a significant medical milestone: a man is still alive and showing stable kidney function six months after receiving a genetically modified pig kidney transplant. The procedure was performed on a 62-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease. The pig kidney was edited using CRISPR technology to remove pig-specific genes and add human genes to make it more compatible with the human immune system. This represents the longest a pig kidney has functioned in a human body and is a major step forward in the field of xenotransplantation, which aims to address the critical shortage of human organs for transplant.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of awe, dark humor, philosophical reflection, and practical questions about the future of medicine.

Key points of the discussion include:

*   **Awe and Perspective:** Many commenters express amazement at the "metal" nature of xenotransplantation, reflecting on how science fiction concepts are becoming reality. The conversation broadens to question how humanity will adapt to such profound technological changes.
*   **The Patient's Experience:** Several users highlight the grim reality for patients with kidney failure, noting that dialysis is a "hellish" experience. This context underscores the potential value of the procedure, even as an experimental stopgap, as it offers an alternative to a difficult quality of life.
*   **Managing Expectations:** A debate emerges about whether a 12-month survival is a "long-term outcome." One commenter argues that in the context of experimental surgery and the alternative of dialysis, this milestone is a significant success and a crucial step in an iterative process of improvement.
*   **Surprising Medical Facts:** The conversation veers into related medical trivia, such as the fact that transplanted hearts are not reattached to the nervous system and that transplanted organs can change size to fit the recipient.
*   **Humor and Pop Culture:** Users reference The Onion's "Porkin' Across America" series and make jokes about the pig's appearance ("Porco Rosso").
*   **Ethical and Societal Concerns:** One commenter contrasts this high-tech medical achievement with the ongoing failure to provide basic necessities like housing and healthcare to everyone, introducing a note of social critique.
*   **Personal Anecdotes and Regret:** A user shares a personal story about a friend who chose to die rather than continue on dialysis, reinforcing the procedure's potential value. Another commenter admits they previously thought the idea was "insane" and now realizes they were a "fool," highlighting the rapid pace of scientific progress.

## [The story of DOGE, as told by federal workers](https://www.wired.com/story/oral-history-doge-federal-workers/)
**Score:** 517 | **Comments:** 574 | **ID:** 45373102

> **Article:** The Wired article is an oral history from federal workers detailing the chaotic and "inhumane" implementation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The workers describe the initiative as a "haphazard, cruel dismantling" of government agencies, characterized by mass firings, a lack of understanding by the DOGE team (who are described as naive and asking "Why can't AI do that?"), and creating immense trauma and instability for public servants. The article suggests the true motive was not efficiency, but to fire agencies investigating Elon Musk's companies and remove competent people who might stand up to the administration.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of DOGE, viewing it as a "disgrace" and a failure. Key points of debate include:

*   **Motive and Effectiveness:** Most commenters agree the initiative was not about fiscal responsibility but about dismantling oversight and creating trauma. It's noted that DOGE failed to address the actual drivers of government spending (mandatory spending like Social Security and Medicare) and that Trump's subsequent policies increased the debt.
*   **Political Psychology:** A recurring theme is the bafflement at how federal workers could support the politicians who enacted these cuts. Commenters point to "LeopardsAteMyFace" stories, noting a disconnect where supporters blame anything but the administration's policies.
*   **The "Efficiency" Argument:** While some argue that government waste is a real problem, others counter that DOGE's methods were irrational for actual cost-cutting and that the real goal was to privatize government functions for the benefit of venture capital and private equity.
*   **Human Cost:** Several comments highlight the inhumane treatment of workers, with one user urging others to read the article despite its painful content. Others dismissed the workers' hardships, framing them as the expected consequences of leaving a privileged work-from-home arrangement.

## [Demand for human radiologists is at an all-time high](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists)
**Score:** 445 | **Comments:** 464 | **ID:** 45372335

> **Article:** The article argues that contrary to predictions that AI would replace human radiologists, demand for them is at an all-time high. It identifies three main reasons for this: 1) The total volume of medical imaging is rapidly increasing, outpacing any efficiency gains from AI. 2) Regulatory and insurance systems are reluctant to approve or cover fully autonomous radiology models, creating legal and financial hurdles. 3) A radiologist's job involves much more than just diagnosing scans; it includes patient consultation, procedures, and collaboration with other clinicians, tasks that AI cannot perform. The article concludes that AI will augment, not replace, radiologists by making them more efficient and allowing them to focus on more complex aspects of their work.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the idea that AI will replace radiologists in the near future, aligning with the article's conclusion but often for more critical or nuanced reasons. Key points from the discussion include:

*   **AI's Fallibility and the Need for Expert Oversight:** Many commenters argue that AI models are unreliable, prone to "hallucinations" (making up findings), and require an expert human to interpret their results and catch errors. This shifts the radiologist's job from image interpretation to "AI interpretation," which doesn't eliminate the need for them.
*   **The Radiologist's Role is Broader Than Diagnosis:** Several users, including one who identifies as a doctor and engineer, point out that a radiologist's job is not just reading scans but also consulting with other doctors, performing procedures, and managing complex cases. AI only addresses a fraction of these duties.
*   **Historical Context and Hype:** Commenters reference Geoffrey Hinton's famous 2016 prediction that people should stop training radiologists, framing it as an example of AI evangelism that has not come to pass.
*   **Economic and Systemic Inertia:** Some users argue that even if AI were perfect, the existing medical system's structure, regulations, and workflow would prevent a rapid replacement of human radiologists.
*   **Augmentation over Replacement:** The consensus is that AI will serve as a powerful tool to augment radiologists, increasing their productivity and helping them catch difficult-to-spot abnormalities, rather than making them obsolete.

> **Article:** The article announces the launch of the Raspberry Pi 500+, a new all-in-one keyboard computer priced at $200. It is an evolution of the Pi 500, featuring a premium Gateron KS-33 low-profile mechanical keyboard instead of the previous chiclet style. Key hardware upgrades include 16GB of RAM and, most notably, an internal M.2 slot for NVMe storage, addressing a major limitation of previous models. The device is positioned as a "premium" and "ultimate" all-in-one PC for hobbyists and retro-computing enthusiasts.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is polarized, centering on the product's identity, target audience, and value proposition.

Key points of debate include:
*   **Target Audience & Use Case:** Many commenters are confused about the product's purpose, arguing it's impractical compared to a standard mini-PC and keyboard setup. Others identify its niche: retro-computing hobbyists, educators, or as a first computer for children, valuing its all-in-one form factor and aesthetic.
*   **The "All-in-One" Label:** A significant point of contention is the marketing term "all-in-one PC." Users argue this is misleading, as an AIO traditionally includes a screen, whereas this device is a computer-in-a-keyboard that still requires a monitor.
*   **Hardware & Value:** The mechanical keyboard and internal M.2 slot are praised as major improvements. However, the use of an older CPU and the $200 price point (excluding monitor/mouse) are criticized as poor value compared to N150 mini-PCs.
*   **Niche Appeal:** The product is seen as a "love it or leave it" item. Enthusiasts appreciate the retro-aesthetic and keyboard quality, while practical users find it hard to justify its existence over more conventional and powerful alternatives.

## [Bundler Belongs to the Ruby Community](https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/)
**Score:** 373 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 45371061

> **Article:** The author, André Arko, a long-time maintainer of Bundler, announces that he has personally registered the "Bundler" trademark. He frames this as a necessary defensive action to protect the project from corporate capture, specifically referencing recent events where Ruby Central (with funding from Shopify) took control of the project's GitHub repository and infrastructure. Arko states his intention to hold the trademark in trust for the Ruby community, with the goal of transferring it to a new, truly community-governed organization to ensure the project remains independent.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the actions taken by Ruby Central and its corporate backers (specifically Shopify and DHH). Key points include:
*   **Legal Analysis:** Commenters speculate that Ruby Central's long inaction may have weakened any trademark claim they might have had, potentially making it "genericized" or abandoned. Arko's move is seen as a strategic defense.
*   **Corporate vs. Community:** A central debate is whether corporate funding and influence should be considered part of the "community." While some acknowledge the financial contributions of companies like Shopify, the prevailing sentiment is that the community consists of people, not corporate entities, and that the recent takeover was a hostile act.
*   **Frustration with Ruby Central:** Users express deep frustration with Ruby Central's lack of communication and transparency following the repository seizure, noting that promised community Q&A sessions have not been rescheduled.
*   **Motive for Takeover:** The most upvoted theory is that the takeover was a power grab by DHH and Shopify to control the project's direction and force contributors to work under their authority, rather than for any technical or community benefit.
*   **Outcome:** There is concern that this conflict could lead to a loss of long-time maintainers and a potential fork of key infrastructure, causing a permanent split in the community.

## [Amazon fined $2.5B for using deceptive methods to sign up consumers for Prime](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon)
**Score:** 369 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 45374064

> **Article:** The FTC announced a historic $2.5 billion settlement against Amazon for using deceptive "dark patterns" to trick consumers into signing up for Prime and making it difficult to cancel. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion for consumer restitution. An estimated 30 million consumers may receive up to $51 each, with some receiving automatic payouts and others needing to file a claim. Crucially, Amazon is also required to cease its unlawful enrollment and cancellation practices.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is divided on the significance of the fine. Some users argue the $2.5 billion penalty is a "tiny percent" of Amazon's profits and thus not a meaningful deterrent. The main point of agreement is that the real victory is the court-ordered change to Amazon's "dark patterns," which many commenters described as notoriously difficult to navigate. Several users shared personal anecdotes of Amazon's deceptive checkout and cancellation flows, with many comparing them to other companies like Adobe and Netflix. There was also some confusion about the specific deceptive practices, as some users felt their own experiences were not overtly problematic. A secondary topic was the political attribution of the press release to the "Trump-Vance" administration, which some users noted was unusual. Finally, some debated the value of Prime itself, with some finding the shipping benefits addictive while others argued it encourages impulse buying and that free shipping thresholds are often a better deal.

## [Redis is fast – I'll cache in Postgres](https://dizzy.zone/2025/09/24/Redis-is-fast-Ill-cache-in-Postgres/)
**Score:** 352 | **Comments:** 300 | **ID:** 45380699

> **Article:** The article "Redis is fast – I'll cache in Postgres" explores the idea of using PostgreSQL as a simple key-value cache instead of introducing a separate Redis instance. The author, seeking to minimize infrastructure complexity for a new project, sets up a basic cache table in Postgres and benchmarks its performance. The results show that for their specific use case, Postgres is "fast enough," leading them to conclude that they can avoid the operational overhead of managing another service (Redis) and stick with a single, familiar database.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a mix of agreement, skepticism, and technical nuance. Key points include:

*   **Critique of the Benchmark:** Several users argue the benchmark is flawed, as it primarily tests network round-trip time (RTT) rather than the peak throughput of Redis. They suggest that using pipelining on both Redis and Postgres would show a much larger performance gap in Redis's favor.
*   **Operational Complexity:** A central debate is whether the operational simplicity of using one database (Postgres) outweighs the feature set of Redis. Proponents of the Postgres-only approach value reducing the number of services to manage. Critics point out that implementing features like TTL (Time-To-Live) requires custom solutions (like cron jobs), which introduces its own complexity and potential points of failure.
*   **Feature Comparison:** Users highlight that Redis offers critical cache-specific features out-of-the-box, such as TTLs, which are not native to Postgres and must be manually implemented.
*   **Alternatives and Context:** The discussion mentions projects like Redka (which provides a Redis API on top of Postgres/SQLite) and notes that the "right tool for the job" depends on the specific use case, load, and performance requirements. Many advise starting simple (with Postgres) and only adding Redis if profiling shows it's necessary.

**Score:** 348 | **Comments:** 176 | **ID:** 45377641

> **Article:** Ollama announced a new "Web Search" feature that allows its AI models to retrieve real-time information from the internet. The feature is designed to augment smaller models with up-to-date data and enable larger models to perform deeper research. It is available through Ollama's cloud service, requiring an API key, and is positioned as a solution for users who cannot or do not want to run large models locally. The blog post emphasizes that users own the search results and that Ollama works with search providers to ensure zero data retention policies.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely critical and skeptical of Ollama's new direction. Key points of contention include:

*   **Shift from Local-First Philosophy:** Many users are concerned that Ollama is abandoning its core identity as a local-first, open-source tool in favor of a paid cloud service. This is seen as a "deceptive" pivot that goes against the community's expectations.
*   **Paywalling and Monetization:** The requirement for an Ollama account and a paid subscription ($20/month) for the feature is a major point of friction. Users question the value proposition compared to other AI services, especially for "small inferior models."
*   **Lack of Transparency:** Commenters are asking for technical details that are missing from the announcement, specifically which search engine provider is used under the hood and the legal licensing of the search results.
*   **Existing Alternatives:** Several users pointed out that similar functionality can be achieved for free using local tools like SearXNG or by integrating other full-text search systems (e.g., Solr, Typesense), making Ollama's paid offering less compelling.
*   **Developer Concerns:** There is a sentiment that Ollama should focus on improving core local functionality, such as robust tool use, rather than pushing cloud-based features.

## [Knotty: A domain-specific language for knitting patterns](https://t0mpr1c3.github.io/knotty/index.html)
**Score:** 344 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 45369768

> **Article:** The article introduces "Knotty," a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for creating knitting patterns. It presents a text-based syntax that can be compiled into various formats, including visual charts, written instructions, and machine-readable code. The language aims to formalize the complex rules and constraints of knitting into a programmable system, allowing for precise and potentially automated pattern creation. The project is framed as a modern application of computational principles to a traditional craft, with examples like a pixel art Mega Man pattern used to demonstrate its capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the historical context and automation of textile crafts. Many commenters draw a direct line from Knotty back to the 19th-century Jacquard loom, which used punch cards to automate weaving and is considered a precursor to modern computing. This sparks a debate on whether the loom was a true computer and a clarification that weaving and knitting are distinct processes.

The conversation also explores the future of automation, with mentions of existing Lego knitting machines and industrial crochet machines, challenging the common belief that crochet cannot be automated. Other notable points include:
*   **Language Design:** A deep analysis of Knotty's design principles, highlighting how it treats physical reality as a type system and prioritizes expert efficiency over beginner-friendliness.
*   **Humor and Naming:** Lighthearted comments about the name "Knotty" and the missed opportunity to call it "Purl."
*   **Personal Interest:** A non-knitter expressing appreciation for the Mega Man example, and a comment about the aesthetic appeal of Lisp-like parentheses in the language's syntax.

## [Athlon 64: How AMD turned the tables on Intel](https://dfarq.homeip.net/athlon-64-how-amd-turned-the-tables-on-intel/)
**Score:** 331 | **Comments:** 256 | **ID:** 45376605

> **Article:** The article chronicles how AMD's Athlon 64 processor, released in 2003, dramatically shifted the balance of power in the CPU market away from Intel. It details the context of the early 2000s, where Intel was pushing its new 64-bit Itanium architecture (IA-64), which was incompatible with the existing 32-bit x86 software that dominated the market. The article argues that Itanium was a commercial failure due to its complexity, poor backward compatibility, and the need for a complete software rewrite.

In contrast, AMD developed the AMD64 architecture, a 64-bit extension to the existing x86 instruction set. This was a masterstroke: it offered a seamless transition to 64-bit computing by running all existing 32-bit software at full native speed, while providing the benefits of 64-bit (like more registers and addressing) as "gravy." The Athlon 64 not only introduced 64-bit computing to the consumer market but also outperformed Intel's contemporary Pentium 4 processors in 32-bit tasks. This forced Intel to abandon its own 64-bit plans and adopt AMD's design, which it licensed as "EM64T" (later Intel 64), cementing AMD64 as the industry standard (x86-64) that all modern computers still use.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of nostalgic recollection, technical deep-dives, and historical analysis. Key points include:

*   **Nostalgia and Personal Experience:** Many commenters fondly recall building and using Athlon 64 systems, often highlighting the massive performance leap over previous generations and the specific components of their "dream builds" from that era.
*   **The Failure of Itanium:** There is a strong consensus that Itanium was a strategic blunder by Intel. Commenters describe it as overly complex (VLIW architecture), difficult to compile for, and fatally crippled by its lack of backward compatibility with the massive x86 software ecosystem.
*   **Intel's Internal Blunders:** A major point of discussion is the revelation that Intel had its own internal 64-bit x86 extension for the Pentium 4 (codenamed "Yamhill") but deliberately disabled it to avoid competing with Itanium. This is cited as a prime example of Intel's strategic arrogance and its tendency to "cannibalize" its own products.
*   **Technical Nuances:** The discussion includes technical clarifications on why 64-bit operating systems dropped support for 16-bit applications (it's a limitation of the CPU's long mode, not just an OS choice) and praise for the elegance of the AMD64 design (e.g., doubling the number of general-purpose registers).
*   **Historical Context:** Users note that at the time, the dominance of x86 was not a foregone conclusion, with other architectures like Alpha, PowerPC, and SPARC still being viable. This context helps explain why Intel felt it could attempt a radical break with Itanium.
*   **Corporate Cycles:** The conversation touches on Intel's historical pattern of making significant market-share mistakes (Pentium 4, Itanium) only to recover later with a blockbuster product (Core 2 Duo, etc.), suggesting their current challenges are more related to manufacturing than to design competition from AMD.

## [Electron-based apps cause system-wide lag on macOS 26 Tahoe](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/48311)
**Score:** 302 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 45376977

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue reporting that Electron-based applications (like Slack, VS Code, Discord) are causing system-wide lag, stuttering, and high GPU usage on the new macOS 26 Tahoe. The root cause is identified as Electron apps overriding a private AppKit API (`_cornerMask`) to create custom visual effects. This hack, intended to make web-based apps look native, breaks with the new OS update, causing a resource leak in the macOS WindowServer that degrades overall system performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on assigning blame, offering workarounds, and debating the broader implications of Electron.

Key points include:
*   **Root Cause & Blame:** The consensus is that Electron is at fault for using private APIs, but Apple is also criticized for releasing a buggy OS and for breaking software that users rely on.
*   **Workarounds:** A specific command-line fix (`defaults write ...`) is shared to disable the problematic feature in Chrome/Electron apps, and it's noted that a permanent patch is being developed.
*   **General Sentiment:** Many users use the opportunity to voice long-standing complaints about Electron's performance and resource usage ("I see Electron I don't install"), while others defend it as a necessary tool for cross-platform development.
*   **Scope of the Problem:** While the main issue is tied to Electron, some commenters note that other non-Electron apps are also experiencing performance problems with macOS 26, suggesting broader OS instability.

## [Resurrect the Old Web](https://stevedylandev.bearblog.dev/resurrect-the-old-web/)
**Score:** 282 | **Comments:** 256 | **ID:** 45372113

> **Article:** The article "Resurrect the Old Web" is a nostalgic call to action for a return to a simpler, more personal internet. The author contrasts the current web, dominated by large platforms, algorithms, and commercialization, with the "Old Web" of personal blogs, static HTML sites, and RSS feeds. The piece advocates for creating and maintaining personal websites as a way to reclaim individuality, creativity, and a sense of community, free from the constraints and surveillance of modern social media. It champions platforms like BearBlog as a modern vehicle for this revival.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely supportive of the article's sentiment but adds significant nuance and historical context. Key points of the conversation include:

*   **Nostalgia vs. Reality:** Several commenters caution against idealizing the "Old Web," pointing out its downsides like rampant pop-up ads, browser compatibility issues (Internet Explorer), security vulnerabilities (Flash/Java), and poor design.
*   **The Platform Dilemma:** A central debate revolves around whether using a hosted platform like BearBlog is truly in the spirit of the Old Web. The creator of BearBlog argues that modern platforms with easy data portability are a valid evolution, while others insist true independence requires self-hosting.
*   **Modern Obstacles to a Personal Web:** Participants identify key challenges that didn't exist in the 90s, such as the prevalence of spam, DDoS attacks, and the high technical/legal burden of running a public-facing server today.
*   **The Loss of Community:** Many commenters lament that the community aspect of the Old Web (forums, IRC, instant messengers) has been replaced by "walled gardens" like Discord and Facebook groups, which hide information and are not easily searchable.
*   **Privacy and Control:** A recurring theme is the desire for privacy and control over one's own data, free from the surveillance capitalism and algorithmic manipulation that define the modern web.

## [The Theatre of Pull Requests and Code Review](https://meks.quest/blogs/the-theatre-of-pull-requests-and-code-review)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 416 | **ID:** 45371283

> **Article:** The article "The Theatre of Pull Requests and Code Review" argues that modern code review practices have become a performative ritual ("theatre") rather than a genuinely effective quality control mechanism. The author contends that the common advice to keep PRs small (e.g., under 300 lines) is often impractical for real-world features, forcing developers to split work into artificial, disconnected chunks. This process wastes time and obscures the holistic view of a feature. The article suggests that this focus on performative metrics (like PR size and review speed) undermines the true goal of collaboration and understanding, and that the current tooling (GitHub, Git) often works against efficient information flow.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely validates the article's premise that PR processes are often flawed, but offers a variety of solutions and perspectives. Key points include:

*   **Stacked PRs as a Solution:** Several commenters advocate for stacked PRs (a series of dependent PRs) as a way to manage complexity, allowing for small, reviewable units while preserving the context of a larger feature.
*   **The Importance of Context:** Many agree that the core problem is a lack of shared understanding. Commenters suggest that effective review requires out-of-band communication (pairing, design docs, targeted questions) and that the PR description is crucial for providing intent and context.
*   **Review is Not One-Size-Fits-All:** The discussion highlights that the purpose of a review varies. It can be a quick sanity check, a deep architectural critique, or a tool for knowledge sharing. The appropriate level of rigor depends on the codebase (e.g., core vs. peripheral), the team (internal vs. open source), and the change's risk.
*   **Process vs. People:** A recurring theme is that successful code review is more about team culture and trust than rigid rules. Commenters advocate for clear communication, avoiding nitpicking, and focusing on substantive feedback. There's a consensus that "performative" reviews are a symptom of a dysfunctional environment where trust is low.
*   **Pragmatism over Dogma:** While ideal commit hygiene (e.g., "history surgery") is praised, many acknowledge it's unrealistic for most teams. The focus should be on what works for the specific team and context, rather than chasing an ideal process.
