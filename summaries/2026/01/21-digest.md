The world is starting to bet against America, and the money is moving. A Danish pension fund just dumped $100 million in US Treasuries, citing "poor U.S. government finances." While that’s a rounding error in the daily Treasury market, the symbolism is deafening. It’s a quiet vote of no confidence, a single chip pushed across the table in a much larger game. This isn’t an isolated tremor; it’s part of a seismic shift. The "Sell America" trade is now mainstream, with capital fleeing US assets as global investors react to an administration that treats economic policy like a series of hostage negotiations. The dollar tumbles, allies are threatened with tariffs and invasion, and the post-WWII order is declared dead at Davos. The old rules are gone, and the new game is one of raw power, where economic integration is a weapon and middle powers are scrambling for survival.

This isn’t just about one president; it’s the culmination of decades of fiscal rot and political gridlock. The US national debt is a monument to bipartisan failure, a problem no one has the appetite to fix. The Danish fund’s move is a microcosm of a broader, structural de-dollarization that’s been quietly underway for years, as the Euro and other alternatives chip away at the dollar’s dominance. The Triffin Dilemma—where the world’s reserve currency must run perpetual deficits—is finally biting back. The trust that underpins a currency is fragile, and when you start using your financial system as a bludgeon against allies, you accelerate the very de-dollarization you fear. The US is learning the hard way that you can’t weaponize the world’s safe haven and expect it to remain safe.

While the macro world wobbles, the tech world is busy navel-gazing and fighting its own demons. Meta’s legal team, according to a scathing critique, has abandoned any pretense of ethics, perfecting a playbook of corporate obfuscation to shield the company from accountability for the harms it causes. This isn’t a surprise; it’s the logical endpoint of a culture that prioritizes shareholder value above all else, where human cost is just an externality to be managed. The same ethos trickles down to the developer level, where we see the "addiction to being useful"—a compulsion to solve problems that can easily curdle into burnout or, worse, a managerial style that stifles growth by never letting anyone figure things out for themselves. It’s a personal dysfunction that thrives in dysfunctional corporate machines.

And in the hardware world, the chickens of dependency are coming home to roost. Nvidia’s stock is a bubble waiting for a pin, and the market is finally pricing in the existential risk of a China-Taiwan conflict. The AI gold rush has created a monster, and the supply chain for its brain is a geopolitical flashpoint. Meanwhile, the IPv4 market has collapsed, with prices falling from a speculative peak of $55 per address back to 2014 levels. The lesson? Artificial scarcity propped up by hyperscaler greed eventually meets reality. The internet’s old, open spirit is fading, centralized into the hands of a few incumbents, and the protocols we have left are a battleground of legacy and progress.

Amidst the chaos, there are pockets of deep technical excellence and sobering reality checks. PostgreSQL’s hidden depths, from partial hash indexes to the `MERGE` command, remind us that the tools we take for granted are incredibly powerful if we bother to learn them. The debate over "agentic coding" provides a necessary reality check: AI agents are useful junior developers for boilerplate, but they can’t design a system and can’t be trusted without a human architect. The real work of software engineering—understanding trade-offs, managing complexity, and maintaining systems—remains stubbornly human. Similarly, the discussion on soft deletes is a classic engineering dilemma: the convenience of recoverability versus the legal and performance costs of keeping data you shouldn't. There are no perfect answers, only trade-offs.

On the lighter side, we have the nostalgia of a physical Unix pipe card game and the grim irony of a tool to fix a flickering terminal in an AI coding product from a company that promises to write all our code. It’s a reminder that for all the grand visions, the rubber often meets the road in frustrating, mundane ways. The acquisition of Nova Launcher by Instabridge is the final nail in the coffin for many, a textbook case of "enshittification" where a beloved tool is absorbed into a data-hungry conglomerate, its promises of minimal data collection ringing hollow.

**Worth watching:** The quiet exodus from US assets. It’s not a panic yet, but the trend is clear. When the world’s biggest pension funds start treating your debt as a liability to be shed, you should pay attention. The geopolitical and economic foundations are shifting in real-time, and the tech industry, for all its focus on disruption, is just another passenger on a ship whose course is being violently altered.
