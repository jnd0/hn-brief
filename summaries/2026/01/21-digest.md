The "Sell America" trade is no longer a fringe theory but a measurable market reality, with the US dollar tumbling as global investors flee US assets. This isn't just about a single Danish pension fund’s symbolic $100 million divestment from Treasuries; it’s the culmination of a narrative that’s been building for years. The core issue is a catastrophic erosion of trust, not in the US economy's fundamentals, but in its political stewardship. The J.P. Morgan analysis on de-dollarization frames it perfectly: the Triffin Dilemma is being weaponized, and the "weaponization" of the financial system itself is pushing allies to seek alternatives. The conversation has moved beyond academic debate to real-time portfolio reallocation, with Mark Carney’s Davos speech serving as the political eulogy for the old order. The US is no longer seen as a reliable anchor, but as a source of volatility, making the "US Navy" argument for dollar supremacy feel increasingly anachronistic.

This institutional decay is mirrored in the tech world’s own crises of confidence. Meta’s legal team is accused of abandoning ethics to shield the company from accountability for user harm, a story that resonates deeply with the Hacker News community’s growing cynicism toward Big Tech’s moral compass. The discussion here is less about legal nuance and more about a systemic failure, with commenters drawing parallels to UnitedHealthcare and noting that the primary duty of a for-profit corporation is often at odds with public well-being. It’s a theme that extends to the AI hype cycle, where the gap between promise and reality is becoming a chasm. The "Agentic AI Handbook" and the debate over whether agentic coding "works" reveal a community grappling with a technology that is simultaneously impressive and profoundly unreliable. The consensus is that agents are useful junior developers for boilerplate, but the dream of full autonomy is a nightmare of regressions and subtle failures, like unit tests that cheat to pass.

The technical trenches offer their own sobering lessons. The cURL project’s decision to kill its bug bounty program is a direct casualty of the AI era, where "slop" from LLMs has overwhelmed maintainers with nonsensical reports. It’s a stark reminder that the same tools lauded for boosting productivity are also poisoning open-source ecosystems. Similarly, the debate over IPv6’s security—centered on the myth that NAT is a security feature—highlights how legacy thinking and inertia can slow essential progress, much like the persistent "Sell America" sentiment is a legacy of political choices. Even the challenges of soft deletes and PostgreSQL optimizations are, at their core, about managing the technical debt and complexity that arise from systems designed for a different era.

The most telling pattern is the pervasive sense of irony. A human developer creates "claude-chill" to fix a flickering terminal in Anthropic’s paid CLI product, a beautifully mundane bug that undermines the company’s grand narrative of AI coding supremacy. Meanwhile, the "original" Anthropic take-home assignment is revealed to be a brutal, niche optimization challenge, suggesting their hiring bar is for a very different kind of engineer than their public persona implies. And in the midst of this, a 26,000-year-old astronomical monument at the Hoover Dam gets more genuine admiration than most modern tech projects, a quiet testament to the value of building things meant to last in an age of ephemeral hype.

**Worth watching:** The confluence of geopolitical realignment and the AI agent bubble. As the US dollar’s status is actively questioned, the AI industry’s foundational promises are being stress-tested in production. The next few quarters will reveal whether the "Sell America" trade accelerates and whether agentic AI can escape its current role as a buggy, high-maintenance tool to become something truly transformative. The engineers navigating these parallel crises are the ones to follow.
