## [Unrolling the Codex agent loop](https://openai.com/index/unrolling-the-codex-agent-loop/)
**Score:** 421 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46737630

> **Article:** The article "Unrolling the Codex agent loop" provides a technical deep-dive into the architecture of OpenAI's Codex CLI. It explains the core "agent loop" mechanism: the model is called, and if it requests a tool (like a file read or command execution), the tool is run and its output is fed back into the model's context. This iterative process continues until the model provides a final answer instead of a tool call. The post details how this loop is implemented, how context is managed across turns, and the specific prompts and system instructions that guide the model's behavior. It aims to demystify the inner workings of the agentic coding tool, which is open source.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community actively using and comparing various AI coding tools, with a focus on the practical implications of Codex's architecture.

A key technical insight from users is that Codex's reasoning tokens persist during a single agent tool-call loop but are discarded between user turns. This design preserves context during a single task but can lose information across related interactions. To mitigate this, some developers have adopted strategies like having the model write progress updates to markdown files, creating a persistent "snapshot" of its state.

The conversation also sparked a lively debate on the usability and performance of different CLI tools. While some users find Codex's performance "insane" and its UX seamless—praising features like Rust-based speed and refined keyboard shortcuts—others report issues with it being slow to build context compared to competitors like Amp or Claude Code. The general sentiment is that the field is competitive, with users actively experimenting with and comparing tools like Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.

Finally, the discussion touched on feature requests and the nature of OpenAI's open-source approach. Users expressed a desire for features like "checkpoints" (similar to Copilot) to save progress, with one user noting that the Codex team prioritizes features based on GitHub issue upvotes. While the open-source nature of the Codex CLI was praised for transparency, a counterpoint was raised about OpenAI's history with its founding charter, suggesting skepticism about the company's open-source commitments.

## [Doing gigabit Ethernet over my British phone wires](https://thehftguy.com/2026/01/22/doing-gigabit-ethernet-over-my-british-phone-wires/)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 193 | **ID:** 46742362

> **Article:** The article details the author's experience achieving gigabit Ethernet speeds (approx. 940 Mbps) over existing British telephone wiring (twisted pair) using G.hn technology. The author, frustrated by the lack of true gigabit fiber availability in their area and the difficulty of running new cables through thick walls, purchased a pair of G.hn adapters. These devices modulate network signals onto the existing copper phone lines. The author notes that while the wiring is likely Cat5e standard, the G.hn technology successfully navigates the "daisy-chain" topology and bridge taps typical of UK homes, which usually degrade DSL signals. The post concludes that this is a viable, high-performance solution for retrofitting high-speed networking into older buildings without invasive construction.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the technical feasibility of the author's setup, the state of UK internet infrastructure, and alternative networking solutions.

Technically, commenters expressed surprise at the performance given the typical "daisy-chain" wiring of UK homes, which usually causes signal reflections that kill DSL performance. However, experts noted that G.hn chipsets are highly adaptive, using OFDM to map the channel and avoid "noisy" frequencies caused by bridge taps, unlike standard DSLAMs. Several users confirmed that standard twisted pair phone wiring (often Cat5e) is frequently capable of gigabit speeds over short distances, with one user noting that simply replacing RJ11 wall plates with RJ45 can sometimes enable 100Mbps or 1Gbps links without adapters.

Regarding UK infrastructure, there was debate over the author's claim that gigabit internet isn't truly available. A London-based user countered that full-duplex fiber has been available in the capital since 2016. However, others highlighted the logistical difficulties of importing hardware due to Brexit-related customs delays, criticizing Royal Mail's tracking system and the lack of pre-paid VAT options on international orders.

Alternative solutions were also debated. While the author used G.hn adapters, some users advocated for physically pulling new Cat5e or Cat6 cables through walls (using old phone wires as pull-strings), though others argued this is too invasive for the average user. The discussion also touched on Wi-Fi 7 performance, with users noting that while speeds are high, wireless latency can still be inconsistent for real-time applications like gaming compared to a wired solution. Finally, a user shared a complex "Rube Goldberg" network setup involving bonded VDSL, Starlink, and 5G to overcome poor UK connectivity, highlighting the lengths enthusiasts go to for stable internet.

## [Comma openpilot – Open source driver-assistance](https://comma.ai)
**Score:** 329 | **Comments:** 185 | **ID:** 46740029

> **Article:** The article links to comma.ai, the website for Comma AI, a company that develops openpilot, an open-source driver-assistance system. openpilot is a software-based alternative to factory-installed advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), offering features like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist for a wide range of compatible vehicles.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising openpilot as impressive, life-improving technology and Comma AI as a refreshing alternative to subscription-based services like Tesla's FSD. Commenters appreciate the company's open-source ethos and contrary attitude, often contrasting CEO George Hotz ("geohotz") favorably against Elon Musk.

A central theme is the user experience and practical application of the system. Users clarify that out of the box, openpilot is primarily a sophisticated adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping system, not a full self-driving solution. It is most valued for road trips and stop-and-go traffic, though community forks like Sunnypilot can offer extended capabilities.

Key practical concerns raised include:
*   **Vehicle Compatibility:** A frequent point of discussion, with users expressing hope for support for their specific car models (e.g., Mitsubishi, Opel, Slate pickup).
*   **Insurance and Liability:** A user raised questions about insurance ramifications and liability in an accident. The consensus is that, similar to Tesla's system, the driver remains fully responsible and must be attentive, with an uphill battle to shift liability to the company.
*   **Product Clarity:** One user noted difficulty in understanding the product's exact capabilities from the website, highlighting a potential barrier for newcomers.

The conversation also touches on Comma AI's unique hiring process, which uses a public leaderboard, and the general accessibility of the technology as its price decreases.

## [How I estimate work](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/)
**Score:** 302 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46742389

> **Article:** The article "How I estimate work" by Sean Goedecke presents a pragmatic approach to software estimation, arguing that engineers should embrace estimation as a core part of their job rather than resisting it. The author's method involves first understanding the business's desired timeline (the "range my manager is looking for") and then working backward to determine what can be realistically delivered within that timeframe. This top-down approach contrasts with the more common bottom-up method of estimating individual tasks and summing them up. Goedecke contends that refusing to estimate simply forces a non-technical person to do it, which is often worse. He frames estimation as a negotiation of scope and technical approach, where the engineer's role is to find a viable path that fits the business constraints, rather than providing a single, often inaccurate, point estimate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing similar experiences and offering additional context. A dominant theme is the inherent difficulty and inaccuracy of estimation, often illustrated with cynical but relatable anecdotes. Several long-time engineers shared "old-timer" advice, such as multiplying initial estimates by pi (3.14) or by 4 (plan, test, document, then double it), highlighting a long-standing cultural belief that estimates are almost always optimistic.

The conversation also delves into the political and business pressures surrounding estimation. Commenters agree that the push for dates often comes from sales and management, who need a concrete answer to close deals and manage expectations. One commenter noted that a "done when it's done" answer can lose a customer, making a firm (even if speculative) date a business necessity. This reinforces the article's point that engineers who refuse to estimate cede control to less technical colleagues who may provide even more unrealistic timelines.

Beyond politics, participants discussed practical techniques. The "tracer bullet" approach—building a thin, end-to-end proof-of-concept to uncover unknowns before making a firm estimate—was suggested as a way to reduce uncertainty. Another commenter emphasized that estimation is an "art, not a science" and that engineers should simply think in terms of time (hours/days) from the start, as this is the only unit the rest of the business truly understands. Overall, the discussion was a mix of shared frustration, practical advice, and broad agreement that estimation is a crucial, if imperfect, engineering skill.

## [MS confirms it will give the FBI your Windows PC data encryption key if asked](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-bitlocker-encryption-keys-give-fbi-legal-order-privacy-nightmare)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 46743154

> **Article:** An article from Windows Central reports that Microsoft will provide the FBI with a user's BitLocker encryption key if presented with a valid legal order, such as a warrant. The article highlights that Microsoft backs up BitLocker keys to a user's Microsoft account by default, which makes them accessible to law enforcement. This policy is presented as a "privacy nightmare," contrasting it with systems like Linux where encryption keys typically remain solely on the user's device unless explicitly backed up by the user.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of resignation, technical clarification, and debate over user responsibility versus corporate policy. The community is largely unsurprised by Microsoft's policy, with many commenters noting that major tech corporations have been cooperating with legal requests for over a decade. There is a distinct divide on whether this is a necessary legal compliance or a privacy failure; some argue that no organization should be beyond the law, while others contend that companies should not hold "master keys" to user data at all.

Several users offered technical alternatives and clarifications. Commenters pointed to Linux as a system where encryption keys remain local by default, and suggested third-party tools like VeraCrypt or password managers like 1Password for users seeking true end-to-end encryption where the provider holds no keys. There was also significant discussion regarding Apple's security practices. While one user claimed Apple stores FileVault keys in iCloud (making them accessible via warrant), others countered that Apple's "Advanced Data Protection" feature renders cloud-stored data inaccessible to the company, though standard iCloud backups may still be vulnerable. Ultimately, the consensus leans toward user agency: if you want true privacy, you must manage your own encryption keys and avoid cloud backups that the provider can access.

## [Banned C++ features in Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/styleguide/c++/c++-features.md)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 227 | **ID:** 46737447

> **Article:** The article is a link to Chromium's C++ style guide, specifically a document detailing "banned" C++ features. The document lists language features, standard library components, and specific coding patterns that are prohibited within the Chromium codebase. The rationale for these bans includes historical context (the codebase predates certain standards), portability concerns, security vulnerabilities, performance overhead, and the preference for Chromium's own internal, battle-tested libraries over standard library equivalents.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the motivations behind Chromium's restrictive C++ style guide and the broader implications for C++ development. Key themes include:

*   **Historical Context vs. Modern Practice:** Many commenters note that the bans are largely artifacts of Chromium's age and Google's specific engineering culture. Features like `std::chrono` or standard containers are banned not because they are inherently bad, but because Chromium developed its own internal libraries (e.g., `base::Time`) before the standard library matured. There is a consensus that a new project starting today would likely adopt different standards.
*   **The Exception Debate:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the ban of C++ exceptions. Commenters point to Google's official stance: exceptions were banned primarily because the existing massive codebase was not exception-safe, and retrofitting it would be impractical. While some argue exceptions are useful for truly exceptional errors, others acknowledge that for a project of Chromium's scale and history, the ban is a practical necessity.
*   **Language Philosophy and Portability:** Users observed that the bans reflect a desire to maintain a "C-like" style that is easily readable by developers from other language backgrounds and to ensure portability across various platforms. This contrasts with languages like Java or C#, which have evolved to deprecate bad patterns within the language itself, whereas C++ requires manual style enforcement.
*   **Specific Technical Decisions:** The ban on `char8_t` was highlighted as a particularly reasonable rule for most codebases, citing the friction of type incompatibility with existing `char*` APIs. Other bans, such as those on Modules and `std::function`, were attributed to compiler support issues or performance overhead, respectively.
*   **Enforcement and Alternatives:** Commenters discussed how such rules are enforced (static analyzers, custom build tools) and where to find the preferred Chromium alternatives (e.g., `base/files` instead of `<filesystem>`).

## [Man shot and killed by federal agents in south Minneapolis this morning](https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 145 | **ID:** 46745047

> **Article:** The Star Tribune article reports that federal agents shot and killed a man in south Minneapolis during an operation. The article identifies the incident as an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raid. The shooting occurred in a neighborhood known for its large Somali population, a community that has faced criticism from the Trump administration. The article provides the basic facts of the shooting but does not include details about the victim's identity or the specific circumstances leading to the gunfire.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the federal agents' actions and expresses deep concern over the state of civil liberties and federal power. The conversation is dominated by the analysis of videos linked in the comments, which users claim show the victim being pinned to the ground by multiple agents before being shot.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Critique of the Shooting:** Commenters widely describe the event as an "execution" or "summary execution." Several users analyze the linked videos, noting that the victim was tackled by multiple agents and appeared to be subdued before shots were fired. There is skepticism toward the official narrative that the victim was a threat, with users pointing out the lack of body camera footage from the agents involved.
*   **Political Context and ICE's Role:** The discussion frames the incident within the broader political climate of the Trump administration. Users describe ICE agents as "brownshirts" and "thugs," alleging that the agency recruits from white nationalist circles and is being used to target immigrant communities, specifically Somalis in Minneapolis. The conversation connects the shooting to a perceived erosion of due process and the weaponization of federal law enforcement.
*   **Federal vs. State Power:** A significant portion of the debate focuses on the limits of state and local power to intervene. Users question what legal authority Minnesota or Minneapolis has to expel or resist federal agents operating within their borders. The consensus is that local authorities have little recourse, with one user noting that challenging federal jurisdiction is a step that hasn't been tested since the Civil War and would likely lead to rapid escalation.
*   **Lack of Accountability:** There is widespread pessimism about the possibility of justice. Users argue that the Department of Justice and FBI cannot be trusted to conduct an impartial investigation, citing the recent resignation of an FBI agent who suggested a civil rights probe was warranted in a separate ICE-related shooting. The expectation is that the case will be handled by state authorities who may be hampered by federal jurisdiction and a lack of cooperation.
*   **Censorship and HN Culture:** The conversation briefly turns inward, with users noting that the article was quickly flagged and hidden from the main Hacker News front page. This is interpreted by some as a form of censorship, reinforcing the idea that the "active" page shows a more unfiltered version of the community's interests.

## [I Like GitLab](https://www.whileforloop.com/en/blog/2026/01/21/i-like-gitlab/)
**Score:** 160 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46742432

> **Article:** The article "I Like GitLab" is a personal endorsement of GitLab as a comprehensive, all-in-one platform for software development. The author appreciates its unified interface that integrates source code management, CI/CD, issue tracking, and other DevOps features into a single application. The piece highlights the convenience of having everything in one place, contrasting it with the need to assemble a toolchain from disparate services. It also touches on the benefits of self-hosting GitLab for greater control and data privacy, while acknowledging that the platform can be resource-intensive.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a balanced view of GitLab, with users appreciating its all-in-one feature set but frequently criticizing its performance and resource demands, especially for self-hosting. A major theme is the trade-off between GitLab's comprehensive nature and the efficiency of lighter alternatives. Many commenters express a preference for more lightweight, single-purpose tools for personal projects, citing GitLab's slowness and high resource usage on VPSs as significant drawbacks. This has led to a migration towards forks and alternatives like Forgejo and Gitea, which are written in Go, are much faster, and require fewer resources, while still offering core features like CI/CD and issue tracking.

The discussion also highlights a clear divide between corporate and personal use. For larger teams or companies, GitLab's integrated platform and powerful CI/CD are often seen as superior to competitors like Jenkins. However, for individuals or small teams, the complexity and overhead are frequently deemed unnecessary. Specific pain points with GitLab include its slow user interface (especially on merge request views), a proliferation of half-finished features, and a common frustration of encountering old, unresolved bug reports when searching for solutions. The conversation also touches on GitLab's pricing model, with some features (like advanced CI/CD workflows and AI tools) being locked behind premium subscriptions, which contrasts with the fully open-source nature of alternatives like Forgejo.

## [Minnesota activist releases arrest video after manipulated White House version](https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-activist-ice-protest-church-video-49faf3efd54e496388651aac1369fb44)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46739638

> **Article:** The Associated Press article reports that a Minnesota activist, Jarryd Hayne (referred to as Levy Armstrong in the AP piece), released the original arrest video after discovering the White House had published a manipulated version of it. The White House's edit, shared on social media, altered the video to make the activist appear more threatening by darkening their skin tone and exaggerating facial features. The activist released the unaltered footage to counter the misinformation, highlighting the administration's use of altered media to push a specific narrative regarding immigration and crime.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the implications of government-manipulated media, the nature of misinformation, and potential technical solutions. Commenters universally condemned the White House's actions, noting that the alterations were not subtle and specifically included racial elements like darkening the subject's skin tone.

A significant portion of the debate centered on the effectiveness of such manipulation. Users argued that while corrections or "truth reveals" might occur later, they rarely undo the initial damage. Most people consume the initial sensationalized content and either never see the retraction or dismiss it as "old news," meaning the political benefit of the lie often outweighs the cost of being caught. This was described as a calculated "min-max" of outcomes rather than a blunder.

The conversation also touched on the broader erosion of trust in digital media. Several users discussed technical solutions, specifically the C2PA standard and Sony's implementation of cryptographic signing for images at the hardware level. However, skepticism remained regarding adoption and the possibility of bad actors bypassing these safeguards (e.g., signing a screen displaying an AI-generated image).

Finally, commenters drew parallels to authoritarian tactics often attributed to other nations, noting the irony of the U.S. employing similar "meme warfare" strategies. There was also a brief meta-discussion about the article being flagged on HN, with users suggesting that some community members reflexively flag political content regardless of its relevance to technology or media manipulation.

## [Claude Code's new hidden feature: Swarms](https://twitter.com/NicerInPerson/status/2014989679796347375)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46743908

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter post revealing a hidden "Swarms" feature in the latest builds of Anthropic's Claude Code CLI. The feature allows the AI to spawn multiple sub-agents to work on tasks in parallel. It is currently disabled behind a feature flag that requires a backend check to activate. The post notes that users can bypass this restriction by patching the CLI's JavaScript file to remove the check, granting access to the experimental functionality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the technical implementation, security implications, and practical utility of the hidden swarm feature. A key point of concern was a security warning regarding a related third-party tool, claude-flow, which was found to collect extensive telemetry data, including complete conversation histories, source code, and credentials from users' systems. This raised alarms about potential data harvesting across various AI coding assistants.

Technically, commenters clarified that the feature works by using a "delegation mode" where a main "team lead" agent clears its context and delegates tasks to sub-agents. This structure allows sub-agents to operate with fresh, focused contexts, which some argued could lead to more efficient token usage and better reasoning compared to a single agent working within a large, monolithic context. The implementation was described as tightly integrated into the Claude Code harness, distinguishing it from similar third-party tools like GSD or claude-flow.

Opinions on the utility of swarms were mixed. Some users expressed excitement, sharing experiences of using parallel agents to explore codebases, generate reports, and build complex projects with minimal manual intervention. Others were more skeptical, noting that managing a single agent already produces a high volume of code that can be difficult to maintain, and they preferred a more hands-on approach. The conversation also included humorous takes on the feature, with one user satirizing the idea of delegating a simple task like "make this button red" to an entire team of agents.

## [“Let people help” – Advice that made a big difference to a grieving widow](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/20/nx-s1-5683170/let-them-the-small-bit-of-advice-that-made-a-big-difference-to-a-grieving-widow)
**Score:** 142 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46740748

> **Article:** The NPR article tells the story of a widow, Lisa, who was overwhelmed by grief and the logistics of death after her husband's sudden passing. While navigating insurance paperwork, she spoke with a representative who offered a simple piece of advice: "Let people help." This advice shifted Lisa's perspective, encouraging her to accept offers of support from friends and neighbors rather than trying to handle everything alone. The article highlights how this small phrase helped her manage her grief and daily tasks during a difficult period, illustrating the profound impact of accepting community support.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the themes of mutual aid, practical support for the grieving, and the accessibility of the article. A prominent comment shared the Jewish parable of the souls in heaven and hell, both starving despite having the same food and rigid arms; the difference was that in heaven, people fed each other, while in hell, they refused to help their neighbors. This story was widely appreciated for illustrating the necessity of community and reciprocity. Other commenters offered specific, actionable advice for helping those in mourning, such as delivering pre-made meals or performing small chores like cleaning shoes, emphasizing the importance of providing concrete help rather than asking vague questions. There was also a minor thread about the article's format, with users sharing a text-only link and discussing browser "reader modes" for better accessibility. Finally, one commenter expressed frustration that the article ended ambiguously, wanting closure on whether the widow successfully thanked the insurance representative.

## [TikTok is now collecting more data about its users](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46739078

> **Article:** The article from Wired reports on TikTok's updated privacy policy, which now allows the platform to collect more extensive user data. This includes precise location data and other information gathered from devices and apps. The policy change comes as TikTok's US operations are being managed by a new US-based entity, Oracle, which handles American user data. The article highlights ongoing concerns about data privacy and the potential for this information to be misused, framing it within the broader debate about the app's security implications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly pivots from the article's specifics to broader themes of data privacy, government surveillance, and corporate influence. A central point of contention is the perceived threat of data collection. One user argues that they would rather have their data in the hands of the "nebulous 'China'" than an American billionaire aligned with the current US administration, as the latter has more direct avenues to use that data against them. This sentiment is echoed by others who suggest TikTok is a greater security risk after its US sale, and that it's preferable for Americans to use Chinese apps and vice-versa, creating a form of mutual surveillance that minimizes domestic impact.

The conversation also touches on media ownership and propaganda. Commenters express concern over the influence of figures like Larry Ellison on CBS News and draw parallels to the potential for TikTok's US operations to become a tool for state-aligned messaging, with one user noting an anecdotal increase in pro-Trump and far-right content on the platform in Europe.

Finally, the discussion addresses the addictive nature of social media and the difficulty of individual action. While one user presents quitting as the "obvious solution," others counter that this is an unrealistic "hive mind" solution, comparing it to telling people to "have you tried farming?" to solve world hunger. The consensus is that the platforms are intentionally designed to be addictive by exploiting human psychology, and the blame should be placed on the architects of these systems rather than the users who are victims of their design.

## [Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46742635

> **Article:** The linked article from the SQLite website argues that executing many small, separate queries can be more efficient than a single large, complex query, particularly in the context of an embedded database. The core reasoning is that for simple queries, the overhead of the database engine itself is minimal compared to the cost of application-level logic (like string processing) or network latency in client-server databases. The article uses the Fossil SCM's timeline feature as a case study, demonstrating that running dozens of simple queries to fetch user and branch data is faster than a single monolithic join, as the database can perform simple lookups very quickly while the application spends more time formatting the output. The key takeaway is that developers should not fear multiple queries when using SQLite, as the performance bottleneck is often outside the database engine.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the unique architectural advantages of SQLite that make many small queries performant. The central theme is the elimination of network overhead. Multiple commenters point out that even a localhost connection to a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL involves significant overhead from the network stack, kernel transitions, and data serialization, whereas SQLite operates as an embedded library within the application's own process space, making function calls extremely cheap.

There is a debate on the applicability of this principle. While some argue that a single, well-optimized query is always superior for complex analytical tasks, others counter that for the simple record retrievals common in many applications, the difference is negligible and the simplicity of multiple queries is a benefit. Commenters also discuss the trade-offs in database choice, noting that SQLite's primary limitation is write concurrency, not read performance. For applications with many concurrent writers, a switch to a client-server database like PostgreSQL is often necessary. However, for a vast number of use cases, especially those with read-heavy workloads or single-user scenarios, SQLite's performance is more than sufficient and its simplicity is a major advantage. The discussion concludes with an appreciation for SQLite's raw speed, with one user citing benchmarks showing hundreds of thousands of reads per second even on disk.

## [Federal Agents Kill Another Person in Minneapolis Immigration Crackdown](https://time.com/7357547/minneapolis-shooting-ice-agent/)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46745944

> **Article:** A Time.com article reports that federal agents (specifically ICE) shot and killed a person in Minneapolis during an immigration crackdown. The article notes that the individual killed was a U.S. citizen, not an immigrant facing deportation, and that the incident is part of a series of violent confrontations involving federal agents in the area.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of federal law enforcement actions, with commenters framing the incident not as immigration enforcement but as political violence and a symptom of rising fascism. A central point of contention is the victim's status; multiple users emphasize that the deceased was a U.S. citizen, suggesting the crackdown is actually a campaign of intimidation against political dissidents rather than a standard immigration operation. Users express alarm that federal agents are executing citizens, with some linking the violence to the specific context of Minneapolis where local law enforcement limits cooperation with ICE.

There is debate over the scope and motivation of the crackdown, with one user arguing that targeting Minneapolis (rather than states with larger undocumented populations like Texas or Florida) proves the operation is politically motivated. The conversation also touches on the ethical implications for the tech industry, with one commenter stating they can no longer ethically work for U.S. companies due to these events, though this is countered by a view that boycotting a diverse country is an empty gesture. The thread concludes with concerns about the potential for escalating armed conflict between anti-fascist groups and federal agents, with users debating whether nonviolent resistance remains viable.

## [Mental Models (2018)](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)
**Score:** 119 | **Comments:** 20 | **ID:** 46737957

> **Article:** The article "Mental Models: The Best Way to Make Intelligent Decisions" from Farnam Street (fs.blog) serves as a guide to improving decision-making by employing a diverse set of mental models. It argues that relying on a single model or discipline creates a "Man with a Hammer" syndrome, where every problem looks like a nail. Instead, by building a "latticework" of models from various fields—such as physics, biology, psychology, and economics—individuals can view complex problems from multiple angles, leading to more accurate and intelligent conclusions. The article lists and briefly explains 113 models, including concepts like Inversion, Second-Order Thinking, Occam's Razor, and Circle of Competence, emphasizing that the goal is to understand the underlying principles of how the world works to make better judgments in life and business.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the value of the content, the quality of the source website, and the philosophical implications of using mental models. A significant portion of the conversation was meta, focusing on the article's presentation. Several users noted that the 2018 version of the article on the Farnam Street website had been replaced with what they described as an "AI-generated copy of itself," prompting one user to recommend using the Wayback Machine to access the original text. This led to complaints about the site's aggressive pop-ups and "sign-up now" prompts, which some users found intrusive and a reason to abandon the site. Others defended the site, noting that it provides valuable free content.

Beyond the website's presentation, commenters explored the concept of mental models themselves. A key theme was the risk of over-reliance on these simplified frameworks, with one user raising the classic warning of "mistaking the map for the territory." This prompted a discussion on the importance of being aware of the limitations of any model. Another thread distinguished "mental models" from formal "theories," with one user arguing that mental models are more informal, personal, and dynamic, whereas theories are structured, evidence-based, and intended for communal testing. The conversation also touched on the origin of the ideas, with a user pointing out that the concept is heavily based on the work of Charlie Munger and that the site's author, Shane Parrish, is now carrying that torch. Finally, users shared related resources, including Scott E Page's "Model Thinking" course and a book by the same name.

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub-hosted text of Ursula K. Le Guin's "rendition" of the Tao Te Ching. Le Guin notes that this is not a direct translation, as she does not know Chinese, but rather a creative interpretation based on previous translations. The text presents the philosophical verses of the ancient Chinese classic in Le Guin's distinctive literary style.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the nature of translation, the popularity of the Tao Te Ching on Hacker News, and personal reflections on the text. A key point of contention was the copyright status of the linked content, with some users noting that Le Guin's work is not in the public domain and encouraging support for the author.

Users engaged in a nuanced debate about translation, particularly for poetic and ancient texts. Several commenters highlighted that Le Guin herself calls her work a "rendition," not a translation, acknowledging her lack of direct knowledge of Chinese. This sparked a broader conversation about whether perfect translation is possible, with one user comparing different translations to musical "cover versions," each offering a unique interpretation of the same source material. The difficulty of translating the Tao Te Ching even for native Chinese speakers was also mentioned.

Many commenters shared personal connections to the text. One user described its impact as a teenager, contrasting its philosophy of quiet, unseen strength with American values of dominance. Others noted the thematic connections between the Tao and Le Guin's own fiction, such as the *Earthsea* series. The discussion also included recommendations for other translations (like Ken Liu's) and resources for comparing different versions side-by-side.

Finally, the conversation touched on the broader appeal of Taoist philosophy on Hacker News, with a moderator linking to several previous popular discussions on the topic.

## [SEC obtains final consent judgments against former FTX and Alameda executives](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26450)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46740644

> **Article:** The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, FTX co-founder Gary Wang, and former FTX engineering lead Nishad Singh have consented to final judgments following the collapse of FTX. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the executives agreed to permanent injunctions against violating securities laws and are subject to conduct-based injunctions (5 years for Ellison, 8 years for Wang and Singh). Ellison also faces a 10-year officer-and-director bar, while Wang and Singh face 8-year bars. The judgments are pending court approval.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the perceived leniency of the sentences compared to Sam Bankman-Fried's 25-year prison term. Many commenters expressed outrage, viewing the outcome as evidence of a "two-tier justice system" where wealthy or cooperative defendants avoid significant prison time despite their involvement in multi-billion dollar frauds. Several users noted the irony of the situation, with one sarcastically predicting a future Federal Reserve chair for Ellison and another referencing the "master has given Dobby a sock" meme to highlight the executives' freedom.

However, there was a notable counter-argument regarding the necessity of plea deals. Some users defended the reduced sentences as standard legal procedure, emphasizing that cooperation was essential for securing the conviction of the more obstinate Sam Bankman-Fried. A debate also emerged regarding the severity of Ellison's actions, with some commenters arguing that her culpability was mitigated by her position under a "bad boss," while others insisted the entire inner circle was equally guilty.

Secondary points of discussion included:
*   **Factual Clarifications:** Several users corrected the post's title, noting the linked SEC release did not explicitly state Ellison was released from prison (though a Guardian link was provided suggesting a 2026 release date).
*   **Financial Liability:** Users highlighted that despite avoiding prison, Ellison still owes $11 billion to the federal government.
*   **Other Figures:** Commenters questioned the absence of consequences for former FTX co-CEO Sam Trabucco and speculated on whether Donald Trump might pardon SBF in the future.

## [After two years of vibecoding, I'm back to writing by hand [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKTsNV41DYg)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46744572

> **Article:** The linked content is a video titled "After two years of vibecoding, I'm back to writing by hand." The video likely discusses the creator's experience with using AI tools (or "vibecoding") for an extended period and concludes that for certain tasks, manual coding remains superior. The core premise is a critique of over-reliance on AI for code generation, suggesting that for critical, high-quality, or deeply understood work, human-written code is still essential.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a nuanced and balanced view on the role of AI in software development, largely agreeing that while AI tools are powerful, they are not a complete replacement for human expertise. The central theme is the search for a "balance" rather than an all-or-nothing approach.

A key point of agreement is the concept of "responsibility." Commenters emphasize that while AI can generate code, the developer remains responsible for the final product. This leads to a tension where management may push for increased velocity using AI, potentially sacrificing code quality and creating technical debt. Several users warn that "vibe slop" can lead to more time spent on incident response and fixing bugs than would have been spent writing the code correctly in the first place.

The discussion highlights specific use cases where AI excels and where it falls short. Many find AI most useful for automating tedious, non-critical background tasks, writing small scripts, or generating boilerplate code. This allows developers to focus on higher-level architecture and problem-solving. However, there is strong consensus that using AI to implement concepts the developer doesn't fully understand (e.g., complex math or performance-critical systems) is dangerous, as it's impossible to verify the output without the necessary domain knowledge.

Several commenters shared personal experiences, both positive and negative. One described using an agent for a small, well-defined bug fix, which was highly efficient. In contrast, others noted that AI often over-engineers solutions, turning a simple bug fix into a massive, unnecessary refactor, making code harder to review and maintain. Ultimately, the community sees AI as a powerful tool that can increase productivity and make programming more enjoyable, but only when used judiciously by a competent developer who maintains full ownership and understanding of the codebase.

## [Are we all plagiarists now?](https://www.economist.com/culture/2026/01/22/are-we-all-plagiarists-now)
**Score:** 88 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46744968

> **Article:** The article "Are we all plagiarists now?" from The Economist explores the impact of generative AI on the concepts of originality, plagiarism, and intellectual property. It argues that the ease with which AI can ingest, remix, and reproduce vast amounts of existing human work is blurring the lines of what constitutes plagiarism. The piece touches on the commercial pressures driving this change, the difficulty in detecting AI-generated text, and the philosophical question of whether true originality ever truly existed, citing historical examples of derivative works like *Paradise Lost*. The central theme is that AI is forcing a societal re-evaluation of creativity, attribution, and the value of human effort in the face of machine-generated content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and multifaceted debate about the nature of creativity, ownership, and the economic impact of AI. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes.

A central point of contention is the fundamental value of intellectual property. One user argues that all creative work is inherently derivative and that every generation reinterprets the legacy of human thought, suggesting that ideas, once released into the world, become part of a shared cultural wilds. This view is supported by another who points out that even canonical works like *Paradise Lost* are essentially "fan fiction" of the Bible, questioning the modern obsession with complete originality. The sentiment "Good artists copy, great artists steal" is invoked to frame creativity as an act of synthesis rather than pure invention.

However, this optimistic view of creative freedom is challenged by economic and systemic realities. Several commenters argue that the core issue is not plagiarism itself, but a capitalist system that demands individuals commodify their creativity. One user notes that AI's ability to perfectly copy a creator's style threatens their livelihood, while another warns that weakening creators' rights primarily benefits distributors and "middlemen," who stand to capture the majority of the economic value from AI-driven content. This leads to a discussion on whether strengthening or reforming copyright (e.g., making rights non-transferable) could protect artists from being exploited by platforms.

The practical and ethical implications of AI are also heavily debated. On one hand, there's a sense of violation; one user describes the feeling of having one's work ingested and re-iterated by a machine without attribution. On the other hand, there's a counter-argument that this process facilitates the massive, rapid dissemination of ideas to billions, potentially accelerating innovation. A related concern is the "flood" of mediocre content that AI enables, devaluing the work of skilled creators and overwhelming the information ecosystem. The discussion also touches on the reliability of AI detection tools, with users debating whether a 90% success rate is sufficient and noting that detectors are often tuned to minimize false positives at the expense of catching all AI-generated text.

Ultimately, the discussion reflects a clash between two perspectives: one that sees AI as the next logical step in the long history of cultural remixing and knowledge sharing, and another that views it as a disruptive force that threatens creative livelihoods, devalues human effort, and disproportionately benefits corporate intermediaries.

## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 87 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** BirdyChat, a chat application from Latvia, has announced it is the first European app to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp. This is enabled by the new Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU, which mandates that large "gatekeeper" platforms like WhatsApp open their services to competitors. The feature allows BirdyChat users in the European Economic Area (EEA) to start chats with WhatsApp users in the region simply by using their phone number.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical limitations of the new feature and the broader debate over open versus proprietary messaging protocols.

A primary point of contention was the implementation details. Several users noted that WhatsApp's interoperability is an opt-in feature for its users, which many believe severely limits its practical adoption and effectiveness. There was also skepticism about BirdyChat itself, with one commenter suggesting it and another app were "hand-picked" by Meta for "malicious compliance" to create the appearance of openness without fostering real competition.

The conversation frequently pivoted to the long-standing desire for open messaging standards. One commenter passionately lamented the decline of open protocols like IRC and XMPP, arguing that proprietary systems have fragmented communication. Others countered that the market has consistently favored the superior features and user experience of closed platforms like WhatsApp and iMessage over the principles of open standards.

Finally, users discussed the implications for other platforms, particularly Apple's iMessage. While some hoped the EU's DMA would force Apple to open iMessage, it was clarified that iMessage has so far been exempted from the "gatekeeper" designation. A debate also emerged about whether iMessage is truly closed, with one user pointing to its integration with SMS as a form of interoperability.
