# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-22

## [EU–INC – A new pan-European legal entity](https://www.eu-inc.org/)
**Score:** 708 | **Comments:** 660 | **ID:** 46703763

> **Article:** The article links to a proposal for "EU-Inc," a new pan-European legal entity championed by EU leadership. The goal is to create a single, simple set of rules for companies to operate seamlessly across all EU member states. Key features include the ability to register a company online in any member state within 48 hours, a harmonized capital regime with no minimum capital requirement (unlike the existing Societas Europaea), and a streamlined digital ecosystem for management and compliance. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to create a more integrated European economy, alongside a deeper capital markets union and an affordable, interconnected energy market. The aim is to make scaling businesses in the EU as frictionless as in markets like the US or China, thereby attracting global investment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of optimism, skepticism, and regional nuance regarding the EU-Inc proposal. The conversation is largely centered on the practical realities of starting and running a business within the current fragmented European landscape.

A key theme is the divergence of opinion on how difficult it is to incorporate a company in the EU. One commenter from Germany describes the process as a "nightmare," expressing strong hope that EU-Inc will bring agility and reduce friction. However, others from Sweden and Spain counter that this is a "German problem," sharing their own experiences of setting up companies online with minimal bureaucracy. A self-employed electrician from Bavaria adds that while starting as a small business is straightforward, scaling to a GmbH (a common German legal form) is where complexity increases, suggesting the real value of EU-Inc might be in facilitating growth and cross-border operations, not just initial setup.

Several commenters clarify the proposal's status and compare it to existing structures. It's noted that the initiative is not yet adopted but is expected to be proposed soon, with a potential implementation by 2027 after a lengthy legislative process. A direct comparison is made to the Societas Europaea (SE), with EU-Inc being highlighted as more accessible due to its lack of a €120,000 minimum capital requirement and its simplified, digitally-native governance.

Broader skepticism is also present. One commenter argues that the core challenge isn't incorporating a company but rather the ongoing burden of regulations. Another raises a significant concern about the legal implementation, suggesting that if EU-Inc is passed as a "directive" (requiring national implementation) rather than a "regulation" (directly applicable law), it could lead to 27 different interpretations, undermining its goal of uniformity.

Finally, the discussion briefly touches on related EU policies mentioned in the source material. A comment on the proposed energy union is met with a negative reaction from a Swede, who calls past EU energy unification "catastrophic" for prices and the environment. Another comment on the EU-Mercosur trade deal is initially positive but is quickly corrected by a user pointing out that the deal is currently frozen pending a legal challenge.

## [Show HN: ChartGPU – WebGPU-powered charting library (1M points at 60fps)](https://github.com/ChartGPU/ChartGPU)
**Score:** 527 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46706528

> **Project:** ChartGPU is a new open-source JavaScript library for 2D data visualization that leverages WebGPU to render high-performance charts. It is capable of rendering 1 million data points at 60fps. The project is currently in early development (v0.1) and focuses on time-series, financial, and dashboard charts. It is licensed under MIT.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to ChartGPU was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising its performance and smoothness. Several technical discussions and bug reports emerged:

*   **Performance & Hardware:** Users on high-end hardware (e.g., RTX Pro 6000) reported excellent frame rates (165 fps). A suggestion was made to add a built-in benchmarking tool to easily compare performance across different machines.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** A major topic was WebGPU support. While Chrome users found it worked well (sometimes requiring specific flags on Linux), Firefox users faced significant hurdles. WebGPU is currently only fully supported on Firefox for Windows, requiring manual flag toggling on other platforms. Android support was confirmed for newer devices, though some users needed to update their browsers.
*   **Bug Reports:** Users identified specific issues, including:
    *   Broken scrollbars/momentum scrolling on macOS (M1) and Windows 11.
    *   Non-functional time-frame buttons in the candlestick streaming demo.
    *   Lack of Firefox support out-of-the-box.
*   **Feature Requests:** Key requests included:
    *   **Worker Thread Support:** A user requested support for `OffscreenCanvas` to run the library entirely in a Web Worker, which the developer identified as a priority for the v0.2 roadmap.
    *   **Monetization:** One user encouraged the creator to consider a "pro" tier for enterprise features to ensure the project's long-term sustainability.
*   **Developer Response:** The developer was highly responsive, acknowledging bugs, providing immediate workarounds, and engaging with feature requests by adding them to the public roadmap.

## [cURL removes bug bounties](https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html)
**Score:** 413 | **Comments:** 241 | **ID:** 46701733

> **Article:** The article reports that the cURL project has discontinued its bug bounty program on HackerOne. The decision was made by project maintainer Daniel Stenberg due to an overwhelming influx of low-quality, automated, and nonsensical vulnerability reports, which he refers to as "slop." These reports, likely generated by AI tools, waste significant time and resources, making the program unsustainable for the open-source project.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters sharing similar experiences and analyzing the broader implications. The consensus is that AI has enabled a flood of low-effort, automated spam that is overwhelming open-source security programs.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **The Nature of the "Slop":** Multiple users examined the linked examples of poor-quality reports, concluding they are likely AI-generated or from individuals with no real understanding of security. They note the reports often misunderstand basic software behavior, propose nonsensical "fixes," or flag non-existent vulnerabilities.
*   **Shared Experiences:** Several commenters, including those managing security for other companies, confirmed they face the same problem. They receive dozens or hundreds of spam emails daily, filled with AI-generated "pentest" reports containing false positives and impossible findings (e.g., a Windows IIS bug on a GCP server), rendering their security intake channels useless.
*   **Proposed Solutions and Counterarguments:**
    *   **Entry Fees:** A popular suggestion was to implement a small, refundable entry fee for submissions. This would create a financial barrier to stop spammers. However, others worried this might deter legitimate, low-income researchers and that determining a "reasonable" vulnerability is subjective.
    *   **AI vs. AI:** The idea of using AI to filter out AI-generated slop was mentioned, but it was met with skepticism and sarcasm, highlighting the "cat-and-mouse" nature of the problem.
    *   **Human Problem:** Some argued the issue isn't the tool (AI) but the human incentive to spam for potential gain, a problem that existed before LLMs but has been massively amplified.
*   **Broader Impact on Open Source:** A significant theme was the negative impact of AI on the open-source ecosystem. One commenter argued that open source, which helped train the models, is now being exploited by them—both through spam and potentially by being replaced. The discussion touched on how AI could erode open-source business models and lead to a flood of low-quality, AI-generated code contributions.
*   **Motivations Beyond Money:** One user speculated that even without bounties, the "promotional" value of being able to list thousands of submitted reports might continue to drive some of the spam, as it can be used to feign expertise.

## [Tell HN: Bending Spoons laid off almost everybody at Vimeo yesterday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707699)
**Score:** 360 | **Comments:** 361 | **ID:** 46707699

> **Post:** A user on Hacker News reported that Bending Spoons, the acquirer of Vimeo, has laid off almost all of the company's staff. The post serves as a notification of a significant workforce reduction at the video hosting platform following its recent acquisition.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focused on Bending Spoons' aggressive acquisition and restructuring model, drawing parallels to its previous purchase of Evernote. Commenters noted a consistent pattern: acquiring a company, drastically cutting staff, rewriting the product with a small team, and restricting free tiers to increase profitability. While some users expressed concern that this approach prioritizes short-term cost-cutting over long-term growth and community trust, others acknowledged that it allows the company to ship features faster.

Specific concerns were raised regarding the impact on Vimeo's existing customers and partners. Users highlighted that Vimeo hosts critical services like Dropout and Mystery Science Theater 3000, and expressed fear that the platform's reliability and terms of service would deteriorate. Several long-time users announced they were canceling their subscriptions due to rising prices and uncertainty about the platform's future. The conversation also touched on the fate of open-source projects associated with Vimeo, such as the Psalm static analyzer for PHP, though the project's creator confirmed it is currently maintained independently.

## [Claude's new constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution)
**Score:** 351 | **Comments:** 354 | **ID:** 46707572

> **Article:** Anthropic announced a new "constitution" for its AI model, Claude, which serves as a core set of principles guiding its behavior and training. The constitution is designed to be transparent, allowing users to understand the intended behaviors of the AI. It is used not just as a static set of rules but is actively integrated into the training process, where Claude itself helps generate synthetic training data based on these principles. The document outlines values such as being helpful, honest, and harmless, but also includes more nuanced concepts like avoiding "broadly harmful" outcomes and considering Claude's own "welfare" or potential moral status. The goal is to create a more steerable and trustworthy AI by formalizing the system's core directives.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revealed a deeply divided and skeptical community regarding Anthropic's announcement. The conversation centered on several key themes:

A significant portion of the comments expressed cynicism, viewing the constitution as a public relations stunt. Some users dismissed it as a marketing rebrand of a standard system prompt, a legal "CYA" strategy for the company, or fearmongering designed to hype up AI capabilities. The language used in the constitution, which refers to Claude as a "novel kind of entity" and discusses its potential "welfare" and "happiness," was a major point of contention. Many commenters found this level of anthropomorphism concerning, with some stating it made them reconsider working for the company.

In contrast, a smaller group defended the initiative as a practical and necessary step for AI development. They argued that formalizing the model's principles is crucial for steering its behavior during training, not just at inference time. These users pointed to the technical details in the announcement, explaining that the constitution is used to generate synthetic data for training, making it a functional part of the model's architecture rather than just a superficial document.

Other discussions touched on the political implications of a private company defining a model's "ethics," with one user sarcastically referencing a hypothetical future where a model might be required to prioritize a president's ideals. There was also a technical debate about the use of the term "broadly safe" and "broadly ethical," with some interpreting it as a necessary trade-off to prevent the AI from being overly cautious and unhelpful, while others saw it as a lack of genuine commitment. Finally, some users connected the public constitution to a previously leaked internal document, confirming its authenticity.

## [Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/)
**Score:** 349 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46709727

> **Article:** The article links to the Linux from Scratch (LFS) project website, which provides a step-by-step book for building a custom Linux system entirely from source code. The process involves compiling the GNU toolchain, the Linux kernel, and essential system libraries and utilities to create a functional, minimalist operating system.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on Linux from Scratch (LFS) as a foundational educational experience rather than a practical daily-use distribution. Commenters widely praise it as the best method for understanding the inner workings of a Linux system, demystifying the "magic" behind how components like the kernel, compiler, and libraries fit together. Many shared nostalgic stories of completing LFS in their youth, noting that the persistence and time required were more manageable as teenagers.

Key themes include the trade-off between time investment and knowledge gained. While commenters acknowledge that modern software stacks (e.g., LLVM, systemd) have made the process more complex and time-consuming (often taking 8+ hours), they still recommend it for deep learning. Alternatives like Gentoo or Arch were mentioned as providing similar educational value with less effort. The conversation also touched on the feasibility of using LLMs to automate bespoke distro creation, though many argued the primary value of LFS is the hands-on human learning process, not the final product—which most users abandon for maintained distributions like Slackware or Ubuntu after the exercise.

## [Skip is now free and open source](https://skip.dev/blog/skip-is-free/)
**Score:** 315 | **Comments:** 145 | **ID:** 46706906

> **Article:** The article announces that Skip, a tool for building native cross-platform apps for iOS and Android using a single Swift codebase, is now free and open source. The tool works by translating SwiftUI code into native Jetpack Compose for Android, allowing developers to share logic while maintaining platform-specific UIs. The company's rationale is that developer tools need to be free to achieve mass adoption, and they believe the timing is right given recent industry shifts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive but highlights several practical concerns and questions. A primary technical concern was the licensing ambiguity of the main repository, which was quickly addressed by the maintainers adding an LGPL3 license. Users are curious about the tool's accessibility features, with the developer confirming that Skip supports native accessibility frameworks (VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android) because it uses the platforms' native UI toolkits.

There is significant interest in the tool's resource requirements, with the recommendation of 32GB of RAM sparking some surprise; the developer clarified this is due to running both iOS and Android development environments simultaneously, not Skip itself. While some users expressed a desire for Windows support, it is not currently available. The conversation also touched on the broader economic challenges of selling developer tools, with one user sharing a personal anecdote about the difficulty of monetizing software in the current market. Finally, there is a demand for examples of famous apps built with Skip to validate its real-world viability.

## [Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/)
**Score:** 295 | **Comments:** 258 | **ID:** 46713924

> **Article:** The article, authored by a group of computer scientists and security experts, argues that internet voting is inherently insecure and should not be used in public elections. The core thesis is that the fundamental challenges of securing remote voting systems against malware, network attacks, and privacy violations cannot be solved with current technology. The authors contend that the risks of undetectable manipulation, voter coercion, and privacy breaches outweigh any potential benefits of convenience or speed. They advocate for the continued use of paper ballots, which provide a tangible, auditable record that can be publicly verified, and recommend that any electronic systems used (like ballot scanners) remain isolated from the internet to maintain election integrity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of internet voting and largely supportive of the article's conclusions. The dominant sentiment favors traditional paper-based systems, valuing trust and auditability over efficiency and convenience.

A primary theme is the strong endorsement of paper ballots. Multiple commenters, including one from Australia, describe paper systems as reliable, scalable, and trusted. They highlight features like public oversight, manual recounts, and the physical separation of voting from the internet as key strengths. This perspective is reinforced by references to other successful paper-based systems, such as in India, and a shared nostalgia for the simplicity of paper, even referencing past issues like "hanging chads" as a preferable problem to the opaque risks of digital systems.

Conversely, Estonia's pioneering internet voting system is frequently cited as a cautionary tale. Commenters point to research (specifically the estoniaevoting.org project) that highlights significant security vulnerabilities, suggesting that even a digitally advanced nation has not solved the core problems. This serves as a real-world example to bolster the argument that internet voting is fundamentally flawed.

The discussion also explores the tension between security and accessibility. One commenter posits that while efficiency is not a primary goal for elections, some level of technological improvement could potentially increase voter turnout. However, this is a minority view, with the majority prioritizing the sanctity of the vote count over ease of participation.

Finally, the conversation touches on related concepts like cryptographic tokens and verifiable voting. While some propose a centralized, secure identity management system as a potential foundation for electronic voting, others immediately raise concerns about coercion and privacy, arguing that a system verifiably tied to an individual is dangerous. The discussion concludes with a general consensus that the primary goal of an election system is public trust, which current internet voting models fail to inspire.

## [How AI destroys institutions](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-ai-destroys-institutions/)
**Score:** 292 | **Comments:** 252 | **ID:** 46705606

> **Article:** The article, "How AI Destroys Institutions," argues that AI, particularly generative AI, undermines the core functions of purpose-driven institutions like universities, hospitals, and courts. The author posits that these institutions exist to manage complexity, reduce chaos, and create stable, predictable patterns of behavior. AI disrupts this by offering frictionless, on-demand access to information and capabilities, which erodes the need for the structured, expert-led processes that institutions provide. This devalues institutional authority and expertise, potentially leading to their decay as individuals bypass them for immediate AI-driven solutions, thereby losing the intellectual rigor and communal standards these institutions are designed to foster.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was highly critical and multifaceted, focusing less on the article's specific arguments and more on its perceived flaws and the broader context of AI and institutional trust.

A primary theme was the questioning of the article's academic rigor. Several commenters dismissed it as an "opinion piece" rather than a substantiated academic paper, citing a lack of proper citations, reliance on anecdotes, and the use of a non-peer-reviewed draft. One commenter specifically critiqued its use of a secondary, inaccurate news report to support a claim about the FDA's use of AI, suggesting the research was shallow.

Another significant thread addressed the article's title and framing. Some found the title sensationalist and off-putting, while others accused the author of creating a strawman argument by not acknowledging that institutions themselves may be failing, thus creating the demand for alternatives like AI. The argument was made that institutional trust is already low in areas like media, medicine, and education, making AI an attractive, if flawed, substitute for expensive or inaccessible expert services.

Finally, the discussion broadened to the nature of technological disruption itself. Some viewed this as an inevitable byproduct of any major revolution, while others argued that institutions were already "fatally wounded" by previous technologies like social media, positioning AI as just the latest accelerant in a longer-term decline. A few commenters also touched on the philosophical limitations of social science compared to "hard science," questioning the very foundation of such institutional critiques.

## [Scientists find a way to regrow cartilage in mice and human tissue samples](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm)
**Score:** 270 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46709179

> **Article:** A study led by Stanford Medicine researchers has discovered that blocking a protein linked to aging can reverse the natural loss of knee cartilage in older mice. The treatment involves an injection that inhibits 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), a protein that accumulates with age and suppresses cartilage regeneration. The research, published in *Science*, also demonstrated successful cartilage regrowth in human tissue samples. Phase 1 clinical trials for a related inhibitor are already underway for muscle weakness, with researchers hoping to launch similar trials for cartilage regeneration soon.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was a mix of cautious optimism, skepticism, and personal anecdotes. A recurring theme was the perennial frustration that promising medical breakthroughs are frequently demonstrated in mice but not yet in humans, with users humorously noting that mice are the "overlords" of scientific research. However, several commenters provided context that tempered this skepticism, noting that the underlying mechanism is already being tested in human trials for other conditions (like muscle weakness), which could accelerate the path to a cartilage treatment.

Other key points included:
*   **Cautious Realism:** Users emphasized the long timeline (5-10 years for success, potentially 20-30 for affordability) and the low success rate of mouse studies translating to human trials.
*   **Medical Nuance:** Commenters distinguished between different types of joint issues, clarifying that osteoarthritis (mechanical wear) is the target, while rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune) is a different condition. There was also discussion on the difference between uncontrolled cell growth (cancer) and the regulated regeneration targeted by this therapy.
*   **Personal Impact:** Several users shared personal stories of joint pain and expressed deep hope for this technology, particularly for runners and those who have undergone painful surgeries. One user offered alternative paths to the "runner's high" through meditation or swimming.
*   **Broader Context:** The conversation touched on the "year of" phenomenon (similar to "Year of the Linux Desktop") for breakthroughs like fusion power and cartilage regrowth, and some philosophical speculation on whether aging is a pre-programmed process.

## [SETI@home is in hiberation](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 134 | **ID:** 46703301

> **Article:** The article links to the SETI@home website, which announces that the project is now in hibernation. The project, which utilized distributed computing to analyze radio telescope data for extraterrestrial signals, has stopped issuing new work units and is no longer processing data. This follows the completion of the project's data analysis, with final results recently published in a scientific paper.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely nostalgic, with many users reminiscing about running SETI@home as a screensaver on older computers like the Pentium II and feeling a sense of scientific contribution in their youth. Several commenters express a fondness for the era when SETI@home and shows like *The X-Files* fueled public interest in extraterrestrial mysteries.

While some initially questioned the project's outcome, others clarified that the hibernation is a result of the project's completion, with recent scientific papers published based on the data collected. The conversation also pivoted to other distributed computing projects, with Folding@home being mentioned as an ongoing alternative. Users also discussed the evolution of computing, noting how the decline of screensavers and the rise of specialized hardware have changed the landscape of volunteer computing.

## [Stories removed from the Hacker News Front Page, updated in real time (2024)](https://github.com/vitoplantamura/HackerNewsRemovals)
**Score:** 239 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46704555

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository that tracks stories removed from the Hacker News front page in real time. The project provides a transparent log of moderation actions, showing which posts were flagged or removed, aiming to shed light on the curation process of the popular tech forum.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the nature of moderation, the role of politics on a tech forum, and community sentiment toward the HN platform. A significant portion of the debate revolves around whether political content should be allowed. Some users express fatigue with the prevalence of LLM and political news, arguing that HN should focus on "interesting" technology rather than partisan topics. Conversely, others contend that technology and politics are inextricably linked, and that ignoring the political implications of tech developments (such as Musk's influence or government regulation) is dangerous and stifles necessary debate.

Users also debated the mechanics of moderation. While some criticized the "mass flagging" of stories—suggesting it silences important debates—others defended the flagging system as a necessary tool to maintain quality and filter out duplicates or low-value content. There was a call from some users for more transparency in the flagging process, such as seeing who flagged a post, to identify potential bias or coordinated censorship. Despite these critiques, there was a strong undercurrent of appreciation for the human moderation team (specifically "dang"), with many users acknowledging that the site's quality is maintained through their efforts.

## [Waiting for dawn in search: Search index, Google rulings and impact on Kagi](https://blog.kagi.com/waiting-dawn-search)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 149 | **ID:** 46708678

> **Article:** The Kagi blog post "Waiting for dawn in search" outlines the immense difficulty and cost of building a modern search engine. The author argues that the search index is a "parallel national railroad" in terms of infrastructure investment, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to compete with Google on equal footing. The post details the barriers to entry, including Google's refusal to license its core search API for whitelabeling (forcing competitors to rely on ad-syndication models) and the sheer scale of data processing required. Kagi positions itself as a premium, ad-free alternative that must navigate these constraints, likely using a combination of third-party APIs and its own small-web index to provide results while focusing on user experience and AI integration.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the technical and ethical implications of Kagi's business model, the feasibility of breaking Google's monopoly, and the accuracy of the article's data.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on Kagi's reliance on third-party providers (like SerpAPI) to access Google's search results. Commenters express surprise that Kagi admits to this, with some viewing it as "stealing" or scraping Google's data to resell, while others defend it as standard business practice in an industry where direct licensing is unavailable. There is concern regarding user privacy; even if Kagi doesn't log queries, they are still sent to Google and subject to its privacy policies. Additionally, users questioned the vague description of Kagi's "own small-web index," speculating it might be minimal or misleading.

The conversation also explores the difficulty of competing with Google. While some argued that Google's dominance is simply a result of being the best product, others countered that monopolies prevent meaningful competition regardless of quality. The analogy of building a "parallel national railroad" was frequently cited, with commenters debating why big tech companies haven't collaborated to build an open search index similar to how they collaborated on AI training datasets. The consensus was that Google's entrenched market position and brand recognition ("Google" as a verb) create a barrier that technology alone cannot easily overcome.

Finally, there was a minor thread criticizing the article's claim that Google serves 90% of the "world" search traffic, with users pointing out that this statistic ignores regions where Google is blocked (like China), making the data US-centric rather than global.

## [Ireland wants to give its cops spyware, ability to crack encrypted messages](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/ireland_wants_to_give_police/)
**Score:** 213 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46705715

> **Article:** The article reports that the Irish government is seeking to introduce legislation that would grant its police force, the Gardaí, new powers to use spyware and technical methods to crack encrypted messages. This move is part of a broader trend among Western governments to expand surveillance capabilities in the digital age, citing the need to combat serious crime. The proposal has raised significant concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and the potential for government overreach.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the proposed legislation, with commenters expressing deep skepticism and frustration. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A central argument is that this is a fundamentally political and social problem, not a technical one. Users argue that even if strong, unbreakable encryption exists, governments can simply legislate to compel companies to create backdoors or criminalize the use of such technology, thereby negating any cryptographic security. This shifts the debate from a technical cat-and-mouse game to a question of rights and political will.

There is widespread cynicism regarding the government's justification for these powers. Commenters point to a perceived lack of police effectiveness in traditional duties, citing examples like the Romanian kidnapping case and the established legal precedent in the US that police have no specific duty to protect individuals. This leads to the belief that these new powers are not for public safety but for expanding state control and surveillance. The focus on a "cyberpolice force" is seen as a misallocation of resources, especially given Ireland's reported shortage of regular police officers.

The discussion frames this as part of a global, coordinated trend. Multiple users note that similar measures are being pursued in many countries simultaneously, viewing it as a systemic erosion of digital rights and an attempt by governments to maintain control in an increasingly decentralized technological landscape. The move is compared to the actions of intelligence agencies like the NSA and seen as a step toward turning national police forces into domestic surveillance bodies.

Finally, there is a strong sense of resignation and inevitability. Some commenters see this as a continuation of a long-running battle between privacy and state power ("always has been"), while others express despair that the public will not effectively resist these encroachments on their rights.

## [The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns](https://www.nibzard.com/agentic-handbook)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46701969

> **Article:** The article "The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns" is a comprehensive guide that consolidates various techniques and patterns for building and managing AI agents, particularly in coding and development contexts. It aims to standardize the vocabulary and strategies for agentic workflows, covering topics like agent coordination, prompt engineering, and handling common failure modes. The resource is presented as a website and an open-source GitHub repository, serving as a reference for developers navigating the emerging field of AI-assisted programming.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant divide between optimism and skepticism regarding the practical utility of agentic AI. Proponents view the handbook as a valuable resource for standardizing terminology and learning best practices, comparing it to established methodologies like Test-Driven Development (TDD). They argue that the current difficulties are part of a learning curve and that such guides are essential for harnessing the technology effectively.

However, a substantial portion of the comments express deep frustration and skepticism. Critics highlight the high "cognitive cost" of managing agents, arguing that the effort spent preventing agents from making errors or going off-track often outweighs the time saved. This sentiment is captured in the view that the "pipe dream" of fully automated issue-to-PR workflows frequently becomes a "nightmare" of fixing downstream regressions. Several users dismiss the article and the broader trend as "snake oil" or hype, suggesting that the field is filled with over-optimism and grifting, especially given the immense capital invested in AI with limited real-world results.

Other key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Practical Advice vs. Over-Engineering:** While some users shared practical tips (e.g., forcing agents to explain their reasoning before taking irreversible actions), others felt the entire ecosystem is over-complicated. The consensus among many experienced users was to stick to simpler tools like direct prompting in Claude Code rather than adopting complex agent frameworks or specialized IDEs.
*   **AI-Generated Content:** A meta-discussion emerged about the prevalence of AI-generated articles, with some commenters accusing the handbook of being AI-slop. This led to a debate on whether such accusations are constructive or have become a tiresome reflex on the platform.
*   **Credibility and Commercial Interests:** Skepticism was also directed at the author's potential biases and the commercial motives behind similar "pattern" guides, with one commenter noting a linked resource was essentially a marketing tool for their company.

## [Nested code fences in Markdown](https://susam.net/nested-code-fences.html)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46705201

> **Article:** The article explains how to nest code fences in Markdown. It clarifies that a code fence can be opened with any number of backticks or tildes (minimum three) and must be closed with the exact same number of delimiters. To nest a code block, one simply uses a fence with more delimiters than the outer block. For example, a code block enclosed in four backticks can contain an inner code block enclosed in three backticks. This rule allows for arbitrary levels of nesting.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the usability and design of Markdown's nesting syntax, with a mix of practical advice and broader critiques of the language.

Several users expressed frustration with the complexity and ambiguity of Markdown's specification. One commenter described Markdown's parser as a "fascinating anomaly" consisting of "exceptions and corner cases," while another noted that the original Markdown lacked a formal specification, leading to the creation of CommonMark. The core design of code fences was also criticized; one user argued that using the same symbol (backticks or tildes) for both opening and closing is inherently flawed, proposing a distinct start and end marker (e.g., `[[[lang` and `]]]`) for a more robust and simpler parser.

Practical applications and workarounds were a common theme. Users shared that this nesting technique is essential for embedding code snippets within documentation, especially when using LLMs or platforms like GitHub (e.g., for code suggestions in comments). One user noted that using a unique delimiter like `---` for their own language was a deliberate choice to avoid Markdown's nesting issues, though another pointed out that `---` is already used for horizontal rules in Markdown. Alternatives like using raw HTML tags (`<pre>`, `<code>`) or other markup languages like Org-mode were also mentioned as ways to sidestep the problem entirely.

A separate point was raised about the trade-offs of delimiter-based systems versus length-prefixing. One commenter suggested that length-prefixing content makes parsing easier and avoids the quoting and escaping complexities inherent in delimiter-based designs like Markdown.

## [The percentage of Show HN posts is increasing, but their scores are decreasing](https://snubi.net/posts/Show-HN/)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46702099

> **Article:** The article analyzes data from Hacker News to show that while the percentage of posts tagged with "Show HN" has been steadily increasing over the years, the average score of these posts has been decreasing. The author suggests this indicates a decline in the perceived quality or community reception of Show HN submissions, potentially due to an increase in lower-quality projects.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by the sentiment that the quality of Show HN submissions has declined, largely due to the proliferation of low-effort AI projects. Many commenters express "AI fatigue," noting that the feed is saturated with generic "agentic" tools and LLM-generated applications, which drown out more unique or substantive projects. This has led to a perception that the "Show HN" prefix has lost its value, as genuine engagement is harder to achieve amidst the noise.

A key theme is the changing purpose of Show HN. While some argue it has devolved into a marketing funnel for startups and "vibe-coded slop," a moderator (tomhow) clarifies that the team is actively trying to push it back towards its original goal: showcasing deep, innovative work that others can learn from, rather than being a platform for product launches.

Commenters also explored the broader implications. Some believe the ease of creation with AI is devaluing software in general, making marketing and trust the new bottlenecks. Others noted that the decline in average scores could be a statistical artifact of a larger volume of submissions (a long-tail effect), but agreed that the influx of low-quality content is overwhelming the good. There was also a technical observation that Show HN posts are placed in a separate, lower-traffic section ("shownew"), which inherently limits their visibility compared to regular submissions.

## [Swedish Alecta has sold off an estimated $8B of US Treasury Bonds](https://www.di.se/nyheter/di-avslojar-alecta-har-dumpat-amerikanska-statspapper/)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46705256

> **Article:** The article reports that Swedish pension fund Alecta has sold off an estimated $8 billion in US Treasury bonds. While the specific reasons for this divestment are not detailed in the provided text, the discussion strongly suggests it is part of a broader trend of European institutional investors reducing their exposure to US debt, potentially due to political concerns, risk management, or a shift in investment strategy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the significance of this sale, with a clear divide between viewing it as a minor financial event and a potentially significant symbolic or directional shift.

A primary theme was the debate over the sale's market impact. Many commenters argued that $8 billion is a negligible amount relative to the total US Treasury market, calling it "symbolic" or a "drop in the ocean." They pointed out that such a small sale would be easily absorbed by other buyers. However, others countered that every sale, no matter the size, reduces demand and puts downward pressure on bond prices (and upward pressure on yields). They argued that while this single event is minor, it could be part of a larger trend of de-dollarization or a reduction in foreign demand, which would have more substantial long-term consequences for US borrowing costs.

The discussion also explored the broader context of European funds divesting from US Treasuries. Commenters noted similar recent actions by Danish pension funds, suggesting this is not an isolated incident. A key point was the lack of viable alternatives. While some suggested reinvesting in European assets, gold, or other currencies, others highlighted that the European bond market is not as deep or unified as the US market, making a large-scale shift difficult. The absence of a large, liquid "Eurobond" market to rival US Treasuries was identified as a major structural barrier for Europe.

Finally, the conversation touched on the potential motivations behind such sales. While the article itself doesn't specify a reason, commenters speculated it could be a response to US politics, a hedge against perceived risks in the US market, or a strategic realignment. The symbolic nature of the act was considered important, with some suggesting it could be the start of a larger movement, while others dismissed it as irrelevant noise.

## [Can you slim macOS down?](https://eclecticlight.co/2026/01/21/can-you-slim-macos-down/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 235 | **ID:** 46702411

> **Article:** The article "Can you slim macOS down?" explores the user's desire to reduce the size and resource footprint of macOS, particularly for use on servers or in virtual machines. The author concludes that while some minor trimming is possible (e.g., removing language packs, unused drivers), a truly minimal, headless installation of macOS is not feasible. Apple has designed the OS as a monolithic, integrated system where core components are interdependent and cannot be safely removed. The article notes that macOS has a Unix certification, but emphasizes that it is a proprietary, closed-source operating system, distinct from traditional open-source Unix-like systems. Ultimately, the author suggests that for users needing a lightweight, controllable OS on Apple hardware, switching to a Linux distribution is the only viable path.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's conclusion, expressing frustration with macOS's lack of customization and exploring alternatives. A central theme is the comparison between macOS and Linux. One user questions what macOS offers power users that Linux doesn't, given the trade-off in system control. The primary benefits cited for macOS are superior battery life and power management on Apple hardware, as well as access to specific high-quality applications like Pixelmator Pro.

The conversation then delves into the nature of macOS itself. One user points out that macOS is officially Unix-certified, contradicting the article's claim that it "isn't Unix." This is countered by the argument that the certified version differs from what consumers run and that, regardless, its proprietary nature sets it apart from traditional Unix systems. The locked-down nature of modern macOS is compared unfavorably to Windows, though most agree macOS is still the more pleasant experience.

Practical use cases are also discussed. A user expresses a need for a slimmed-down macOS for CI/VM environments, highlighting the inefficiency of current virtualization options. Another user mentions using tools like App Tamer to manage resource-hungry system processes, though this is seen as a workaround rather than a true solution.

Finally, the community explores potential solutions and alternatives. The Asahi Linux project is mentioned as a way to run Linux on Apple Silicon, but it comes with trade-offs like losing Thunderbolt support and having a less mature development status. The historical Mac OS X Server is brought up as a past attempt by Apple to provide a server-focused OS, which was ultimately discontinued due to lack of market demand. The discussion concludes with a strong critique of "optimization" articles, arguing that they often promote harmful practices based on a misunderstanding of modern OS resource management (e.g., the fear of 100% CPU usage or misinterpreting memory statistics).

## [JPEG XL Test Page](https://tildeweb.nl/~michiel/jxl/)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46708032

> **Article:** The article is a test page for the JPEG XL image format, hosted on a personal website. It serves as a practical demonstration to check whether a user's web browser supports rendering JPEG XL images natively, which is a point of ongoing contention in web standards and browser development.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers almost entirely on browser compatibility for JPEG XL, revealing a fragmented landscape. The core debate is between users of Chromium-based browsers (like Chrome and Brave) and those using Firefox or WebKit-based browsers. Many users report that the image fails to load in the latest versions of Chrome and Chromium, noting that the necessary experimental flag is missing from their builds. Conversely, several users confirm that the image displays correctly in Firefox (and its forks like Zen and Waterfox) and in WebKit-based browsers like Epiphany (Gnome Web) and Orion.

There is significant confusion regarding Brave browser, with some users stating it works while others on macOS and Android report it does not, suggesting the outcome may depend on the specific version or platform. The discussion also branches into related topics: the lack of up-to-date WebKit browsers for Android, the potential naming misstep of "JPEG XL" (which some feel doesn't convey lightness), and a nostalgic mention of the classic "Lenna" test image. A user also expresses hope that professional photo processing software will adopt the format in the future.
