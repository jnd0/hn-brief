# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-22

## [EU–INC – A new pan-European legal entity](https://www.eu-inc.org/)
**Score:** 695 | **Comments:** 648 | **ID:** 46703763

> **Article:** The article links to a proposal for "EU-Inc," a new pan-European legal entity championed by EU leadership. The goal is to create a single, simple set of rules for businesses to operate seamlessly across all member states. Key features include the ability to register a company online in any member state within 48 hours, a harmonized capital regime with no minimum capital requirement (unlike the existing European Company - SE structure), and a streamlined digital ecosystem for management and compliance. The initiative is framed as part of a broader strategy to create a more integrated European economy, alongside a deep capital markets union and an affordable energy union, to help EU companies scale and compete globally.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of optimism, skepticism, and regional nuance regarding the EU-Inc proposal. The overall sentiment is cautiously positive, but commenters raise several key points.

A central theme is the perceived difficulty of business administration in Europe, though opinions on this vary. A German developer describes setting up and operating a small company in Germany as a "nightmare," expressing hope that EU-Inc will bring much-needed agility. Other commenters counter this, noting that company formation is already quite simple in countries like Sweden, Spain, and the UK, suggesting the problem may be more acute in certain member states. The discussion highlights that the real challenge isn't just incorporation, but the ongoing regulatory burden and the difficulty of operating across borders, such as hiring in different countries or moving a company's legal domicile.

There is significant interest in the technical details, with users comparing EU-Inc to existing structures like the European Company (SE). The proposal's FAQ is cited to address this, emphasizing that EU-Inc's key advantages are its lack of a minimum capital requirement (€120,000 for an SE), simplified governance, and a dedicated digital platform.

However, skepticism exists around the implementation. One commenter points out that the proposal is likely to be a "directive" rather than a "regulation." This is a crucial distinction, as a directive would require each of the 27 member states to implement it nationally, potentially leading to fragmented interpretations and continued complexity, similar to GDPR. This is seen by some as a "silly" approach that could undermine the goal of uniformity.

The discussion also touches on the broader political context mentioned in the source speech. The proposal for an integrated EU energy market is met with concern from a Swedish commenter, who calls past unification efforts "catastrophic" for prices and the environment. Another comment notes that the recently signed EU-Mercosur trade deal is facing legal challenges and may be frozen, highlighting the difficulties in achieving large-scale European integration. Overall, while the idea of a unified corporate structure is welcomed, the conversation underscores the practical and political hurdles to its successful implementation.

## [Anthropic's original take home assignment open sourced](https://github.com/anthropics/original_performance_takehome)
**Score:** 596 | **Comments:** 324 | **ID:** 46700594

> **Article:** The post links to a GitHub repository containing Anthropic's original performance-focused take-home assignment for engineering candidates. The assignment tasks candidates with optimizing a simulated kernel builder in Python to minimize execution cycles, measured by a provided profiler. The README includes a challenge to beat the performance of Anthropic's own AI model, Claude Opus 4.5, which achieved 1487 cycles, and invites successful candidates to contact their recruiting team.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of technical curiosity and strong opinions about the nature of the assignment. Initial comments clarify the task's objective: to optimize a kernel in a simulated environment using hardware and compiler optimization techniques. The difficulty is noted, with one user describing it as a test of "polyhedral layout algebra" similar to NVIDIA's CuTe or C++'s `std::mdspan`.

Opinions on the assignment's merit are sharply divided. Some praised it as a refreshing, hardcore technical challenge that selects for deep systems knowledge, contrasting it favorably with typical "Next.js web app" projects. However, others criticized it as a "one-sided waste of time" that tests niche knowledge rather than broader creativity, with one user calling the recruiting team's tone "pompous."

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the challenge to beat Claude Opus 4.5. Some interpreted the "at launch" qualifier with suspicion, speculating that Anthropic might intentionally degrade model performance post-launch to save costs. Others used the prompt to test competing AI models, with one user reporting that Google's Gemini CLI got stuck in a long-running loop when asked to solve the challenge.

## [cURL removes bug bounties](https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html)
**Score:** 407 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 46701733

> **Article:** The article reports that the cURL project has discontinued its bug bounty program on HackerOne. The primary reason cited is the overwhelming volume of low-quality, automated, and AI-generated submissions, referred to as "slop." These reports are often nonsensical, false positives, or demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of the software, wasting the time of volunteer maintainers who must triage them. The decision was made to protect the project's limited resources and ensure that developer time is spent on genuine issues rather than sifting through spam.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters expressing both frustration and sympathy for the cURL team's position. The central theme is the negative impact of AI on open-source security processes. Many users shared links to examples of the "slop" reports, describing them as bafflingly incompetent and clearly AI-generated. There was a consensus that the problem is not just the existence of AI, but bad-faith actors using it to spam bug bounty programs in the hope of a payout, with no regard for the project's health.

Several solutions were proposed, though often with caveats. The most prominent idea was implementing an entry fee for submissions, which would be refunded if the report was deemed valid. This was compared to creating "friction" to deter low-effort spam, similar to how slow software like Confluence discourages creating unnecessary pages. However, others countered that determining what constitutes a "reasonable" vulnerability can be tricky. A more cynical suggestion was to use AI to filter out AI-generated spam, but this was met with skepticism about its effectiveness.

The conversation also broadened to the wider implications for open source. One commenter argued that open-source projects are disproportionately harmed by AI, as they are trained on open-source code and then used to spam those same projects, potentially undermining their sustainability. Another pointed out that the issue is a "human problem, not a tool one," highlighting that the motivation is often financial gain rather than a genuine interest in security. The discussion concluded with the observation that removing bounties might not even stop the spam, as submitters may not be aware of the change or are motivated by other factors like building a public portfolio of "security research."

## [Tell HN: Bending Spoons laid off almost everybody at Vimeo yesterday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707699)
**Score:** 345 | **Comments:** 320 | **ID:** 46707699

> **Post:** A user on Hacker News reported that Bending Spoons, an Italian tech company, has laid off almost all employees at Vimeo following its acquisition. The post serves as a heads-up to the community about the event.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focused on Bending Spoons' aggressive business model, the implications for Vimeo's future, and user reactions. Commenters quickly linked to the recent acquisition news and noted the layoffs occurred just two months after the deal closed.

Many users compared the situation to Bending Spoons' previous acquisitions, specifically Evernote and WeTransfer. A frequently cited comment described the company's strategy as "next generation private equity," involving rewriting acquired code with a minimal team, firing most staff, and drastically cutting costs. This pattern has historically resulted in increased prices, restricted free tiers, and a shift away from community-focused development.

Several users expressed concern for specific Vimeo-dependent services, such as the streaming platform Dropout and the classic comedy series MST3K, fearing that the layoffs would negatively impact hosting stability and terms. Others discussed the financial impact, noting that Vimeo's pricing has risen significantly over the years, prompting long-time subscribers to cancel their accounts.

Technical concerns were also raised regarding the open-source project Psalm, a static analyzer for PHP maintained by Vimeo, though the project's creator confirmed it is currently in good hands and independent of the company. Ultimately, the consensus among commenters was skepticism regarding the sustainability of Bending Spoons' model, with many predicting that aggressive monetization and feature cuts would eventually drive users away.

## [Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/)
**Score:** 324 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46709727

> **Article:** The article links to the Linux From Scratch (LFS) project website, which provides a comprehensive book and set of instructions for building a custom Linux system entirely from source code. The process involves compiling the kernel, toolchain (GCC, Binutils), core libraries (Glibc), and essential user-space utilities manually, offering a deep, low-level understanding of how a Linux distribution is constructed.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community regards Linux From Scratch (LFS) as a foundational educational experience rather than a practical daily driver. The consensus is that LFS is invaluable for demystifying the "magic" of operating systems, teaching users about compilation, dependencies, and the inner workings of Linux components like GCC and the boot process.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Educational Value:** Many commenters, particularly those who completed LFS in their youth, credit it with sparking their interest in computer science and systems programming. It is described as a rite of passage that provides a permanent, deeper understanding of how software fits together.
*   **Time Commitment vs. Alternatives:** A recurring point is the significant time investment required—often cited as eight hours or more—which has remained constant despite faster hardware due to increasing software complexity (e.g., LLVM, systemd). While some argue it is a worthwhile marathon, others suggest that distributions like Gentoo or Arch Linux offer a similar, albeit less intense, learning experience with less time spent.
*   **Modern Relevance:** Users note that LFS has evolved to include modern components like systemd and Wayland, though the core process remains challenging. The discussion touches on the increased complexity of modern dependencies (CMake, Meson) compared to older systems.
*   **Practicality:** Most participants agree that few people maintain an LFS system long-term; the primary goal is the learning exercise itself. The difficulty of maintaining a bespoke distribution is highlighted as a major hurdle compared to the initial creation.

## [How AI destroys institutions](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-ai-destroys-institutions/)
**Score:** 286 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 46705606

> **Article:** The article, "How AI Destroys Institutions," argues that Artificial Intelligence poses an existential threat to established societal institutions like higher education, medicine, and law. The author posits that these institutions function by creating stable, predictable patterns and shared knowledge, which AI disrupts by offering hyper-personalized, chaotic, and unaccountable information. The paper contends that while purpose-driven institutions empower individuals to take intellectual risks and challenge the status quo, AI's frictionless access to information undermines the very structures that foster critical thinking and collective trust, potentially leading to their decay.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and critical of the article, with many commenters questioning its validity and thesis. A central point of contention is the paper's academic rigor; one commenter specifically noted that it is a non-peer-reviewed draft and criticized its use of weak evidence, such as citing a news article based on anonymous sources to critique the FDA's use of AI. This led to a broader debate about whether the piece is a substantive academic work or merely an "opinion piece" with a Stanford affiliation.

Many users challenged the core argument, suggesting that AI is not the primary cause of institutional decay. Some argued that institutions were already "fatally wounded" by social media and other modern phenomena, while others contended that AI is a symptom of pre-existing institutional failures—such as low trust in journalism, medicine, and education, and high costs of access—rather than the cause. The title itself was a frequent target, with one user noting the "How" is often dropped in HN submissions and another finding it overly simplistic.

A minority of commenters engaged with the broader philosophical implications, with one dismissing social science as less rigorous than "hard science" and another framing the critique as an inevitable byproduct of technological revolution. Overall, the sentiment leaned heavily toward skepticism, with many users finding the article's argument unconvincing and poorly supported.

## [Claude's new constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution)
**Score:** 258 | **Comments:** 229 | **ID:** 46707572

> **Article:** Anthropic announced a new "constitution" for its AI model, Claude, which serves as a formal set of guidelines and principles that shape the model's behavior. The constitution is intended to provide transparency into the model's values and is used during the training process to generate synthetic data, helping Claude learn to align with these principles. The document emphasizes balancing safety with helpfulness and includes philosophical considerations about Claude's potential status as a "moral patient," reflecting the company's efforts on model welfare.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a highly skeptical and divided community, with several distinct themes emerging. Many commenters are cynical about the constitution's purpose, viewing it as a PR stunt, legal protection ("CYA"), or a simple rebranding of a system prompt. A significant point of contention is the anthropomorphic language used in the constitution, with several users expressing concern that Anthropic is treating the AI as a person or "moral patient," which some found off-putting enough to reconsider working for the company.

On the other hand, some users defended the initiative as a reasonable and necessary step for formalizing AI safety guidelines, noting that other companies likely have similar, albeit private, processes. A key technical point clarified in the comments is that the constitution is used during the model's training phase, not just at inference time, making it more integral than a standard system prompt. The discussion also touched upon the practical trade-offs between safety and helpfulness, with one user noting that Claude itself had described internalizing a "progressively biased" definition of harm. Finally, the conversation connected this announcement to a previously leaked "soul document" from Anthropic, which an employee had confirmed as legitimate.

## [SETI@home is in hiberation](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/)
**Score:** 248 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46703301

> **Article:** The article links to the SETI@home website, which announces that the project has entered hibernation. This means the project is no longer distributing new work units or accepting new results from volunteers. The decision was made because the project has processed all the radio telescope data it had collected over its 21-year lifespan. The project team is now focused on analyzing the accumulated data to search for potential extraterrestrial signals, with the final analysis and results recently published in a scientific paper.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a nostalgic and reflective look back at the SETI@home project, which many commenters remember fondly from their childhoods. A central theme is the emotional and psychological impact of participating; users recall the excitement of running the screensaver on old hardware (like Pentium II and Pentium 4 computers) and the feeling of contributing to a grand scientific search for alien life, even if no signals were ever found. This nostalgia is often tied to the pop-culture context of the late 90s and early 2000s, particularly *The X-Files*, which created a cultural atmosphere where the search for extraterrestrial life felt tangible and exciting.

While some commenters express a sense of disappointment or question if the effort was "for nothing," others clarify that the project was a scientific success, having recently published papers analyzing the full dataset. The conversation also pivots to other distributed computing projects that are still active, such as Folding@home and climateprediction.net, with users discussing their relevance and how to contribute using modern hardware like Raspberry Pis. The overall tone is one of fond remembrance for a pioneering project that inspired a generation to engage with science from their own homes.

## [Scientists find a way to regrow cartilage in mice and human tissue samples](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46709179

> **Article:** A study led by Stanford Medicine researchers has discovered that blocking a protein linked to aging can reverse the natural loss of knee cartilage in older mice. The research, published in *Science*, focuses on inhibiting the enzyme 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) using a small molecule inhibitor. This approach successfully regenerated cartilage in both mouse models and human tissue samples. The findings are promising for treating osteoarthritis, and researchers hope to fast-track the inhibitor to human clinical trials, noting that Phase 1 trials for a related application (muscle weakness) have already shown the drug to be safe in humans.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of cautious optimism, personal anecdotes, and common skepticism regarding medical research. A dominant theme is the perennial frustration with promising treatments that work in mice but have uncertain or long timelines for human application. Users humorously noted that breakthroughs in areas like cartilage regrowth, fusion power, and battery tech are often described as imminent but rarely materialize quickly, with one user creating a satirical function to generate such headlines.

Despite this skepticism, several commenters highlighted the study's promising aspects, particularly that the drug has already passed Phase 1 safety trials for a different condition (muscle weakness), which could accelerate its path to testing for cartilage regeneration. The discussion also touched on the biological mechanism, with one user clarifying that controlled regrowth is distinct from cancer, which involves uncontrolled cell proliferation.

The conversation became deeply personal, with multiple users sharing their own experiences with joint pain, surgeries, and chronic conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. One commenter expressed a poignant desire to run again, which led to a supportive sub-thread about alternative activities like swimming and meditation to achieve a similar state of mental flow. Overall, the community balanced scientific curiosity with the realistic challenges of translating mouse studies into affordable, accessible human therapies.

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository titled "HackerNewsRemovals," which provides a real-time, automated log of stories that have been removed from the Hacker News front page. The project tracks these removals, offering a transparent look at content that the community or moderation system has flagged or downvoted before it could gain significant visibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a community grappling with the nature and effectiveness of HN's moderation, particularly concerning political content and topic fatigue.

A central theme is the tension between HN's technical focus and the increasing intersection of technology with politics. Several users express frustration that important tech-related political debates (e.g., involving Elon Musk, government agencies) are being "silenced by mass flagging." One user argues that in the modern world, "everything is political" and that ignoring this is dangerous. However, a significant contingent of users expresses fatigue with political content, stating a desire for the site to remain focused on "interesting" technology and to avoid becoming another "political echo chamber." They support the "silent majority" that flags such posts to maintain the site's apolitical character.

Another major point of discussion is the topic saturation of AI/LLMs. Users note that they are tired of the constant stream of AI-related news, even if they use the tools themselves, comparing it to past tech-naming trends like "e-" or "i-".

There is also a debate about the mechanics of moderation. Some users feel that the automated flagging system is flawed and can be used by "power users" to censor topics they dislike, suggesting a lack of transparency. In contrast, others defend the flagging system as essential for keeping the site free of ads and low-quality content. The conversation concludes with a mix of appreciation for the human moderation team's efforts and calls for improvements to the flagging system to provide more visibility and fairness.

**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46700503

> **Article:** The article introduces RSS.Social, a new web service designed to aggregate and display the latest content from small, independent websites. The platform aims to help users discover new blogs and personal sites through a curated RSS feed-style interface, positioning itself as a destination for exploring the "small web."
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's response to RSS.Social was generally positive but focused heavily on feature requests and comparisons to existing tools. Users appreciated the concept of discovering small web content but offered specific suggestions for improvement. The most common feedback was the need for content summaries or previews; several commenters noted that titles alone are often insufficient for discovery, and clicking on uninteresting links creates friction. Technical issues were also raised, with one user reporting being blocked by Cloudflare and another requesting better validation for included feeds.

A significant portion of the discussion shifted to alternatives, particularly Kagi's Small Web feed. Users shared tips on filtering Kagi's feed to reduce noise, mentioning specific URLs for "appreciated" articles and specialized feeds for videos, code, and comics. This sparked a sub-thread about the challenges of managing high-volume feeds.

The conversation also touched on the subjectivity of the term "best" in the site's tagline, with users suggesting the creators clarify their curation criteria. Several other similar projects were promoted in the comments, including IndieBlog.page for random blog discovery, Hcker.news for filtering Kagi's Small Web on Hacker News, and Minifeed.net, another directory of personal blogs.

## [Ireland wants to give its cops spyware, ability to crack encrypted messages](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/ireland_wants_to_give_police/)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46705715

> **Article:** The Register reports that the Irish government is seeking to grant its police force, the Gardaí, new powers to use spyware and crack encrypted messages. The proposed legislation aims to update surveillance laws to keep pace with modern technology, specifically targeting end-to-end encrypted communications on platforms like WhatsApp and Signal. The article highlights the ongoing tension between law enforcement's need for access to data for criminal investigations and the privacy rights of citizens, framing it within the broader international debate on encryption and state surveillance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the Irish government's proposal, with commenters expressing fatigue and cynicism towards what they perceive as a recurring global trend of increasing state surveillance. The conversation quickly broadens from the specific Irish context to a wider critique of government overreach and the ineffectiveness of law enforcement.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **The Futility of Banning Encryption:** A central technical argument is that mandating backdoors is fundamentally misguided. Commenters noted that such laws would compel service providers to insert vulnerabilities, ultimately negating cryptographic security for everyone. Others argued that determined criminals would simply use open-source, non-compliant tools, making the legislation ineffective against its intended targets while harming ordinary citizens' privacy.

*   **Cynicism Towards Law Enforcement Motives:** Many users questioned the police's stated goal of preventing crime. This was supported by examples of official inaction, such as a Romanian case where police failed to act on a kidnapped girl's repeated emergency calls, and a US legal precedent establishing that police have no specific obligation to protect individuals. This led to a cynical view that police are more motivated by financial incentives (e.g., asset forfeiture) than by public safety.

*   **A Broader Pattern of State Control:** The discussion framed the Irish proposal as part of a coordinated, international effort by governments to erode digital privacy. Commenters suggested this trend is driven by a fear of decentralized technology threatening centralized power, with Western governments allegedly receiving similar intelligence briefings. The move was also compared to the UK's surveillance policies, reinforcing the idea that it's not an isolated issue.

*   **The Ineffectiveness of the Legislation:** One commenter pointed out the irony of focusing on a high-tech cyberpolice force when the Gardaí are already understaffed and struggle with basic policing duties. This highlights a perceived disconnect between the government's priorities and the on-the-ground reality of public safety needs.

## [The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns](https://www.nibzard.com/agentic-handbook)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 134 | **ID:** 46701969

> **Article:** The article, "The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns," is a comprehensive guide to building and deploying AI agents. It consolidates various techniques and patterns for agentic coding, aiming to standardize the vocabulary in the emerging field of AI-assisted programming. The handbook covers strategies for agent coordination, tool use, and managing agent workflows, presenting them as production-ready solutions for developers. The author also provides a companion website and a GitHub repository for the material.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant divide between optimism and skepticism regarding the current state and practicality of AI agents in software development.

A central theme is the high cognitive overhead and unreliability of agents. Several commenters express frustration with the effort required to manage agents, arguing that the process of preventing them from "going off the rails" is often more work than performing the task manually. This sentiment is captured in the critique of the "pipe dream" of automated issue-to-PR workflows, which many see as a "nightmare" of fixing downstream regressions and chaos. The practicality of the handbook is questioned, with some suggesting the patterns are more suited for "middle managers" to present in an "AI Strategy" meeting than for developers to use.

Conversely, other users defend the value of such resources. They argue that while the field is nascent and has "pain at the start," documenting and standardizing patterns is a crucial step in learning to effectively harness the technology. This camp sees the handbook as a valuable tool for articulating solutions and evolving best practices, similar to how developers adopted patterns like TDD.

A secondary, more cynical thread dismisses the handbook as "snake oil" and "slop," comparing the emerging "Agentic" trend to the hype cycles of "Design Patterns" and "Agile/Scrum." This view is amplified by the observation that the article itself may have been AI-generated, leading to a meta-discussion about the prevalence of such content. Some commenters advocate for a more fundamental approach, suggesting developers should read academic papers or develop their own patterns from scratch rather than relying on curated, potentially low-quality summaries. The overall sentiment is that while AI tools like Claude Code are useful, the industry is currently over-complicating their application with excessive frameworks and terminology.

## [Waiting for dawn in search: Search index, Google rulings and impact on Kagi](https://blog.kagi.com/waiting-dawn-search)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46708678

> **Article:** The Kagi blog post "Waiting for dawn in search" outlines the immense challenges of building a modern search engine independent of Google. The author argues that the search index is a critical piece of infrastructure, akin to a "national railroad," that is effectively closed off to competitors. Google does not offer a public API for its core search results, and direct licensing is prohibitively expensive or unavailable for most companies. As a result, alternative search providers like Kagi are forced to rely on third-party "SERP API" providers that scrape Google's results, creating a fragile and indirect dependency. The post frames this as a market failure, suggesting that meaningful competition is impossible without regulatory intervention to force Google to open its index, and expresses hope that ongoing antitrust rulings against Google will change this dynamic.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around Kagi's reliance on third-party providers to access Google's search index, a fact revealed in the article. Commenters express a mix of surprise, cynicism, and concern over this admission. A key point of contention is the privacy implication: even though Kagi is a paid, ad-free service, user queries are ultimately sent to Google, subjecting them to its data collection policies.

Several themes emerge from the comments:

*   **Ethics and Legality of Scraping:** One commenter finds it "crazy" that Kagi admits to reselling scraped Google results, while others defend it as a standard, if ethically gray, business practice. The debate touches on whether this is "stealing" or a necessary workaround in a monopolistic market.
*   **Transparency and Kagi's "Small-Web Index":** Skepticism is raised about Kagi's claim of having its "own small-web index." Commenters question what this actually entails, with some speculating it might be minimal or misleading, while others suggest it refers to licensed data from projects like Marginalia Search.
*   **The Nature of Monopoly and Competition:** The discussion broadens to the fundamental issue of Google's market dominance. While one commenter suggests Google's 90% market share is simply due to being the best product, others counter that a true monopoly prevents better alternatives from emerging, regardless of quality. The difficulty of building a competing index from scratch is compared to building a national railroad, highlighting the immense infrastructure costs.
*   **Global Search Statistics:** A sub-thread critiques the article's use of statistics claiming Google has 90% global market share. Commenters point out that this is likely skewed by excluding large populations in countries like China where Google is blocked, making the "worldwide" claim questionable.
*   **User Behavior and Alternatives:** Some users discuss the shift towards AI-powered search tools that provide direct answers, reducing the need to visit various websites. Others mention alternative search projects like Ecosia, Qwant, and Common Crawl as potential building blocks for a more open search ecosystem.

> **Article:** The article analyzes data from Hacker News to show that while the percentage of "Show HN" posts has increased over time, their average score has decreased. The author suggests this indicates a decline in the perceived quality or engagement of these projects, potentially due to the ease of creating AI-generated content that floods the queue without resonating with the community.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's findings with anecdotal evidence, attributing the decline in quality and engagement to the proliferation of AI-generated projects. Commenters describe the "Show HN" section as being flooded with "slop," particularly low-effort AI tools and "agentic" projects, which has led to user fatigue and a lack of interaction for non-AI submissions.

A secondary theme focuses on the mechanics of Hacker News itself. Users argue that the "Show HN" section receives significantly less traffic than the main "New" queue, making it a poor venue for launching products. There is a perceived inconsistency in how posts are promoted to the front page, with some feeling that the system is opaque or ineffective.

Finally, the conversation touches on broader implications for the software industry. Some commenters worry that the low barrier to entry for creating AI software will flood the market, making it harder for high-quality projects to gain attention and potentially devaluing development work. However, others defend the use of AI, arguing that it enables developers to build interesting projects they otherwise wouldn't have time for. Moderators and community members express a desire to refocus "Show HN" on substantive, educational projects rather than product launches, though they acknowledge the difficulty in curating the influx.

## [Swedish Alecta has sold off an estimated $8B of US Treasury Bonds](https://www.di.se/nyheter/di-avslojar-alecta-har-dumpat-amerikanska-statspapper/)

> **Article:** The article reports that Swedish pension fund Alecta has sold off an estimated $8 billion in US Treasury bonds. The original source is a Swedish financial news outlet, di.se. The post links this event to a series of similar recent actions by other European pension funds, particularly from Denmark, suggesting a potential trend of European institutional investors divesting from US government debt.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the significance and potential implications of Alecta's sale, with opinions split between viewing it as a minor financial event and a symbolic indicator of a larger geopolitical trend.

Many commenters downplayed the immediate financial impact, noting that $8 billion is a tiny fraction (roughly 1/4000th) of the total US Treasury market. They argued that for every seller, there is a buyer, and the market is liquid enough to absorb such a sale without significant price disruption. Some attributed recent volatility in bond yields to larger factors, like Japan's monetary policy, rather than this specific sale.

However, a significant counter-argument emphasized the symbolic importance and the potential for a larger trend. Commenters pointed out that this is not an isolated event, citing other European funds' recent divestments. They argued that while a single sale is a "drop," a coordinated or sustained reduction in demand from major foreign holders could eventually lead to higher US interest rates, increased inflation, and a weaker dollar. This was framed as part of a broader "de-dollarization" narrative.

The discussion also explored the practical challenges of divestment, specifically the question of viable alternatives. A key point was the lack of a deep, unified European bond market to rival the US Treasury market. The EU's fragmented fiscal policy and absence of bloc-wide debt were identified as major hurdles preventing the Euro from easily supplanting the dollar as the world's primary reserve asset. While some suggested alternatives like gold, other equities, or Chinese assets, others noted the difficulty of finding a market large enough to absorb such capital flows without distorting prices.

Ultimately, the conversation concluded that while the direct market effect of this single sale is negligible, it fuels a debate about the long-term stability of US debt markets and the geopolitical shifts influencing global investment strategies.

## [Nested code fences in Markdown](https://susam.net/nested-code-fences.html)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46705201

> **Article:** The article explains how to nest code fences in Markdown. It clarifies that Markdown's specification allows for code fences of any length (at least three backticks or tildes), not just three. To nest a code block, you simply use a fence with more backticks (or tildes) than the inner block. For example, to display a fenced code block inside another, you wrap the inner block with four backticks if the inner block uses three. This ensures the parser correctly identifies the outer block's boundaries.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focuses on the inherent flaws and complexities of Markdown's design, particularly regarding code fences. Many commenters express frustration with the ambiguity of the specification, noting that Markdown's lack of a formal standard led to a proliferation of inconsistent implementations. The core criticism is that using the same symbol (backticks or tildes) for both opening and closing delimiters, requiring users to count characters to match them, is a poor design choice. Alternatives are proposed, such as distinct start and end markers (e.g., `[[[` and `]]]`) or length-prefixing, which would simplify parsing and avoid the need for escaping content.

There is also a practical discussion on workarounds. Users share that they often resort to HTML tags (`<pre>`, `<code>`) or use delimiters with significantly more characters than appear in the content (e.g., `~~~~` to wrap a block containing ` ``` `). The conversation touches on related systems like GitHub's suggestion syntax and JupyterBook, which use this nesting technique effectively. Finally, some commenters point to more robust alternatives like CommonMark (which provides a formal spec) and Org-mode (which uses distinct `#+BEGIN_SRC` and `#+END_SRC` tags).

## [SmartOS](https://docs.smartos.org/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46706947

> **Article:** The article links to the official documentation for SmartOS, a specialized, open-source operating system. SmartOS is a "live OS" that boots from external media (like a USB key or PXE) and runs entirely from memory. This design allows local disks to be dedicated exclusively to hosting virtual machines and containers, with the OS itself leaving no persistent footprint on the hardware. It is based on the Illumos kernel (a derivative of OpenSolaris) and is designed for hyper-converged datacenter infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals that while SmartOS was once a prominent topic on Hacker News, its visibility has significantly diminished. Commenters attribute this to the acquisition of its parent company, Joyent, by Samsung, and a perception that the project's leadership was elitist and not community-focused. Despite this, some users still run SmartOS for personal projects, praising its tooling, though they note it's too niche for professional customer engagements.

A key technical point of interest is SmartOS's "live OS" architecture, which allows for a centralized, immutable OS image for a cluster. This sparked a sub-discussion about achieving similar functionality with more common platforms like Proxmox, with some users suggesting PXE booting while others see it as an unnecessary complication compared to simpler methods like read-only disk images.

The conversation also touched on related technologies and concepts:
*   **Manta Object Storage:** A feature of the Triton platform (which uses SmartOS) that allows for compute jobs to be scheduled on storage nodes to improve data locality. Practical experiences were mixed; some found it conceptually powerful but arcane to use, and it didn't always provide significant performance gains over traditional methods.
*   **Illumos Lineage:** Users clarified the OS's heritage: Solaris -> OpenSolaris -> Illumos (the open-source fork) -> SmartOS (a specialized distro of Illumos).
*   **Modern Relevance:** A central question was what SmartOS offers in 2026 compared to Linux or FreeBSD. Proponents highlighted its advanced features like the Service Management Facility (SMF), the powerful MDB debugger, and mature Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The Oxide Computer company's use of a custom Illumos-based OS (Helios) was cited as a modern example of these advantages.
*   **Alternatives:** Some mentioned other projects like IncusOS as potential successors, though others argued that a combination of a mainstream OS like NixOS with modern tools like Incus might be a more practical approach today.
