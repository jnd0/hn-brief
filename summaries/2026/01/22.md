# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-22

## [We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports](https://curl.se/.well-known/security.txt)
**Score:** 863 | **Comments:** 563 | **ID:** 46717556

> **Article:** The linked article is a security.txt file from curl.se, which is a standard file for security researchers to find contact information for reporting vulnerabilities. The file contains a new, strongly-worded policy statement directed at individuals who submit low-quality or AI-generated "slop" reports. The policy states that such submitters will be publicly ridiculed and banned from further contact, explicitly stating that the project will not waste time on such reports. This is a direct response to a recent decision by the curl project to eliminate its bug bounty program, which was seen as a financial incentive for generating large volumes of low-quality, AI-generated reports.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the growing problem of AI-generated "slop" overwhelming open-source maintainers, with the curl project's new policy as a case study. A key theme is the debate over the effectiveness of public shaming. While some commenters feel it's a fair and necessary deterrent, others argue that the operators of these AI scripts are often insulated from criticism and will simply feed the response back to the LLM, rendering rudeness ineffective and potentially discouraging legitimate, human contributors.

Commenters widely agree that the issue predates modern LLMs, citing past problems like Hacktoberfest and students submitting unverified reports for academic credit. The discussion explores alternative solutions, such as moving to niche platforms to raise the barrier to entry or requiring discussions before issues can be filed. There is a shared sense of frustration and sympathy for maintainers, who face a thankless task of sifting through a deluge of automated noise, a problem that scales poorly as the cost of generating reports approaches zero. The conversation also touches on the broader societal bleed of AI-generated content from academia into all professional fields.

## [Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/)
**Score:** 606 | **Comments:** 436 | **ID:** 46712678

> **Article:** The article, "Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant," presents research findings from a four-month study on the cognitive effects of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for essay writing. The study compared three groups: one using only their own brains, one using a search engine, and one using an LLM. The results indicate that LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. The research suggests that reliance on AI assistants for writing tasks leads to a "cognitive debt," where cognitive activity is scaled down in relation to external tool use. A key concern raised is that even after LLM users switched back to unaided writing, they still showed reduced cognitive engagement, indicating a persistent negative impact on learning and critical thinking skills.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion围绕 the study's findings and the broader implications of AI on cognitive skills and the tech industry. A central theme is the concern over long-term cognitive degradation, with users expressing that relying on AI for answers without learning the process is detrimental, especially for children. This anxiety extends to the software development industry, where one commenter predicts a "massive talent crunch" in a few years. They argue that the combination of AI automation of junior-level tasks, a lack of new "pre-AI" developers, and industry layoffs will cripple the talent pipeline, ultimately increasing the value of experienced engineers who can work without AI assistance.

However, the discussion also includes significant skepticism about the study's validity. One commenter dismisses it as a "non-study," arguing the conclusion is obvious (people who don't do the work don't learn). Another criticizes the methodology, comparing it to a flawed study on smartphone users where participants likely performed better on a second test simply because they were more invested. A more nuanced perspective on AI's role in work emerged, with a commenter distinguishing between "vibing" (hands-off delegation) and active collaboration with an AI. They suggest that while passive use is detrimental, actively working with an AI to solve problems can remain an engaging process. This sentiment was echoed by another user who finds LLMs useful for code comprehension and learning, but warns against letting the AI do all the reasoning, which is what leads to cognitive debt.

## [GPTZero finds 100 new hallucinations in NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers](https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/)
**Score:** 588 | **Comments:** 298 | **ID:** 46720395

> **Article:** The article from GPTZero reports that its AI detection tool identified 100 instances of AI-generated "hallucinations" (fabricated data, references, or text) within papers accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 conference. The findings highlight a growing concern that generative AI is being used to produce plausible-sounding but factually incorrect scientific content that is passing through the peer-review process undetected. The article implies that the integrity of academic publishing is at risk as AI tools become capable of generating content that mimics legitimate research without containing verifiable facts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses significant alarm and cynicism regarding the findings, viewing the issue as a symptom of broader systemic problems in academic research. The consensus is that the use of LLMs to generate fake data or references constitutes scientific fraud and will severely harm the credibility of scientific research.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Systemic Failure of Peer Review:** Commenters argue that the fact these hallucinations passed review indicates a breakdown in the vetting process. Many noted that reviewers are overworked and under-resourced, often relying on trust rather than verifying every reference. Some speculated that the reviewers themselves might be using AI tools, further diluting the quality of scrutiny.
*   **Pre-existing Issues in Science:** Several users pointed out that "AI slop" is merely exacerbating existing problems like p-hacking, data falsification, and the "publish or perish" culture that prioritizes optics over substance. There was a sentiment that the academic environment was already prone to "fake it 'til you make it" mentalities before LLMs became prevalent.
*   **Skepticism of AI Detectors:** A recurring counterpoint was skepticism toward GPTZero itself. Users questioned the methodology, suggesting that without a baseline comparison (error rates in pre-2020 papers), it is impossible to know if AI is the primary cause of these hallucinations or if human error has always been present at similar rates.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** Suggestions for remediation included mandating reproducible code (the "PoC or GTFO" approach) and implementing stricter automated screening for references before human review. However, others noted that the sheer volume of submissions to conferences like NeurIPS makes manual verification practically impossible.
*   **Consequences:** There was a strong call for punitive measures against researchers who use AI to fabricate results, with many commenters asserting that such actions should be treated as career-ending fraud.

## [Show HN: Sweep, Open-weights 1.5B model for next-edit autocomplete](https://huggingface.co/sweepai/sweep-next-edit-1.5B)
**Score:** 503 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46713106

> **Project:** Sweep is an open-weights 1.5B parameter code model designed for "next-edit" autocomplete, which predicts the next change or insertion in a file rather than just completing text at the cursor. It is based on Qwen2.5-Coder and was trained using a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve syntactic correctness and semantic relevance. The model is released on Hugging Face, and the team published a technical blog post detailing their data generation and training process.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with users expressing interest in the technical details and the potential for local, offline code completion. A primary topic of discussion was clarifying the difference between "next-edit" and Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) models; commenters explained that FIM fills gaps between existing code blocks, while next-edit predicts the immediate next edit or change, similar to how tools like Cursor operate.

There was significant demand for editor integrations, particularly for VS Code, Neovim, Sublime Text, and Monaco. Several users mentioned they would attempt to build plugins, with one already sharing a GitHub repository for a Sublime Text implementation. Users also compared Sweep to existing solutions, noting that Sweep's JetBrains plugin is already popular and questioning if the open model could outperform commercial or built-in IDE completions.

Technical questions focused on the training cost and methodology. Users speculated that the low cost of training was due to building upon the Qwen2.5-Coder base model. A deeper discussion ensued regarding the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) versus constrained decoding; one commenter explained that while constrained decoding ensures syntactic validity, RL allows the model to learn semantic correctness and explore complex coding tasks beyond just grammar rules. Finally, there was anticipation for larger model releases (3B or 7B) to improve performance further.

## [In Europe, wind and solar overtake fossil fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels)
**Score:** 434 | **Comments:** 456 | **ID:** 46719491

> **Article:** The article from Yale Environment 360 reports that for the first time, wind and solar power have generated more electricity in Europe than fossil fuels. In 2022, renewables accounted for 34% of the EU's electricity, while fossil fuels dropped to 33%. This milestone is attributed to a decade of steady growth in renewable capacity, accelerated recently by the energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The piece notes that while this is a significant achievement for the power sector, it represents only a portion of Europe's total energy consumption, which still relies heavily on fossil fuels for transportation and heating.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely celebrates the achievement but quickly pivots to a broader, more contentious debate about the costs, context, and future implications of the energy transition.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the geopolitical and economic dimensions. Several users argued that Europe's shift to renewables is a strategic move for energy independence, reducing reliance on hostile nations like Russia. This led to a debate about China's role, with some suggesting China benefits from Russia's isolation and dependence, while others see China as a primary competitor whose cheap, non-green manufacturing undermines European industry. The high cost of European energy compared to the US was a major point of contention. Critics argued that expensive electricity, driven by green policies, is crippling European industry and making it less competitive. Conversely, defenders countered that higher prices are a trade-off for energy security and that Europe's lack of domestic fossil fuels is a key reason for the price disparity, unlike the resource-rich US.

The technical scope of the article's claim was also scrutinized. Commenters pointed out that the data pertains only to electricity generation, not total energy consumption, which is a much larger challenge involving transportation and heating. However, others noted that this is a critical first step, and the increasing adoption of EVs and heat pumps will help electrify these sectors.

Finally, the discussion explored the practical challenges and solutions for a renewable-dominated grid. The intermittency of wind and solar was raised as a key hurdle, particularly for winter heating demand. However, other users offered counterpoints, highlighting the falling costs of battery storage, which are already beginning to displace natural gas during peak evening hours. They also pointed to the potential of heat pumps, thermal storage (like hot water tanks), and the seasonal correlation of wind power as solutions to the intermittency problem. The conversation concluded with a sense of cautious optimism, acknowledging the milestone while recognizing the significant engineering and economic challenges that remain.

## [Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/)
**Score:** 426 | **Comments:** 475 | **ID:** 46713924

> **Article:** The article, authored by a group of computer scientists and security experts, argues that internet voting is inherently insecure and should not be used in public elections. The core reasoning is that any internet-connected voting system faces insurmountable security challenges, including vulnerabilities to hacking, malware on voter devices, denial-of-service attacks, and the fundamental difficulty of ensuring voter privacy and coercion resistance in a remote digital environment. The authors contend that while technology can improve efficiency, the risks to election integrity and public trust are too high. They advocate for the continued use of paper-based ballots, which provide a tangible, auditable record that can be manually verified, as the gold standard for secure elections.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely aligns with the article's conclusion, expressing deep skepticism about internet voting and a strong preference for paper ballots. The consensus is that election security and public trust are far more critical than the efficiency gains offered by digital methods.

Many commenters championed paper-based systems, often citing their own countries' successful implementations. An Australian user detailed their nation's use of pencils, paper, and manual counting with robust oversight, arguing that this method "just works" and inspires confidence. Others referenced the voting systems in India and the UK, praising their seriousness and integrity. This sentiment was echoed by users who suggested that moving away from paper has already damaged trust and that a return to it is necessary.

A key theme was the trade-off between security and convenience. While one user wondered if more efficient (though not necessarily internet-based) systems could improve voter turnout, the prevailing view, articulated by a commenter stating "The most important feature of public elections is trust. Efficiency is one of the least important feature," prioritized integrity above all else. The infamous "hanging chad" incident from the 2000 US election was mentioned, but even with its flaws, users argued that the problems of paper are preferable to the unverifiable and scalable risks of internet voting.

Technical concerns were also prominent. One user highlighted the challenge of creating a secure system for managing cryptographic tokens for voters, while another pointed out the critical distinction between systems that need to be anonymous (voting) and those that need to be reversible and demonstrable (financial transactions). The Estonian internet voting system was specifically called out as an example that, despite being technologically advanced, still suffers from the fundamental security flaws inherent in all remote electronic voting.

Finally, the discussion touched on the social and political dimensions of voting. One user noted that in their region, voting isn't even an option, highlighting that the method is a secondary concern to the fundamental right itself. There was also a brief, cynical exchange about the potential for propaganda bots to manipulate the conversation over time, reflecting a broader anxiety about online discourse.

## [Show HN: isometric.nyc – giant isometric pixel art map of NYC](https://cannoneyed.com/isometric-nyc/)
**Score:** 404 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46721802

> **Project:** The project is an interactive, giant isometric pixel art map of New York City, created by a developer using generative AI (specifically models like GPT-4o and Gemini). The author details a technical process involving generating isometric tiles via AI, refining them with scripts, and stitching them together into a seamless zoomable map. The project is presented as a case study on "unlocking scale"—using AI to accomplish a volume of creative work that would be prohibitively time-consuming for a human. The author argues that while AI makes content generation easy (commoditizing it), it elevates the importance of human vision, curation, and "love" in the creative process.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction was a mix of technical appreciation and philosophical debate regarding the role of AI in art. Visually, the project was widely praised as "beautiful" and "impressive," with several users requesting similar maps for other cities like San Francisco and Tokyo.

The central point of contention was the ethics and value of AI-generated art. One commenter expressed a moral hesitation, arguing that the sheer scale of AI output threatens human expression and artistic opportunities, suggesting that if a project "couldn't exist" without AI, perhaps it "shouldn't exist at all." The creator responded by framing AI as a standard technological evolution, acknowledging both the excitement for new creative domains and the sadness regarding obsolescence of traditional crafts. Other users debated the definition of "art" versus "slop," with some appreciating the author's philosophy that AI commoditizes content, making human intent and curation the differentiator, while others felt the project lacked the "love" of traditional masterworks.

On the technical side, discussions covered the choice of coding tools (Cursor vs. Antigravity), comparisons to other massive manual projects (like a physical NYC miniature or a 1:1 scale Minecraft build), and initial issues with the site being hugged to death or suffering CORS/rate-limiting errors.

## [Qwen3-TTS family is now open sourced: Voice design, clone, and generation](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115)
**Score:** 375 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46719229

> **Article:** Alibaba's Qwen team has open-sourced the Qwen3-TTS family, a suite of text-to-speech models that support voice design, cloning, and generation. The release includes models of varying sizes (0.6B to 1.8B parameters) and capabilities, such as cross-lingual voice cloning, where a voice can speak in a different language. The announcement includes a blog post with extensive audio samples demonstrating the technology's quality and versatility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of technical curiosity, amazement at the quality, and significant ethical concern. The most prominent observation was the distinct sound of the English audio samples, with multiple users noting they sounded like "anime voices" or popular YouTubers, suggesting a potential bias in the training data.

Technically, users discussed the practicalities of running the models locally. While some provided resources like Hugging Face demos and a custom CLI tool to simplify the process, others noted challenges, particularly for non-NVIDIA hardware like Macs, though workarounds were mentioned. The size of the models was also a point of comparison, noted to be significantly larger than alternatives like Pocket TTS.

The quality of the voice cloning was described as "uncanny" and "terrifying," sparking a strong ethical debate. Commenters expressed alarm at the potential for abuse, such as scams and misinformation, with one user stating we are "sleepwalking into this" and should assume all digital media is fake by default. On the other hand, several users highlighted positive and creative applications, such as restoring old, degraded audio recordings (e.g., classic radio plays) and creating personalized content like a deceased relative reading a bedtime story. The discussion also briefly touched on the broader AI landscape, with a user expressing a desire for the Qwen team to surpass leading coding models and making a critical comment about a different AI company's leadership.

## [Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over "heroes"](https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 321 | **ID:** 46719222

> **Article:** The article links to a blog post that quotes author Douglas Adams on the cultural difference between American and British storytelling, specifically regarding "heroes." Adams posits that American heroes are defined by competence, autonomy, and the ability to overcome obstacles to achieve a clear goal. In contrast, British heroes are often defined by their struggle against insurmountable odds, where the act of trying is more important than succeeding, and failure is accepted as a part of life. The article uses examples like *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* (where the hero is a confused everyman) versus the typical Hollywood action hero to illustrate this divide.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates Douglas Adams' observation, with users expanding on the cultural divide through various media. Many commenters, particularly those from the UK, agree that American humor and heroism can be difficult to relate to, while others note that modern American shows like *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* have adopted a more British, cynical tone where characters are "lovable losers" who rarely win.

Several users pointed to specific cultural artifacts to illustrate the divide. A prominent example is the difference between the UK and US versions of *The Office*: the UK version is bleak and focuses on failure, while the US version is optimistic and sunny. Others noted that British-authored YA fiction like *Harry Potter* became massive hits in the US because the protagonists (Harry, Hermione, Ron) embodied the American ideal of autonomy and mastery, despite the setting being British.

There was significant debate regarding the universality of Adams' claim. Some commenters argued that "lovable loser" archetypes do exist in American culture, citing Charlie Brown as a prime example of an optimistic underdog. However, a counterpoint was raised that Americans often view Charlie Brown with contempt rather than sympathy, seeing his failures as a result of personal lack of effort rather than bad luck.

Finally, some users broadened the scope beyond the UK/US binary, noting that Japanese anime and Hayao Miyazaki films often feature morally complex characters that differ from both American and British archetypes. The consensus was that while the distinction is a generalization, it holds true when analyzing mainstream Hollywood productions versus traditional British storytelling.

## [Threat actors expand abuse of Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://www.jamf.com/blog/threat-actors-expand-abuse-of-visual-studio-code/)
**Score:** 272 | **Comments:** 273 | **ID:** 46713526

> **Article:** The article from Jamf details how threat actors are increasingly abusing Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) features to execute malicious code. The primary attack vector involves malicious `tasks.json` files within a project's `.vscode` directory. When a user opens a folder in VS Code and explicitly trusts the project (a prompt shown by the editor), the IDE automatically processes these configuration files. This allows attackers to embed arbitrary commands that run on the user's system under the guise of legitimate build tasks, effectively turning the code editor into a vector for malware execution. The article highlights this as a significant security risk, comparing it to historical threats like macro-enabled Office documents, where convenience and trust are exploited to compromise systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the broader implications of VS Code's security model, the editor's popularity, and the trade-offs of modern development environments. A key theme was the inherent risk of modern IDEs that run on web technologies and automatically execute code, with several users expressing a preference for more traditional, sandboxed environments like JetBrains IDEs or the JVM over Electron-based applications. The conversation frequently returned to the concept of trust; while VS Code prompts users to trust a folder, commenters argued that users are conditioned to click "trust" for convenience, making the security feature insufficient against determined social engineering.

There was also a debate on VS Code's dominance. While one user questioned its prevalence compared to Eclipse (attributing Eclipse's decline to its focus on Java), others defended VS Code as being "good enough," extensible, and the de facto standard for its versatility. The security issue itself was compared to existing vulnerabilities in other tools like Vim or build systems like Maven, where any tool that executes code from a project directory is inherently risky. Finally, the discussion explored potential solutions, with a strong consensus that better application sandboxing and the default use of development containers are necessary to isolate projects and protect host machines from malicious code.

## [Significant US farm losses persist, despite federal assistance](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/significant-farm-losses-persist-despite-federal-assistance)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 381 | **ID:** 46713929

> **Article:** The article from the American Farm Bureau Federation (FB.org) argues that despite federal assistance, significant financial losses persist for US farms. It presents data indicating that farm income remains well below the five-year average, with high input costs (fertilizer, fuel, interest rates) and declining commodity prices squeezing profit margins. The article suggests that current safety net programs, such as crop insurance and ad-hoc disaster aid, are insufficient to offset the structural economic pressures facing producers, warning of a potential liquidity crisis for many family farms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the economic viability of farming, the role of government intervention, and the political dynamics of rural America.

A primary theme was the debate over agricultural subsidies. One side argued that subsidies are economically inefficient, preventing necessary innovation and market optimization, citing New Zealand's deregulation as a success story. The counter-argument emphasized national security and food sovereignty, asserting that food production cannot be treated purely as a profit-driven industry due to the risks of relying on foreign imports. Others noted the political utility of subsidies in maintaining stable, low food prices for consumers, which prevents civil unrest.

Users also identified structural issues within the agricultural supply chain. A recurring point was that farmers are squeezed by monopolistic "middlemen"—specifically large seed corporations (like Bayer/Monsanto), machinery manufacturers (John Deere), and commodity buyers (Cargill). Commenters argued that subsidies often fail to help farmers directly, instead flowing to these large corporations to whom farmers are heavily indebted.

The discussion included a comparison of the US model to Canada's "Supply Management" system, which uses production quotas to stabilize prices and prevent the boom-bust cycles common in US agriculture. While some praised this model for ensuring farmer profitability without bailouts, others criticized it for inefficiency and artificially high consumer prices.

Finally, the conversation touched on the political behavior of farmers. Several commenters noted the irony that farmers overwhelmingly vote for Republican candidates (specifically Trump), despite policies like tariffs that have historically damaged agricultural exports (particularly to China). The consensus was that political identity often overrides economic self-interest in rural voting patterns.

## [Doctors in Brazil using tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims (2017)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/brazilian-city-uses-tilapia-fish-skin-treat-burn-victims)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46715600

> **Article:** A 2017 PBS NewsHour article reports on a Brazilian medical innovation using sterilized tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims. The fish skin is processed to remove scales and odor, then applied directly to burns. It acts as a natural bandage that retains moisture, reduces pain, and speeds up healing compared to traditional treatments. The method is significantly cheaper than synthetic or human skin alternatives, as tilapia skin is often considered waste in the fish farming industry. While the technique is approved for use in Brazil, regulatory hurdles and the availability of donated human skin make its adoption in the United States unlikely in the near future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the regulatory, scientific, and pop-culture aspects of the tilapia skin treatment. Several users immediately recognized the technique from its depiction in popular medical TV shows like *Grey's Anatomy* and *The Good Doctor*, which aired episodes featuring the procedure around the same time as the article's publication.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One commenter frames the high scrutiny for animal-based products as a failure of regulation, echoing Milton Friedman, while another counters that Brazil's own regulatory body is even stricter, suggesting the difference might be due to lobbying or the influence of animal rights groups in the US.

The scientific validity of the treatment was also questioned. A commenter claimed that metastudies debunked the efficacy of fish skin, suggesting it offers no significant advantage over silver sulfadiazine (a common burn ointment) and acts more like a placebo. However, another user countered by citing a study on collagen patches, which are similar to fish skin, showing they can reduce the need for skin grafts and improve patient comfort, even if the final healing time isn't drastically different.

Other points of discussion included:
*   **Practicality and Cost:** Users noted that tilapia is ideal because it is farmed in massive quantities, making the skin cheap and abundant.
*   **Anecdotal Evidence:** One user shared a personal story of a severe burn healing quickly after being prescribed silver cream, reinforcing the value of established treatments.
*   **Humor and Speculation:** The conversation included lighthearted references to Frank Herbert's *Dune* and speculative comments about the treatment's history and potential use in veterinary medicine.

## [Design Thinking Books (2024)](https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-books/)
**Score:** 255 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46718061

> **Article:** The article "Design Thinking Books (2024)" from Designorate.com provides a curated list of recommended books on the topic of design thinking. It categorizes the books into sections such as "Design Thinking Foundations," "Creativity and Innovation," "User Experience and Human-Centered Design," and "Systems Thinking and Strategy." Key titles mentioned include classics like *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman, *Creative Confidence* by Tom and David Kelley, and *The Sciences of the Artificial* by Herbert Simon, alongside more modern guides and resources for practitioners.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of appreciation for the book list and significant skepticism regarding the concept of "Design Thinking" itself. While several users thanked the original poster or shared additional book recommendations—such as *Don't Make Me Think* by Steve Krug for web design, *The Design of Design* by Fred Brooks, and *Creative Confidence*—the core debate centered on the validity and utility of Design Thinking as a discipline.

A prominent critique, articulated by user `gond`, argued that Design Thinking is an oversimplified and compartmentalized subset of the broader, more holistic field of Systems Thinking. This sparked a debate on the practicality of each approach; one user countered that while Systems Thinking might be complex and difficult to apply, Design Thinking offers a pragmatic and easily operationalized framework for product design. Other commenters questioned the definition of Design Thinking, suggesting it is often just a rebranding of traditional design principles to separate them from purely visual aesthetics.

Individual book critiques also featured prominently. One user found *The Design of Everyday Things*—often cited as a foundational text—to be overly academic and lacking in practical application for developers, a sentiment that prompted a recommendation for the more hands-on *Refactoring UI*. Another user humorously misinterpreted the article's title before a link to a Wikipedia page on garden-path sentences corrected the misunderstanding. Overall, the discussion balanced a shared interest in design literature with a critical examination of the terminology and theories that define the field.

## [It looks like the status/need-triage label was removed](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/16728)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46721179

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the `google-gemini/gemini-cli` repository where a bot named `gemini-cli[bot]` entered an infinite loop. The bot repeatedly added and then removed the `status/need-triage` label from the issue, leaving contradictory explanatory comments each time. The loop ran for approximately 4,600 iterations before being stopped, generating a massive volume of notifications and activity on the thread.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the absurdity of the situation and the broader implications of AI automation failures. Commenters described the event as a "classic CI bug" or a feedback loop where two bots (or the same bot acting on its own changes) failed to recognize they were interacting with themselves. Several users expressed disappointment that the future of AI is "this stupid," while others humorously noted that the bot's actions were technically useful, saving a human from manually adding and removing a label 4,600 times.

Technical and logistical concerns were also raised. Users speculated on the cost of the inference calls required to generate thousands of comments, questioning who was paying for the compute. There was also concern about the volume of email notifications sent to repository maintainers—potentially tens of thousands of emails in a short period. The conversation frequently referenced a similar recent incident in the same repository, suggesting this is a recurring issue with the specific bot or automation setup. Finally, commenters debated whether this was a failure of the LLM's reasoning or simply a lack of "loop detection" in the underlying CI rules, with some noting that LLMs lack a sense of self and cannot inherently recognize they are replying to themselves.

## [I was banned from Claude for scaffolding a Claude.md file?](https://hugodaniel.com/posts/claude-code-banned-me/)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 182 | **ID:** 46723384

> **Article:** The article details the author's experience of being banned from using Claude Code CLI. The author speculates that the ban was triggered by their workflow, which involved "scaffolding" a `CLAUDE.md` file by having multiple instances of Claude interact with and evaluate each other's control files. This process may have been flagged as a "prompt injection" attack by Anthropic's automated moderation systems. The author expresses frustration at the lack of recourse, the "black box" nature of the ban, and the absence of a meaningful support channel to appeal the decision.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the author's narrative and focuses on broader issues with AI service providers. A significant portion of commenters express confusion about the author's actual workflow, suggesting the described "scaffolding" process was more complex than the author let on and may have legitimately triggered security heuristics. Many users point out that the author is merely guessing about the reason for the ban, as Anthropic provided no specific explanation.

The conversation quickly pivots to a widespread frustration with the lack of human support from AI companies like Anthropic. Commenters share their own negative experiences with automated bans and non-existent appeal processes. This leads to a debate on the risks of relying on closed-source AI services, with several users advocating for running local, open-source models to maintain control and avoid arbitrary platform bans. A notable sub-thread critiques the author's writing style as overly verbose and emblematic of a trend where simple ideas are inflated into long-form blog posts.

The post reflects on the project's long history, its engineering challenges, and its ongoing mission to achieve binary compatibility with Windows applications and drivers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the anniversary is largely reflective and pragmatic, acknowledging the project's impressive technical dedication while questioning its practical viability in the modern computing landscape.

A central theme is the comparison between ReactOS and Wine/Proton. Many commenters argue that Wine (and its gaming-focused fork Proton) has become the more practical solution for running Windows software, particularly on Linux. While ReactOS aims for kernel-level driver compatibility—a unique advantage—commenters note that Wine has made significant inroads with user-space applications and modern games, areas where ReactOS currently lags. Some view ReactOS as a noble but largely academic exercise, similar to the GNU Hurd, that has passed its window of opportunity for mainstream adoption.

The discussion also touches on the project's future and potential hurdles. There is a recurring sentiment that the project is chronically under-resourced, with users daydreaming about billionaire sponsorship or corporate backing. However, the feasibility of using AI tools like Claude to accelerate development is met with skepticism. Commenters point out that because ReactOS contributors must legally affirm they have never seen leaked Windows source code, using AI models potentially trained on such leaks would jeopardize the project's "clean room" implementation status and expose it to legal risk from Microsoft.

Finally, the conversation explores the philosophical and practical use cases for ReactOS. While some see it as a vital tool for preserving legacy hardware or offering a truly open-source alternative to Windows, others argue that for most users, simply using Windows, older versions for retro computing, or Linux with Wine covers their needs. The thread concludes with a mix of nostalgia and cautious optimism, with some users noting that recent progress, such as the inclusion of a package manager, suggests the project is slowly moving beyond a "toy façade."

## [Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers](https://lambdaland.org/posts/2026-01-21_tree-sitter_vs_lsp/)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46719899

> **Article:** The article compares Tree-sitter and Language Server Protocol (LSP) for code editing features. It argues that Tree-sitter is a fast, error-tolerant parser generator ideal for syntax highlighting, structural editing, and creating custom languages due to its incremental parsing and ease of iteration. In contrast, LSP provides deep semantic understanding (like type information and cross-file references) but can introduce latency. The author suggests they are complementary: Tree-sitter for immediate, syntax-based feedback and LSP for semantic intelligence, noting that some LSPs even use Tree-sitter internally for parsing.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise, emphasizing that Tree-sitter and LSP serve different, often complementary roles. A key technical point is performance: Tree-sitter offers near-instantaneous syntax highlighting on the main thread, while LSP semantic tokens are asynchronous and can cause latency or "color shifting." Consequently, the ideal setup is often a hybrid—using Tree-sitter for immediate lexical highlighting and LSP for slower, semantic enhancements (e.g., distinguishing mutable vs. immutable variables in Rust).

Commenters also clarified misconceptions. One user noted that the absence of a specific parser in a package manager (like Arch's) doesn't mean it doesn't exist, pointing to broader repositories. Another highlighted Tree-sitter's utility beyond editing, such as for developing custom languages. The conversation also touched on the value of human-written articles versus AI-generated content, with users appreciating the author's transparency. For a user building a browser-based editor, a detailed response explained that Tree-sitter's C-based parsers can be compiled to WASM for performance, but implementing language features on top remains a significant task.

## [Convert potentially dangerous PDFs to safe PDFs](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46712815

> **Article:** The article links to the "Dangerzone" project by Freedom of the Press, a tool designed to convert potentially malicious documents (like PDFs, images, and Office files) into safe, flat PDFs. It works by rendering the document as a rasterized image inside a secure, isolated container (using gVisor) and then reconstructing it as a PDF. This process strips away any embedded executables, scripts, or active content, protecting users from exploits targeting vulnerabilities in document parsing software. The tool is intended for high-risk users, such as journalists, who need to open files from untrusted sources.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the necessity of such a tool, alternative methods for handling untrusted files, and specific use cases.

A primary debate is whether simply using a "safe" or open-source viewer (like Atrl) is sufficient. Commenters explain that any document parser is vulnerable to memory corruption exploits, citing the infamous NSO Group iMessage zero-click exploit as an example. The maintainers of Dangerzone clarify that their tool mitigates this by performing the conversion in an unprivileged, hardened container, making a successful attack significantly more difficult than compromising a standard viewer.

Users also discussed alternative, simpler methods for sanitizing files, such as uploading them to Google Drive or using other online converters. However, there was skepticism about the effectiveness of these methods, with users questioning whether services like Drive actually transform the file or simply render it in a sandbox, leaving the original malicious code intact.

Several commenters explored the tool's limitations and potential side benefits. One user noted that the tool is not designed for leakers trying to remove watermarks, as its purpose is solely to prevent code execution, not to anonymize a document's origin. Another user pointed out that the conversion process can be an effective way to compress large PDFs generated from applications like Excel, though this comes at the cost of potential OCR errors and loss of copyable text.

Finally, there was some discussion about the tool's user interface, with one user wishing for a more robust command-line interface for integration into automated workflows, while others pointed out that the tool is primarily intended for end-users processing individual files.

## [Macron says €300B in EU savings sent to the US every year will be invested in EU](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qjtvtl/macron_says_300_billion_in_european_savings_flown/)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 163 | **ID:** 46722594

> **Article:** French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announced a plan to retain and attract European capital. He stated that €300 billion in European savings are currently sent to the United States annually and that the EU will implement policies to invest this capital within Europe instead. The goal is to create a more competitive European financial market and reduce reliance on US investment vehicles.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of Macron's announcement, with commenters questioning the feasibility and underlying economic logic of the plan. The conversation touches on several key themes:

*   **Economic Feasibility:** Several users challenged the premise that capital simply "flows" to the US without a corresponding return flow, noting that in a floating exchange rate system, the situation is more complex. There is a general sentiment that without structural changes to improve investment returns and opportunities in the EU, capital will naturally seek higher yields elsewhere.
*   **Regulatory and Tax Barriers:** A recurring point is that the EU's high taxes and heavy regulation are the primary drivers of capital flight. Users suggest that lowering capital gains taxes and reducing bureaucratic hurdles would be more effective than Macron's announcement.
*   **Political Skepticism:** Commenters view the statement as political posturing rather than a concrete policy, with some suggesting it is aimed more at international audiences (like the US under Trump) than at solving domestic EU issues. There is also cynicism regarding the EU's ability to execute such reforms, citing historical difficulties like the stalled Mercosur trade deal.
*   **Cultural Context:** The discussion briefly diverges into a comparison of savings rates between Europe and the US, with European users expressing surprise at how many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, while others debate the methodology behind the statistics.
*   **Minor Tangents:** A few comments were off-topic, including a discussion about Macron wearing sunglasses (attributed to an eye infection) and a brief, dismissive mention of Paul Graham and Y Combinator.

## [Why does SSH send 100 packets per keystroke?](https://eieio.games/blog/ssh-sends-100-packets-per-keystroke/)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 113 | **ID:** 46723990

> **Article:** The article investigates why SSH connections send a high volume of packets (approx. 100 per keystroke) when used for an interactive game. The author discovers this is due to SSH's keystroke timing obfuscation feature, which intentionally adds "chaff" packets to mask the timing of user input, preventing traffic analysis attacks. While this is a security feature, it creates significant overhead for a game requiring low latency. The author modifies the Go crypto/ssh library to disable this feature, reducing packet count and CPU usage, and discusses the trade-offs between security and performance in this specific context.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around the technical and security implications of the article's findings, with a notable side-thread about AI writing styles.

Key technical points include:
*   **TCP Optimization:** Commenters suggest using `TCP_CORK` or disabling `TCP_NODELAY` to further reduce packet count, explaining how these kernel-level options buffer data to send fuller packets.
*   **Security vs. Performance:** There is a strong debate about disabling keystroke obfuscation. While the author's use case (a game) justifies the performance gain, several users warn that in production environments, this feature is critical for preventing traffic analysis attacks that could compromise typed data.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Some suggest that for a high-performance game, using UDP with a custom crypto/reliability layer (like QUIC or GameNetworkingSockets) or even a simple telnet connection (if security is irrelevant) would be more appropriate than hacking SSH.
*   **SSH Performance:** One user questions the efficiency of the SSH implementation itself, noting that the observed packet processing rate seems unusually slow for a modern core, even with encryption overhead.

A separate, humorous theme emerged regarding the author's use of AI (Claude) for assistance. Several commenters mocked the repetitive, overly confident phrasing common in AI-generated text (e.g., "smoking gun," "brutal truth," em dashes), treating the article's writing style as a "smoking gun" for AI involvement.
