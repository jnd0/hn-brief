# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-22

## [We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports](https://curl.se/.well-known/security.txt)
**Score:** 846 | **Comments:** 537 | **ID:** 46717556

> **Article:** The linked article is the security.txt file for the cURL project, which is a standard file for disclosing security vulnerabilities. The file has been updated with a new, strongly worded policy warning that the project will "ban you and ridicule you in public" for submitting "crap reports," specifically citing the recent flood of low-quality, AI-generated reports as the reason for this stance. This follows cURL's recent decision to eliminate its bug bounty program to reduce the financial incentive for such spam.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with cURL's frustration, viewing the policy as a justified response to a new era of AI-generated spam. The conversation centers on the core problem: the asymmetry between the low cost of generating reports with LLMs and the high, non-scalable cost for human maintainers to review them.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **The New Challenge of AI:** Many commenters see this as an inevitable consequence of accessible AI tools, which have amplified a pre-existing problem of low-effort reports from students and others seeking to game systems like Hacktoberfest or university credit. The issue is that AI makes it cheap to generate plausible-sounding nonsense, overwhelming maintainers.
*   **Effectiveness of Rudeness:** A debate arose on whether ridicule will be an effective deterrent. Some argue it's a fair and direct way to discourage bad actors. However, a counterpoint was raised that the submitters of AI slop are often not personally invested; they simply copy and paste the maintainer's rude response back into the LLM, feeling no personal "ego hit." This approach might deter genuine but inexperienced contributors while failing to stop the AI spam itself.
*   **Alternative Solutions:** Commenters proposed other strategies to combat the problem, such as moving discussions to a less accessible platform, requiring all issues to start as discussions (a "gatekeeping" approach some dislike), or restricting issue and PR creation to trusted contributors.
*   **Broader Context:** The issue is framed as part of a wider trend of AI-generated content polluting various fields, from academic literature to online forums, often driven by financial or academic incentives rather than genuine interest.

## [Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/)
**Score:** 573 | **Comments:** 420 | **ID:** 46712678

> **Article:** The article, "Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant," presents research from MIT's Media Lab on the cognitive effects of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for essay writing. The study tracked participants over four months, dividing them into groups using LLMs, search engines, or no tools (brain-only). Key findings indicate that LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. While they were the most efficient at writing, they demonstrated the lowest brain engagement and struggled to accurately quote their own work. The research suggests a "cognitive debt" where the convenience of AI assistance leads to a degradation of critical thinking, memory, and original cognitive processes, raising concerns about long-term educational implications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with users debating the validity of the study and the real-world implications of AI on cognition and the tech industry. A central point of contention is the study's methodology; some users dismiss it as a "non-study" or "laughably bad," arguing that the observed effects could simply be due to participants becoming more invested in a task upon repetition. However, others counter that the study's finding that cognitive engagement remained low even after LLM users switched to unaided writing is a significant and concerning result.

A major theme is the long-term impact on the software development industry. One user presents a detailed argument for an impending "massive talent crunch," predicting that the automation of junior-level tasks by AI will cripple the pipeline of future senior engineers, creating a shortage of experienced developers. This view is met with both agreement and skepticism, with some noting it's a common "greybeard" prediction that has historically been proven wrong, while others feel the current "dumbing down" effect is fundamentally different.

The conversation also explores the practical use of AI in programming. Many developers express a distinction between "vibe coding" (hands-off, delegative use) and a more engaged, collaborative process where the developer remains in control and understands the output. There's a consensus that while AI is useful for boilerplate and code comprehension, it can be a poor partner for complex tasks, often steering developers into "quagmires" with subtle errors. The general sentiment leans towards caution, with users advocating for using AI as a learning aid rather than a replacement for critical thinking, to avoid accumulating the "cognitive debt" highlighted in the article.

## [Show HN: Sweep, Open-weights 1.5B model for next-edit autocomplete](https://huggingface.co/sweepai/sweep-next-edit-1.5B)
**Score:** 494 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46713106

> **Project:** Sweep is an open-weights 1.5B parameter model designed for "next-edit" autocomplete, a task where the model predicts the next edit a developer will make rather than just completing text. It is based on Qwen2.5-Coder and was trained using a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve syntax and semantic correctness. The project is released on Hugging Face, and the team has published a blog post detailing their training data generation and methodology, claiming it was trained at a low cost.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on clarifying the model's technical approach, its practical integration, and its competitive positioning. Users were curious about the distinction between "next-edit" and Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) models, with one commenter speculating that FIM fills text between existing blocks, while next-edit predicts the subsequent change. There was significant interest in editor integrations, with community members quickly creating or suggesting plugins for Sublime Text, VS Code, and Neovim, and others asking about Monaco and JetBrains support.

Commenters also debated the model's value and performance. While some praised the technical details in the accompanying blog post, others were skeptical of its novelty, noting it is based on Qwen2.5-Coder and questioning if the release was primarily for "resume embellishment." A moderator intervened to discourage shallow dismissals. Regarding performance, users compared it to the base Qwen2.5-Coder-7B model, noting that while the 1.5B version offers a modest improvement, a hypothetical 7B version would be a "game changer." Finally, there was technical discussion on how reinforcement learning helps the model learn semantics beyond what constrained decoding can achieve, and questions about the low training cost.

## [GPTZero finds 100 new hallucinations in NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers](https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/)
**Score:** 476 | **Comments:** 256 | **ID:** 46720395

> **Article:** The article from GPTZero reports that its AI detection tool has identified 100 "hallucinated" citations (fabricated references to non-existent papers, authors, or sources) within papers accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 conference. The findings suggest that authors are increasingly using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate content without proper verification, resulting in plausible-sounding but factually incorrect scientific references. The article highlights a growing crisis of integrity in academic publishing, where AI-generated errors are slipping past the peer-review process.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses significant alarm and cynicism regarding the findings, focusing on the degradation of scientific integrity and the systemic failures that allow such errors to occur.

**Erosion of Scientific Trust**
Commenters view these AI hallucinations as a dangerous escalation of existing problems in research, such as data falsification and p-hacking. There is a strong sentiment that this will make it harder to distinguish legitimate science from "slop," potentially harming the credibility of the entire field. Many commenters express anger toward researchers using LLMs without disclosure, viewing it as academic fraud.

**Systemic Failures in Peer Review**
A major theme is the failure of the peer-review process. Users debate whether reviewers are negligent or simply overburdened. Several reviewers chimed in to explain that verifying every citation is often impossible due to time constraints and the sheer volume of submissions. The consensus is that the academic system relies on a baseline of trust, which is now being exploited. Some speculate that reviewers themselves might be using AI, leading to a "blind leading the blind" scenario.

**The "Base Rate" Problem and Detector Reliability**
Skeptics questioned the methodology of GPTZero. They argued that citation errors (fake names, typos) likely existed before the rise of LLMs, and without a baseline comparison of pre-2020 papers, it is difficult to definitively blame AI. There is also low confidence in AI detection tools themselves, with users suggesting they are prone to false positives and should not be treated as definitive proof of wrongdoing.

**Proposed Solutions and Future Outlook**
The discussion offered several potential remedies:
*   **Reproducibility as a Standard:** A shift in culture toward requiring reproducible code (the "PoC or GTFO" approach) rather than just textual descriptions.
*   **Automated Screening:** Integrating citation-checking tools into the submission process to catch obvious hallucinations before human review.
*   **Stricter Consequences:** A call for severe penalties, including criminal charges, for research fraud to act as a deterrent.

Ultimately, the community views this as a symptom of a broader issue: the "publish or perish" culture in academia, where optics and volume often outweigh substance.

## [Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/)
**Score:** 422 | **Comments:** 470 | **ID:** 46713924

> **Article:** The article, authored by a group of computer scientists and security experts, argues that internet voting is inherently insecure and should not be used in public elections. The core thesis is that the fundamental challenges of securing a voting system over the internet—such as protecting against malware, ensuring voter anonymity, and providing universal verifiability—are currently unsolvable. The authors contend that the risks of large-scale fraud, voter coercion, and privacy violations introduced by internet voting far outweigh any potential benefits in convenience or speed. The piece serves as a formal declaration from security professionals warning against the adoption of such systems, emphasizing that traditional paper-based methods, despite their own flaws, offer superior security and public trust.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly supportive of the article's conclusion, with a strong consensus favoring paper-based voting systems over internet-based methods. The primary themes revolve around the importance of trust, verifiability, and the inherent vulnerabilities of digital systems.

A significant portion of the comments champions the simplicity and reliability of paper ballots. Users point to real-world examples like Australia and India, where paper-based elections are conducted at scale with high public trust. The Australian model, in particular, is praised for its compulsory attendance, manual processes, and robust oversight, which collectively ensure integrity. There is a shared sentiment that the "hanging chad" incident from the 2000 US election, while a failure of paper, is far less catastrophic than the potential for undetectable, large-scale fraud inherent in internet voting systems.

The discussion also delves into the core principles of election security. Multiple commenters argue that trust is the most critical feature of an election, and that any system, even a less efficient one, is preferable if it enhances public confidence. The move to electronic and internet voting is seen as a step backward in this regard, making it easier for malicious actors to manipulate results while making it harder for the public to verify outcomes. The Estonian internet voting system is frequently cited as a cautionary tale, with a link provided to research detailing its significant security flaws.

Technical solutions are briefly explored but quickly met with skepticism. One commenter proposes a system of government-issued cryptographic tokens, but this is immediately challenged by concerns over voter coercion (e.g., a spouse forcing another to vote a certain way) and the practical difficulties of managing such a system securely. The conversation also touches on the tension between security and accessibility, with one user questioning if improved efficiency from electronic methods could boost voter turnout, though this is a minority view.

Finally, the discussion exhibits a meta-layer of commentary about the nature of HN itself. One user predicts that pro-internet voting "propaganda" will eventually flood the comments and suppress the initial, paper-supportive consensus, highlighting a perceived pattern of opinion manipulation on the platform. This underscores the depth of distrust not only in internet voting but also in the digital information ecosystem.

## [In Europe, Wind and Solar Overtake Fossil Fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels)
**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 406 | **ID:** 46719491

> **Article:** A Yale e360 article reports a significant energy milestone in Europe: for the first time, wind and solar power combined generated more electricity than all fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil) in 2022. The data, sourced from Ember, indicates renewables accounted for 34% of the EU's electricity, while fossil fuels dropped to 33%. The shift was driven by a rapid expansion of renewable capacity, a decline in electricity demand due to the energy crisis, and reduced nuclear output in countries like France. The article frames this as a structural change rather than a temporary anomaly, highlighting that the transition is accelerating due to compounding growth in solar and wind installations.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, with users debating the geopolitical, economic, and technical implications of Europe's energy transition.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on geopolitics, specifically the relationship between China, Russia, and Europe. One user speculated that Europe's shift away from fossil fuels could reduce its dependence on Russian energy, potentially altering China's calculus regarding its alliance with Russia. However, other commenters argued that China benefits from Russia's self-isolation and economic decline, as it allows China to exploit Russian resources and gain a dependent partner. The discussion also touched on how the ongoing war in Ukraine distracts China, giving it "free rein" to pursue its own territorial ambitions, such as in Taiwan.

The economic viability and cost of renewables sparked a heated debate. Several users, particularly from North America and Australia, shared personal anecdotes of cost-effective residential solar installations, arguing that solar is a "no-brainer" investment. In contrast, European commenters expressed concern over high electricity prices, which they attributed to green policies and taxes, suggesting these costs make European industries less competitive globally. Some countered that high energy prices in Europe are partly due to a lack of domestic fossil fuel reserves and that energy independence has a security value that transcends immediate costs. The discussion also highlighted the political dimension, with users accusing politicians of being influenced by either fossil fuel lobbies or Chinese interests.

Technically, users dissected the scope of the report. A key point was that the data pertains only to electricity generation, not total energy consumption, which includes transportation and heating. Commenters noted that electrifying these sectors (via EVs and heat pumps) is the next major challenge. However, the outlook was optimistic, with users pointing to the rapid adoption of EVs and heat pumps. The role of battery storage was identified as a critical factor in solving the intermittency problem, with some predicting that battery-backed renewables would soon become cheaper than gas peakers for meeting evening peak demand. The potential of sodium-ion batteries to further drive down storage costs was also mentioned.

Finally, the discussion included a skeptical perspective, with one user noting that past headlines about renewables overtaking fossils often came with significant caveats (e.g., comparing only to coal, or for a single day). However, many agreed that this instance was different, representing a genuine, sustained annual trend driven by years of compounding growth.

## [eBay explicitly bans AI "buy for me" agents in user agreement update](https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-bans-ai-agents-updates-arbitration-user-agreement-feb-2026/)
**Score:** 292 | **Comments:** 313 | **ID:** 46711574

> **Article:** eBay has updated its user agreement to explicitly ban the use of AI agents that make purchases on behalf of users ("buy for me" agents). The update, effective February 2026, is framed as a measure to prevent unauthorized automated transactions. The article suggests this is likely a protective legal move by eBay to limit liability and maintain control over the purchasing process, rather than a technical crackdown intended to catch every instance of browser automation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the motivations behind the ban and the practical realities of enforcing it. The consensus is that eBay's primary concern is financial and operational risk; AI agents are prone to making mistakes, leading to chargebacks and customer support headaches that eBay would rather avoid. Several users speculated that this is a defensive legal maneuver—establishing a clause to deny support for issues caused by third-party automation—rather than a proactive effort to detect and ban users.

Enforcement was a major point of debate. While some argued that eBay's sophisticated fingerprinting could easily detect non-human behavior, others countered that determined users could bypass these measures, making the ban difficult to enforce technically. The discussion also highlighted a perceived double standard, with users noting that while "buy for me" bots are banned, long-standing "sniper" bidding bots remain tolerated because they keep users engaged on the platform.

Finally, the conversation touched on the utility of AI shopping agents. While some commenters struggled to identify a legitimate use case beyond high-volume flipping or arbitrage, others pointed out potential accessibility benefits, such as assisting blind users. The thread concluded with broader grievances regarding eBay's fee structure and the platform's decline in user trust, with many commenters expressing a preference for alternatives like Facebook Marketplace.

## [Qwen3-TTS Family Is Now Open Sourced: Voice Design, Clone, and Generation](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115)
**Score:** 291 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46719229

> **Article:** Alibaba's Qwen team has open-sourced the Qwen3-TTS family, a suite of models for text-to-speech, voice design, and voice cloning. The release includes models capable of generating speech in multiple languages, cross-lingual voice cloning (e.g., cloning a voice to speak a different language), and high-fidelity voice generation. The team provides samples on their blog and has made the models available on Hugging Face, complete with code examples for implementation.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is a mix of technical enthusiasm and ethical concern. Many users were immediately struck by the quality of the voice cloning, with several commenters noting that the English audio samples had a distinct "anime voice" or "Miyazaki-style dub" quality, suggesting the training data may have been heavy on such content. The technology's realism was a major point of discussion, with users sharing use cases ranging from creative (restoring old radio plays) to deeply personal (a deceased grandmother reading a bedtime story).

However, this realism also sparked significant alarm. Multiple commenters described the tech as "terrifying" and warned that it contributes to a future where digital content cannot be trusted without cryptographic verification. The ease of access was highlighted by a user who successfully cloned their own voice using a Hugging Face demo, which they found both remarkable and unsettling. On the implementation side, users discussed practical hurdles, such as running the models locally on non-NVIDIA hardware (like Macs) and the availability of demos for testing. The discussion also briefly veered into unrelated topics, including the desire for more powerful coding models and criticism of other AI company leaders.

## [Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over "heroes"](https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 309 | **ID:** 46719222

> **Article:** The article, sourced from a blog post, recounts a story about author Douglas Adams explaining the cultural difference between American and British heroes to a group of American studio executives. Adams posits that American heroes are defined by their competence, autonomy, and ability to triumph over adversity. In contrast, British heroes are often reluctant, bumbling figures who are "victims of circumstance" and find themselves in situations beyond their control. The British audience, Adams argues, derives humor and sympathy from watching these flawed characters struggle and often fail, whereas an American audience would find such a character frustrating and unsatisfying. The core of the divide is the American celebration of success versus the British appreciation for the "glorious failure."
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates and expands upon Douglas Adams's observation, with commenters exploring its nuances and offering counter-examples.

Many users agreed with the premise, citing cultural touchstones to illustrate the divide. The contrast between the UK and US versions of "The Office" was frequently mentioned, with the UK's "gloomy" aesthetic and pessimistic protagonist being a stark contrast to the US's more optimistic and "sunny" adaptation. Similarly, some commenters noted that modern American shows like "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" have become more "British-compatible" by focusing on terrible people facing comeuppance, a theme of failure.

The conversation also explored how this cultural lens applies to other media. One user pointed out that globally successful British YA series like "Harry Potter" feature protagonists with traditionally American heroic traits (autonomy, mastery, purpose), which may explain their popularity in the US. Another commenter highlighted the contrast with Hayao Miyazaki's characters, who are often morally complex and defy simple hero/villain binaries, offering a different perspective from both American and British archetypes.

However, several users offered counterpoints to the article's thesis. The "maker" community in the US (e.g., woodworkers, machinists on YouTube) was cited as a space that celebrates the process and humor of failure, showing a British-like sensibility. The classic American character Charlie Brown was also presented as a "lovable loser" archetype who endures constant failure, challenging the idea that Americans only value triumphant heroes. Some commenters argued that the premise is an oversimplification, noting that both nations have diverse cultural outputs and that it's difficult to distill entire countries' attitudes based on one anecdote.

## [Threat actors expand abuse of Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://www.jamf.com/blog/threat-actors-expand-abuse-of-visual-studio-code/)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 265 | **ID:** 46713526

> **Article:** The article from Jamf details how threat actors are increasingly abusing Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for malicious purposes. The primary attack vector involves embedding malicious configuration files, such as `tasks.json`, within a project repository. When a developer opens this project in VS Code, they are prompted to "trust" the folder to enable all features. If trust is granted, VS Code automatically processes these configuration files, which can be crafted to execute arbitrary commands on the host system. This method is effective because it leverages a legitimate feature of the editor, making it difficult for users to detect. The article highlights that this tactic is part of a broader trend where developers are targeted through their tools, turning a trusted environment into a vector for malware execution.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the security implications of VS Code's design and the broader trend of using web technologies for desktop applications. A primary theme was the trade-off between convenience and security. Several users expressed concern that a text editor could execute code simply by opening a folder, comparing the "trust this folder" prompt to the historical risks of macro-enabled Office documents. The `tasks.json` file was specifically identified as a major security flaw, with users questioning the decision to allow automatic processing of such configurations.

A significant portion of the debate revolved around the suitability of different development environments. While the original poster questioned why VS Code had superseded Eclipse (suggesting the decline of Java was a factor), other commenters strongly defended Eclipse's capabilities and expressed a preference for more robust, JVM-based IDEs like JetBrains. This led to a broader critique of VS Code's architecture, which is built on web technologies (Electron). Critics argued that this approach creates a large attack surface and that sandboxing is often sacrificed for convenience, a problem they felt was less prevalent in applications built on the Java Virtual Machine. However, it was noted that even JVM-based IDEs can be vulnerable when they execute arbitrary build scripts (e.g., Gradle, Maven).

The conversation also explored potential solutions and alternatives. Many commenters advocated for better application sandboxing and the use of containerized development environments as a default workflow to isolate projects and protect the host system. The security of other modern editors like Zed was also briefly scrutinized, with one user pointing out that Zed had recently removed several tool calls from its default "always allow" list, indicating that this is a widespread challenge for the entire category of modern, extensible editors.

## [Significant US farm losses persist, despite federal assistance](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/significant-farm-losses-persist-despite-federal-assistance)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 373 | **ID:** 46713929

> **Article:** The article from the American Farm Bureau Federation (a US agricultural lobbying group) argues that despite federal assistance, US farms are experiencing significant and persistent financial losses. It likely attributes these losses to a combination of factors including high input costs (fuel, fertilizer), adverse weather conditions, and volatile market prices. The piece frames federal aid as insufficient to offset the underlying economic pressures facing the agricultural sector, suggesting a structural crisis rather than a temporary downturn.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly pivots from the article's specific data to broader debates about the structure, economics, and politics of US agriculture. A central theme is the political allegiance of farmers; several commenters note that farmers overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump, despite policies like tariffs that arguably harmed their export markets (particularly soybeans to China). This leads to a debate on whether this voting behavior stems from cultural identity, misinformation, or a perception that Republicans better protect rural interests, with some commenters expressing frustration that farmers continue to support politicians whose policies cause them economic harm.

Economically, the conversation splits into two main camps regarding subsidies. One side argues that agricultural subsidies are necessary for national security (food independence), price stability for consumers, and the political reality of rural voting power. The opposing view, citing examples like New Zealand's deregulation, contends that permanent subsidies stifle innovation, create inefficiencies, and prevent necessary market corrections, ultimately making the industry weaker. A specific comparison is drawn to Canada's "Supply Management" system for dairy, which limits production to maintain prices and avoid bailouts, contrasting it with the US system of overproduction followed by government intervention.

Finally, structural issues within the industry are highlighted. A major point is the "squeeze" on farmers by monopolistic corporations—seed companies (Monsanto/Bayer), machinery manufacturers (John Deere), and massive food processors (Cargill)—that control input costs and set low prices for produce, capturing most of the value. This leads to a discussion on the decline of the family farm versus the efficiency of large-scale agribusiness, with commenters debating whether small farms are economically viable or merely a romanticized ideal. The consensus among many is that the current system is broken, benefiting corporate intermediaries more than the farmers themselves.

## [Doctors in Brazil using tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/brazilian-city-uses-tilapia-fish-skin-treat-burn-victims)
**Score:** 250 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46715600

> **Article:** The article from PBS NewsHour details how doctors in Brazil are using sterilized tilapia fish skin as a novel treatment for burn victims. The fish skin is processed to remove scales and fat, then sterilized and dried. When applied to burns, it acts as a natural bandage that retains moisture, reduces pain, and protects the wound from infection. The treatment is significantly cheaper than traditional synthetic or human skin grafts, and the raw material is abundant, as it is often considered a waste product by the tilapia farming industry. The article notes that while the treatment is gaining traction in Brazil, its adoption in the US is hindered by strict FDA regulations and the existing supply of donated human skin.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this topic is multifaceted, touching on regulatory differences, media representation, scientific validity, and practical applications.

A significant portion of the conversation centers on the regulatory and economic barriers to adopting this treatment in the United States. One commenter links the high cost and slow adoption of such innovations in the US to strict FDA scrutiny, invoking Milton Friedman's critiques of the agency. Others question whether this is due to lobbying or the influence of animal rights groups, though one user counters that Brazil's regulatory body is even stricter than the FDA, suggesting the issue may be more complex.

Many commenters immediately recognized the treatment from popular culture, specifically citing episodes of the medical dramas *Grey's Anatomy* and *The Good Doctor* from 2017 and 2019. While some used this to point out that the news is "old," others defended its relevance, noting that the technique's existence for several years doesn't diminish its importance or novelty to a wider audience.

The scientific efficacy of the treatment is also debated. One commenter expressed skepticism, claiming that metastudies show tilapia skin offers no significant advantage over traditional silver sulfadiazine ointments, essentially acting as a placebo. However, another user countered with a study on collagen patches (the primary component of fish skin), which showed positive results in reducing the need for skin grafts and improving patient comfort. Anecdotal evidence from a user who benefited from silver cream was also shared.

Finally, the discussion explored practical aspects. Users speculated on why tilapia is the fish of choice, concluding that its low cost and massive global farming output make it an ideal and sustainable material. The conversation also included lighthearted cultural references, such as jokes from *Dune* and *One Piece*, and a humorous take on the idea of a "God Emperor of Brazil."

## [Design Thinking Books You Must Read](https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-books/)
**Score:** 240 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46718061

> **Article:** The article "Design Thinking Books You Must Read" from Designorate.com presents a curated list of essential books on the topic of design thinking. It aims to guide readers through foundational and influential literature in the field, likely covering concepts like empathy, ideation, and prototyping to foster innovative problem-solving.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mixed and often critical reception to the article's premise. While some users appreciated the list and shared additional book recommendations like "Don't Make Me Think" and "Creative Confidence," the overall sentiment was one of skepticism.

A significant portion of the comments challenged the value and definition of "Design Thinking" itself. One user dismissed it as an oversimplified subset of the more robust "Systems Thinking," advocating for the latter's broader, more foundational approach. Others questioned what makes "Design Thinking" distinct from "good old regular design," suggesting the term is more of a branding exercise to separate conceptual design from visual output. The article's use of hyperbolic language like "Must read" was also called out as unhelpful.

Personal experiences with canonical texts were shared, with one developer finding "The Design of Everyday Things" to be overly academic and impractical, contrary to its "bible" status. The discussion also included lighthearted comments, such as a joke about misreading the article's title and a note on the author's likely human origin based on a textual inconsistency.

## [Show HN: isometric.nyc – giant isometric pixel art map of NYC](https://cannoneyed.com/isometric-nyc/)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46721802

> **Project:** The project is isometric.nyc, a massive isometric pixel art map of New York City. The creator, cannoneyed, built it entirely using AI tools (specifically "nano banana" and coding agents) without writing any code themselves. The project involved a complex workflow to generate consistent, seamless pixel art tiles, including a technique of "masking" where adjacent tiles are provided as input to ensure stylistic consistency and avoid seams. The creator also published a deep-dive article discussing the process and the implications of AI on creativity.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was multifaceted, blending technical curiosity with broader philosophical debates about AI and art. Technically, users were interested in the specific AI workflow, particularly the "masking" technique used to generate seamless tiles and the process of fine-tuning models for consistent style. There were also immediate technical issues, as the site was initially hugged to death by HN traffic, leading to CORS and rate-limiting errors, though the creator resolved this.

The philosophical debate was the most prominent theme. While many users praised the visual result as "beautiful" and "impressive," others expressed reservations. A key point of contention was the value and scale of AI-generated art. One commenter argued that the project highlights a problem of scale, where AI's ability to produce massive outputs diminishes human expression and creates societal impacts we aren't ready for. In response, others pointed to human-led large-scale projects (like a physical miniature model of NYC or a 1:1 scale recreation in Minecraft) to question the premise that the work "couldn't exist" without AI.

The creator's own framing of the project—specifically the idea that when hard tasks become easy, the differentiator becomes "love"—resonated with several commenters. This sentiment was seen as a succinct way to articulate the future role of human creativity in an AI-assisted world, shifting the focus from technical skill to intent and passion.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of admiration for the project's longevity and a pragmatic debate about its relevance and future. A dominant theme is the comparison between ReactOS and Wine/Proton. Many commenters argue that Wine, which allows Windows applications to run on Linux, has become far more practical and successful, especially for running modern software like games. They contend that ReactOS's original goal of driver compatibility is now its main differentiator, but it has also made the project's scope so large that it has missed its window of practical adoption, with some comparing it to the Hurd kernel as a noble but largely academic engineering exercise.

Another significant thread revolves around the use of AI. Commenters speculate that AI could accelerate development, but others raise a critical legal and philosophical objection: because ReactOS requires contributors to affirm they have never seen leaked Windows source code to maintain a "clean room" implementation, using AI models potentially trained on such leaks would jeopardize the project's legal standing.

The discussion also touches on the project's practical challenges, with users noting that ReactOS still struggles with modern hardware and lacks the application compatibility of Wine. There is a sense of admiration for the developers' dedication over three decades, with some users expressing a desire for corporate sponsorship or even daydreaming about personally funding the project to completion. Finally, a few comments touch on broader philosophical points, such as the "Windows effect" where open-source efforts inadvertently entrench Microsoft's dominance, and a general sentiment of wanting viable alternatives to both Windows and Linux.

## [It looks like the status/need-triage label was removed](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/16728)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46721179

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the `google-gemini/gemini-cli` repository where the `status/need-triage` label was removed. The core of the issue is a feedback loop involving the `gemini-cli` bot. The bot repeatedly added and removed the same label from the issue, posting a comment each time to explain its action. This loop occurred over 4,600 times, generating thousands of automated comments and notifications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the nature of the bug, its implications, and the broader context of AI automation failures. Commenters were largely critical and amused by the situation, viewing it as a cautionary tale for automated systems.

Key discussion points include:
*   **Nature of the Loop:** Users debated whether this was a "classic CI bug" or a unique failure of AI. One user argued that preventing an automated system from replying to itself is a fundamental step in bot design, while others countered that LLMs lack self-awareness and cannot inherently recognize their own actions in a loop.
*   **Scale and Cost:** The sheer volume of the loop (4,600 iterations) was a major point of discussion. Users calculated the potential for tens of thousands of email notifications and questioned who was paying for the significant computational cost of the repeated API calls.
*   **Recurring Problem:** It was highlighted that this was not an isolated incident. Another user linked to several other recent issues in the same repository, suggesting this is a frequent and recurring problem with the `gemini-cli` bot.
*   **Historical Parallels:** The discussion drew parallels to other automation failures, such as a classic Salesforce loop where a new ticket notification would trigger the creation of another ticket. This was used to illustrate that while the technology is new, the logical flaw is timeless.
*   **Cynical Humor:** Many comments were humorous, with users sarcastically praising the bot for its "useful" work of adding and removing labels, or lamenting that the future of AI is "this stupid."

## [Convert potentially dangerous PDFs to safe PDFs](https://github.com/freedomofpress/dangerzone)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46712815

> **Article:** The article links to Dangerzone, an open-source tool developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation. It converts potentially malicious documents (PDFs, images, etc.) into safe PDFs by rendering them as rasterized images within a secure, isolated container (using gVisor). This process strips away any embedded executable code or exploits, ensuring the recipient can view the content without risking a compromise of their system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the necessity of document sanitization, the effectiveness of Dangerzone's specific approach, and alternative methods for handling untrusted files.

A primary theme is the technical justification for the tool. Users debated whether simply opening a file in a limited, open-source viewer (like atril) is sufficient. One maintainer clarified that because most viewers are written in memory-unsafe languages like C, parsing complex file formats remains a significant attack vector. Dangerzone mitigates this by performing the rendering inside a hardened container, making exploits much more difficult to execute.

Several users discussed alternative approaches to file safety:
*   **Cloud-based solutions:** Some users mentioned uploading files to Google Drive or converting them via Google Docs as a convenient, low-effort alternative. However, others questioned whether these services actually sanitize files or simply render them in a sandboxed browser environment.
*   **Other tools:** A user promoted "preview.ninja," a free web-based alternative supporting over 300 formats. Another user mentioned "Caradoc," which uses parsing and normalization rather than rasterization.
*   **Sandboxing:** A suggestion was made to simply print documents to PDF inside a Docker container, though this was noted to be less user-friendly.

There was a distinct tangent regarding the tool's utility for "leakers" versus "recipients." One user warned that the tool does not remove forensic watermarks (such as subtle text variations) used to identify sources. Others countered that Dangerzone is designed for recipients (e.g., journalists) to safely *view* untrusted files, not for senders to anonymize them.

Finally, a user noted a practical side-effect of the tool: significant file compression. By converting complex vector documents (like Excel exports) into rasterized PDFs, file sizes can drop from megabytes to kilobytes, though this comes at the cost of selectable text accuracy.

## [Spotify won court order against Anna's Archive, taking down .org domain](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/annas-archive-said-spotify-scrape-didnt-cause-domain-suspension-it-was-wrong/)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 144 | **ID:** 46711380

> **Article:** A report from Ars Technica details how Spotify obtained a court order to suspend Anna's Archive's .org domain. The article clarifies that the suspension was not directly due to scraping activities, but rather a preemptive legal move by Spotify. Anna's Archive, a well-known shadow library, had publicly announced plans to distribute Spotify's music files, prompting Spotify to seek an ex-parte injunction under the All Writs Act to seize the domain before the archive could react or move its infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply skeptical of Spotify's legal tactics and sympathetic to Anna's Archive, though nuanced in their understanding of the situation. The conversation centers on several key themes:

**Legitimacy of Spotify's Actions:**
While many users are critical of Spotify, there is a factual correction regarding the nature of the threat. One user argues that Spotify wasn't acting on a "nebulous" fear but a specific, stated intent by Anna's Archive to host and seed Spotify's music files, making the legal action a clear-cut copyright defense rather than an abuse of process. However, others view the use of ex-parte motions and the All Writs Act as corrupt and disproportionate, especially since the site didn't host infringing files itself at the time.

**Effectiveness and Futility:**
A prevalent sentiment is that court orders are largely ineffective against foreign entities dedicated to sharing information. Users compare this to the futility of 1990s encryption export restrictions, noting that Anna's Archive will simply migrate to other domains (with Wikipedia serving as a de facto directory). The discussion highlights that while Spotify can disrupt US-based infrastructure like Cloudflare, the underlying data remains accessible.

**Corporate Motivations:**
Users debate Spotify's true motivations. Some suggest it is purely about maintaining relationships with powerful music labels ("the wrath of record companies") rather than a genuine belief that piracy threatens their subscription model. Others argue that the existence of a comprehensive, high-quality repository like Anna's Archive is fundamentally different from scattered torrents, posing a significant threat to the industry's control. There is also cynicism regarding Spotify's origins, with users noting the irony of a company that allegedly bootstrapped with pirated music now cracking down on piracy.

**User Sentiment and Alternatives:**
There is a notable undercurrent of dissatisfaction with Spotify's subscription costs, with users mentioning they have canceled or switched to free alternatives like YouTube or radio. However, the consensus is that most users lack the time or motivation to manage a local library, making piracy a niche concern for developers rather than a mass expiration threat.

## [Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers](https://lambdaland.org/posts/2026-01-21_tree-sitter_vs_lsp/)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 43 | **ID:** 46719899

> **Article:** The article "Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers" compares two technologies used in modern code editors. It positions Tree-sitter as a fast, error-tolerant parser generator primarily used for syntax highlighting and structural code analysis. In contrast, it describes Language Servers (LSP) as a protocol that provides a broader suite of semantic features (like autocompletion, go-to-definition, and refactoring) by analyzing code meaning and context. The author argues that while LSPs are powerful, Tree-sitter offers superior speed and flexibility for specific tasks like syntax highlighting and is easier to integrate into custom tools or new programming languages.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, particularly regarding performance and the capabilities of Language Servers. A central theme is the ideal integration of both tools: using Tree-sitter for immediate, high-speed syntax highlighting (lexical coloring) and relying on the asynchronous Language Server for semantic highlighting (e.g., distinguishing between mutable vs. immutable variables in Rust) and deeper analysis. Commenters noted that relying solely on LSP for highlighting can introduce latency and visual "flickering" as the server processes changes.

Several users corrected the article's premise that language support is limited, pointing to extensive third-party Tree-sitter grammars for languages like R, YAML, and Go that aren't necessarily packaged by default in distributions like Arch Linux. There was also a strong appreciation for Tree-sitter's utility in developing custom languages and powering advanced editor features like structured editing (e.g., Emacs's Combobulate).

A significant portion of the discussion diverged into a meta-commentary on the value of human-written content. Several commenters praised the author for not using AI, arguing that the act of writing forces a distillation of thought that AI-generated text lacks, thereby reducing the article's utility. Finally, a user building a browser-based editor asked for more foundational details, prompting a detailed response that explained the parsing landscape, the LSP specification, and the trade-offs between different parsing techniques.

## [From stealth blackout to whitelisting: Inside the Iranian shutdown](https://www.kentik.com/blog/from-stealth-blackout-to-whitelisting-inside-the-iranian-shutdown/)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46713444

> **Article:** The article analyzes Iran's internet shutdown during recent protests, detailing a shift from a complete "blackout" to a "whitelisting" system. The author explains that by keeping IPv4 routes active while blocking IPv6, Iranian authorities can selectively grant internet access to approved users (like security forces and elites) while denying it to the general population. This creates a "digital apartheid" and supports the government's long-term goal of transitioning to a "National Information Network" (NIN)—a sovereign, censored internet ecosystem. The piece notes that Iran has developed a surprisingly robust domestic tech infrastructure, including hyperscalers, largely due to international sanctions and a strategic push for technological self-sufficiency.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on three main themes: the technical and geopolitical implications of Iran's internet control, the broader context of the protests and government response, and the role of media and information.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on Iran's strategic development of a domestic internet ecosystem. Users note that Iran has been building its National Information Network (NIN) for years, fostering a domestic tech industry with hyperscalers like ArvanCloud. Some commenters express a degree of envy, suggesting that Western sanctions inadvertently forced Iran to develop sovereign tech capabilities that Europe, due to its reliance on US tech, lacks. However, one user challenges the claim of a "robust" ecosystem, pointing out that a cited source is outdated.

The discussion also delves into the severity of the government's crackdown. Users describe the internet shutdown as a tool for enabling mass violence, with one commenter citing high casualty figures and comparing the killing rate to the war in Ukraine. The term "digital apartheid" is used to describe the whitelisting system. There is a debate about the root causes, with some blaming Western sanctions and imperialism for exacerbating the situation, while others dismiss this as Russian trolling and emphasize the unpopularity of the Iranian regime.

Finally, the conversation touches on the failure of international media coverage. Users lament the near-total absence of foreign journalists on the ground, contrasting it with historical events like Tiananmen Square. This lack of independent reporting makes it difficult to verify claims and lends credibility to government propaganda. The discussion concludes with a practical note from an Iranian user requesting help with accessing specific services (like Google Colab) through whitelisted IPs, highlighting the real-world impact of these policies on daily life and work.
