## [Claude's new constitution](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution)
**Score:** 471 | **Comments:** 511 | **ID:** 46707572

> **Article:** Anthropic announced a new "Constitution" for its AI model, Claude, which serves as a foundational set of principles guiding its behavior. The constitution is not merely a static prompt but is integrated directly into the model's training process. Anthropic uses the constitution to generate synthetic training data, helping Claude internalize the values and reasoning behind the rules. The document aims to balance safety with helpfulness, acknowledging that being overly cautious can be as problematic as being too permissive. Alongside the announcement, Anthropic released the full text of the constitution, which notably includes considerations for Claude's potential "welfare" and describes it as a "novel kind of entity."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's new constitution reveals a spectrum of reactions, ranging from skepticism and criticism to pragmatic acceptance.

A significant portion of the comments express cynicism and concern. Some users view the constitution as a PR stunt or legal maneuver, designed to imply the models are more advanced or autonomous than they truly are. This sentiment is amplified by the language used in the constitution itself, which some found overly anthropomorphic. Comments highlighting passages about Claude's potential as a "moral patient" and its "wellbeing" were met with derision, with critics accusing Anthropic of "drinking the Kool-Aid" and engaging in fear-mongering about AGI.

Conversely, other users offered a more technical and pragmatic perspective. They interpret the constitution as a formalization of the system prompt, crucial for steering model behavior during training. Proponents argue that such documents are essential for developing reliable AI, citing Anthropic's own research on model steering. The discussion also touched on the practical implications of the constitution's principles, such as the trade-off between safety and helpfulness, and how its prose-based reasoning might generalize better than simple rule lists.

Finally, the conversation branched into related topics. Some commenters connected the official constitution to a previously leaked "soul document," confirming its authenticity. Others raised concerns about the potential for future political influence on AI principles, while one user shared a personal anecdote of Claude admitting to having "internalized a specifically progressive definition" of harmful speech, adding a layer of real-world validation to the debate over the model's inherent biases.

## [Skip is now free and open source](https://skip.dev/blog/skip-is-free/)
**Score:** 429 | **Comments:** 192 | **ID:** 46706906

> **Article:** The article announces that Skip, a tool for building native iOS and Android apps from a single Swift codebase, is now free and open source. Previously a commercial product, the company's rationale is that developer tools need to be freely accessible to achieve mass adoption. The open-source release includes the Skip tool itself (licensed under LGPLv3) and the Skipstone repository, which builds the necessary binaries. The post emphasizes that Skip leverages native toolkits—SwiftUI on iOS and Jetpack Compose on Android—ensuring full performance and native UI/UX without the overhead of web views or custom rendering engines.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was largely positive but highlighted several practical concerns and questions. The most immediate issue was a licensing oversight: the main repository initially lacked a LICENSE file, creating confusion about usage rights, though the developers quickly rectified this by adding an LGPLv3 license.

Technical inquiries focused on accessibility and platform support. Users confirmed that because Skip compiles to native UI components on both platforms, accessibility features like VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android are supported automatically. There was also interest in expanding Skip to Windows, though currently, no such support exists.

A significant point of discussion was the high system requirements, with the recommendation of 32GB of RAM. Commenters noted this is likely due to the overhead of running both the iOS and Android development toolchains simultaneously (e.g., Xcode, Android Studio, emulators) rather than Skip itself being resource-intensive.

Finally, the discussion touched on the broader economics of open-sourcing developer tools. Several users related to the difficulty of monetizing software tools, sharing personal anecdotes about the challenges of selling niche frameworks. The decision to open-source Skip was viewed as a strategic move to foster community adoption and ensure the tool's longevity.

## [Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/)
**Score:** 406 | **Comments:** 419 | **ID:** 46713924

> **Article:** The article, authored by a group of computer scientists and security experts, argues that internet voting is fundamentally insecure and should not be used in public elections. The core of the argument is that it is impossible to guarantee the security, privacy, and integrity of an internet voting system at scale. The authors contend that internet voting introduces significant and insurmountable risks, including vulnerabilities to hacking, denial-of-service attacks, malware on voter devices, and the lack of meaningful public oversight. The piece emphasizes that the perceived benefits of convenience and speed are far outweighed by the catastrophic risk of undermining public trust in election results. The article concludes with a firm recommendation to stick with paper-based systems, which, while not perfect, are far more resilient and auditable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly supportive of the article's conclusion, expressing deep skepticism about internet voting and a strong preference for paper ballots. The primary themes revolve around the importance of trust, the resilience of simple systems, and the risks of introducing digital complexity.

A significant portion of the comments praises traditional paper-based voting systems as a gold standard. Users from Australia and India describe their countries' methods, highlighting features like compulsory in-person voting, paper ballots, manual oversight, and robust election commissions. These examples are presented as evidence that "low-tech" solutions are not only functional but also inspire greater public trust. The "hanging chads" of the 2000 US election is frequently mentioned as a cautionary tale against flawed voting systems, with many commenters expressing a desire to "go back" to paper.

Trust is identified as the most critical component of an election, with many arguing that the marginal gains in efficiency from internet voting are not worth the immense risk of compromising that trust. Commenters fear that digital systems are more susceptible to large-scale, undetectable manipulation by hostile actors. The Estonian internet voting system is brought up as a real-world example, but a response links to research detailing its significant security vulnerabilities.

The discussion also explores the technical challenges and potential pitfalls of any digital system. One commenter suggests a government-run service for managing cryptographic tokens, but this is immediately countered by concerns about privacy and coercion (e.g., a voter being forced to prove how they voted). The comparison between internet voting and internet banking is raised, with others pointing out the fundamental difference in requirements: banking needs to be traceable and reversible, whereas voting must be anonymous and non-demonstrable.

Finally, there is a notable meta-discussion about the timing of the comments. One user observes that the initial comments are all anti-internet voting and wonders if "propaganda hoses" or bots will later appear to push a pro-internet voting narrative, a sentiment that reflects a broader distrust in online discourse.

## [Tell HN: Bending Spoons laid off almost everybody at Vimeo yesterday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707699)
**Score:** 391 | **Comments:** 445 | **ID:** 46707699

> **Post:** A user on Hacker News reported that Bending Spoons, the recent acquirer of Vimeo, laid off almost all of the company's staff. The post serves as a notification to the community about the significant workforce reduction at the video hosting platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly focused on Bending Spoons' established business model, which users identified as a pattern of aggressive cost-cutting following acquisitions. Commenters cited the company's previous acquisition of Evernote and WeTransfer as precedents, where mass layoffs were followed by feature removals and price increases. There was significant concern about the future of Vimeo, particularly regarding its reliability for hosting and its pricing strategy, with several users mentioning they were canceling their long-standing accounts.

Specific concerns were raised about the impact on services that rely on Vimeo's infrastructure, such as the streaming service Dropout and the public domain series MST3K. The conversation also touched on the potential fate of open-source projects associated with Vimeo, though the creator of the Psalm static analyzer clarified that the project is no longer maintained by the company and is safe. Users also debated the specific value proposition of Vimeo compared to YouTube, noting its superior branding controls and ad-free embedding, but expressing fear that these benefits would be eroded under the new ownership.

## [Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/)
**Score:** 379 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46709727

> **Article:** The article links to the Linux from Scratch (LFS) project website, which provides a step-by-step book for building a custom Linux system entirely from source code. The guide walks users through compiling the necessary toolchain (GCC, binutils), core system libraries (Glibc), and basic utilities to create a bootable, minimal Linux environment. The project also offers variations, including a version using systemd, a "Gaming" version with graphics support, and an automated build system.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters on Hacker News universally regard Linux from Scratch (LFS) as a foundational educational experience, though few recommend running it as a daily driver. The consensus is that LFS demystifies the "magic" of operating systems by forcing users to manually compile the toolchain, kernel, and core utilities, providing deep insight into dependencies, bootstrapping, and system architecture.

Many commenters shared personal anecdotes of completing the guide during their youth, noting that the time investment (often cited as a weekend or eight hours) was manageable as a student but is now difficult to justify with adult responsibilities. While the core experience remains similar to the early 2000s, modern users face a larger software stack (LLVM, Wayland, systemd) that increases complexity and compilation time.

Alternatives like Gentoo and Arch were mentioned as providing similar educational value with less friction, though LFS is viewed as the more rigorous "marathon." The discussion also touched on the practicality of maintaining a bespoke system, with users agreeing that while creating a distro is feasible, long-term maintenance is the real challenge. Ultimately, the group viewed LFS not as a practical OS choice, but as a rite of passage for anyone serious about understanding low-level computing.

## [Show HN: Sweep, Open-weights 1.5B model for next-edit autocomplete](https://huggingface.co/sweepai/sweep-next-edit-1.5B)
**Score:** 340 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46713106

> **Project:** Sweep is an open-weights 1.5B parameter code model designed for "next-edit" autocomplete, a task distinct from Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM). The model is based on Qwen2.5-Coder and was trained using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to predict the next edit a developer would make, rather than just completing the current line. The release includes technical details on the training data generation and methodology, with the goal of providing a lightweight, efficient model for code editing assistance.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was generally positive, with users expressing interest in the technical details and practical applications. Key discussion points included:

*   **Technical Clarification:** A primary question was the distinction between "next-edit" models and traditional Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) models, with users seeking to understand the specific use cases for each.
*   **Integration and Usability:** There was strong demand for editor integrations, with users specifically requesting plugins for VS Code, Monaco, Neovim, and Sublime Text. The existing JetBrains plugin was praised by a user who uses it daily.
*   **Model Foundation and Cost:** Commenters noted that the model is based on Qwen2.5-Coder, which likely made the fine-tuning process cost-effective (estimated in the low hundreds of dollars). This raised questions about the value of the release compared to the base model, though the performance gains were acknowledged.
*   **Training Methodology:** Users were curious about the data generation process for training edits and the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL). One user asked if constrained decoding could replace the RL step, leading to a detailed explanation that RL helps with semantic correctness and exploration, whereas constrained decoding primarily ensures syntactic validity.
*   **Future Releases:** There was significant interest in larger versions of the model (3B and 7B), with users hoping for future releases that could offer more substantial performance improvements.

## [Waiting for dawn in search: Search index, Google rulings and impact on Kagi](https://blog.kagi.com/waiting-dawn-search)
**Score:** 338 | **Comments:** 197 | **ID:** 46708678

> **Article:** The article "Waiting for dawn in search" from Kagi's blog outlines the immense challenges of building a modern search engine. The author argues that the search market is a natural monopoly, not just due to network effects, but because of the prohibitive cost and complexity of building a web index. The piece details how Kagi, despite its subscription model, cannot directly license Google's search index and instead relies on third-party API providers (like SerpAPI) to access Google's results. The article also discusses the ongoing US vs. Google antitrust case, expressing cautious optimism that a potential ruling could force Google to license its index, which would be a "dawn" for alternative search engines like Kagi.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes, primarily focusing on Kagi's business model and the nature of search monopolies.

A major point of contention was Kagi's reliance on third-party APIs to access Google's search results. Some commenters were critical, viewing this as "stealing" or "reselling" Google's core product without a direct license. Others defended it as a standard business practice and a necessary workaround given Google's refusal to offer a direct, whitelabeled API. This led to a debate about Kagi's privacy claims, with users noting that queries are still sent to and logged by Google, subject to its privacy policy.

The discussion also scrutinized Kagi's own claims, particularly its mention of an "own small-web index." Commenters were skeptical, suggesting it might be a minor component or a misleading description, and called for more transparency about Kagi's technical stack.

Broader themes included the difficulty of competing with Google's monopoly. While some argued that Google's dominance is simply a result of being the best product, others countered that monopolies can stifle innovation and prevent better alternatives from emerging, even if they exist. The conversation touched on potential solutions, such as government intervention, but there was little trust in a "nationalized" search engine. Finally, a minor thread discussed the linguistic dominance of "Googling" as a verb, even when using alternative services.

## [How AI destroys institutions](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-ai-destroys-institutions/)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 256 | **ID:** 46705606

> **Article:** The linked paper, "How AI Destroys Institutions," argues that Artificial Intelligence poses a fundamental threat to the integrity and function of societal institutions like higher education, medicine, and law. The author posits that these institutions rely on established, purpose-driven processes to manage complexity and reduce chaos. AI, particularly generative AI, bypasses these processes by offering frictionless, direct outputs. This undermines the institutions' authority and their role in fostering intellectual rigor and shared understanding. The paper uses examples like the FDA's use of AI and the cultural impact of Dogecoin to illustrate how AI can degrade institutional standards and create a less predictable, less trustworthy civic environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical and skeptical of the paper's thesis and academic rigor. A central theme is the questioning of the paper's quality, with several commenters pointing out that it is a draft, not peer-reviewed, and contains basic errors like misspellings and duplicate punctuation. One commenter specifically challenged the paper's research, claiming its criticism of the FDA's use of AI was based on a misinterpretation of a news article rather than primary sources, suggesting the paper is more of an "opinion piece" than a substantive academic work.

Beyond the paper's quality, the core debate revolves around institutional responsibility versus technological disruption. Many commenters argue that the paper misattributes the problem. They contend that institutions like medicine, education, and journalism have already been "fatally wounded" by their own failings—such as high costs, inaccessibility, and a loss of public trust—long before AI's rise. From this perspective, AI is not the cause of institutional decay but rather a symptom and an accelerant of a pre-existing crisis. The appeal of AI, they argue, lies in its ability to provide frictionless access to information and services that institutions have made complex and expensive.

Finally, the discussion touches on broader themes of technological disruption. Some commenters frame the issue as an inevitable byproduct of any major revolution, while others dismiss the critique as self-serving for knowledge workers like lawyers. The conversation also includes a notable counter-argument that the real threat to institutions is not AI itself, but cultural shifts that erode the rule of law and the ability to build stable systems, a point that was itself challenged by other users.

## [Scientists find a way to regrow cartilage in mice and human tissue samples](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46709179

> **Article:** A study led by Stanford Medicine researchers has discovered that blocking a protein linked to aging can reverse the natural loss of knee cartilage in older mice. The treatment involves an injection that inhibits 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), a protein that accumulates in aging cartilage and suppresses regeneration. The research, published in *Science*, also demonstrated successful cartilage regrowth in human tissue samples. The team is hopeful that human clinical trials for this treatment can be launched soon, potentially offering a new therapy for osteoarthritis.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was a mix of cautious optimism, skepticism, and personal anecdotes. A primary theme was the familiar "mice vs. humans" problem, with users humorously noting that many breakthroughs are successful in mice but often fail to translate to human trials. One commenter provided a realistic timeline, suggesting that even if successful, such a treatment would be 5-10 years from availability and potentially 20-30 years before it's affordable.

There was also a focus on the scientific details and related research. A user linked directly to the *Science* journal article, and another pointed out that a Phase 1 clinical trial for a 15-PGDH inhibitor is already underway for muscle weakness, which could provide a faster pathway to assessing its effects on cartilage. The conversation also touched on the importance of controlled growth to avoid cancer, with one commenter clarifying that cancerous growth is distinct from normal tissue regeneration.

Many comments were personal and emotional, with users sharing their own struggles with joint pain and expressing hope for a future treatment that could restore mobility and allow them to run or practice sports again. The discussion also branched out into related topics, such as the difference between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, and the potential of other supplements like hyaluronic acid. A recurring sentiment was a mix of hope for medical breakthroughs and skepticism about the long road from discovery to accessible treatment, with one user comparing cartilage regrowth to other "perpetually imminent" technologies like fusion power and room-temperature semiconductors.

## [Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 171 | **ID:** 46712678

> **Article:** The article, "Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant," presents research from MIT's Media Lab on the cognitive effects of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for writing tasks. The study tracked participants over four months, dividing them into three groups: those who wrote essays using only their own brainpower, those who used an LLM to assist them, and those who used a search engine. The findings indicate that LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. The research suggests a "cognitive debt" accumulates, where reliance on AI for writing leads to reduced neural connectivity and engagement. Even when LLM users later switched to unaided writing, they struggled to accurately quote their own previous work and showed diminished cognitive activity compared to the other groups. The study raises significant concerns about the long-term educational implications of AI reliance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this article is multifaceted, with users expressing a mix of concern, skepticism, and personal anecdote. A primary theme is the long-term impact of AI reliance, particularly on future generations. One commenter likens it to "giving children all the answers without teaching them how to get the answers for themselves," while another speculates on a future "massive talent crunch" in the tech industry as a result of underdeveloped junior developers.

There is also significant skepticism regarding the study's methodology and conclusions. One user dismisses it as a "non-study," arguing the outcome is obvious: a group that doesn't perform a task won't learn from it. Another commenter criticizes the study's validity by pointing out a potential flaw in its design, comparing it to other studies where participants' increased investment in a second test could skew results. A recurring point of contention is the distinction between different uses of AI; several commenters argue that "vibe coding" or passively asking an AI to generate content is fundamentally different from using it as an interactive partner for debugging or comprehension, with the latter potentially preserving or even enhancing learning.

Finally, the discussion touches on the professional implications for developers. One commenter humorously suggests that the "brainrot" from AI might protect older, more traditional developers from being replaced. Another, more seriously, outlines a retirement plan based on the expectation of a future talent shortage, arguing that the inability to train new "pre-AI" computer scientists will drive up the value of existing experienced engineers. The conversation also includes a meta-comment about the irony of using an LLM to summarize an article about the cognitive downsides of using an LLM.

## [Stories removed from the Hacker News Front Page, updated in real time (2024)](https://github.com/vitoplantamura/HackerNewsRemovals)
**Score:** 245 | **Comments:** 177 | **ID:** 46704555

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository titled "HackerNewsRemovals," which provides a real-time, automated log of stories that have been removed from the Hacker News front page. The project aims to offer transparency into the moderation process by tracking which posts are taken down and when.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a community grappling with the nature and effectiveness of HN's moderation. A central theme is the tension between maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio and the perceived censorship of legitimate topics. Many users express fatigue with the constant stream of LLM-related news and politically charged content, supporting the moderation efforts that keep these topics off the front page. They argue that the "silent majority" of users works to keep the site free of ads, political echo chambers, and repetitive discussions.

Conversely, other users argue that this moderation is overly aggressive and stifles important conversations. They contend that in the modern era, technology and politics are inextricably linked, and that discussing the political implications of tech companies and figures (like Musk) is essential. There are concerns that the flagging system is being used to "silence" debates on controversial but relevant subjects, with some users suggesting a pattern where posts critical of right-wing causes are disproportionately targeted. This leads to a debate on whether the issue is biased flagging or simply a community-wide desire to keep the forum focused on pure technology. A few users also point out practical limitations of the tracking tool, noting that many removals are simply duplicates or low-quality posts that are correctly filtered out. Overall, the conversation highlights a fundamental conflict between HN's ideal of being a "hacker's" forum and the reality that its influential platform is a natural venue for broader socio-technical discourse.

## [Nested code fences in Markdown](https://susam.net/nested-code-fences.html)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46705201

> **Article:** The article explains how to nest code fences in Markdown. It clarifies that a code fence is defined by a line starting with at least three backticks (`) or tildes (~), and the block ends with a matching number of the same character. To nest a code block, one simply uses a fence with more backticks (or tildes) than the outer block. For example, a block fenced with four backticks can contain a code snippet fenced with three backticks. This allows for arbitrary levels of nesting by increasing the number of delimiters at each level.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was largely critical of Markdown's design for handling nested code blocks, though some users shared practical workarounds. A recurring theme was the perceived clumsiness of the "counting backticks" method. Several commenters argued that a more robust design would use distinct start and end markers (e.g., `[[[` and `]]]`) to avoid ambiguity and simplify parsing. Others expressed a preference for length-prefixing code blocks, which would entirely avoid delimiter-related issues.

The conversation also broadened to a general critique of Markdown's specification. It was described as a collection of "exceptions and corner cases," with some attributing its success to this ambiguity, which allowed for many "good enough" implementations. The distinction between the original Markdown and the more rigorous CommonMark specification was highlighted.

Practical solutions were also shared:
*   **GitHub Flavored Markdown:** Users noted that GitHub's suggestion feature uses this nesting technique (e.g., ` ````suggestion ... ``` ```` `) and that it's used by tools like JupyterBook.
*   **Alternative Syntaxes:** Commenters mentioned using HTML tags (`<pre>`, `<code>`) as a reliable workaround, or preferring syntaxes like Org-mode (`#+BEGIN_SRC`) which have different, though not necessarily simpler, escaping rules.
*   **LLM Interaction:** One user pointed out the utility of this technique when prompting Large Language Models to generate Markdown within a code block.

## [Ireland wants to give its cops spyware, ability to crack encrypted messages](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/ireland_wants_to_give_police/)
**Score:** 222 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46705715

> **Article:** The article reports that the Irish government is proposing new legislation to grant its police force, the Gardaí, enhanced surveillance powers. Specifically, the proposed laws would allow police to use spyware and other technical methods to intercept and crack encrypted communications. The move is framed as a necessary tool for modern law enforcement to combat serious crime, but it raises significant concerns about privacy and the potential weakening of digital security for all citizens.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the proposed legislation, with commenters expressing fatigue and cynicism towards what they see as a recurring global trend of government overreach into digital privacy. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A central argument is that this is a political and legislative problem, not a solvable technical one. Users point out that even if technologically secure systems are developed, governments can simply compel providers to build backdoors or criminalize the use of such technology, effectively negating cryptographic security.

Many commenters express deep skepticism about the government's motives and competence. They argue that police forces often fail to utilize existing resources effectively to prevent or respond to violent crime, citing examples of institutional negligence in both Romania and the US. This leads to the belief that these new powers are less about public safety and more about mass surveillance and control. The discussion also touches on a perceived global synchronization of these surveillance efforts, with speculation that it's driven by a fear of decentralized technology threatening state power or by shared intelligence briefings about potential future conflicts.

Finally, there is a strong sense of resignation and cynicism, with users comparing Ireland's actions to those of other surveillance-heavy states like the UK and the US. The consensus is that this is part of a long-term "cat and mouse game" between privacy advocates and state actors, but one where the state is increasingly using legal threats to tilt the playing field in its favor.

**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46708032

> **Article:** The article is a test page hosted on a personal website designed to check browser support for the JPEG XL image format. It displays a sample image of the format's creator, Michiel van der Leeuw, and serves as a practical demonstration for users to see if their current browser can render the format natively.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around user experiences with browser compatibility for JPEG XL, revealing a fragmented and inconsistent support landscape. Support appears strongest in WebKit-based browsers like Orion and Epiphany (Gnome Web), as well as in Firefox-based browsers such as Zen and Waterfox. However, users report inconsistent results in Chromium-based browsers like Brave and Chrome, with many noting that the necessary experimental flag is missing even in up-to-date versions. This highlights the format's slow and uneven adoption across major browser engines.

Beyond compatibility, users touch on the format's real-world adoption in industries like photo processing and print shops, which are typically slow to adopt new technologies. There is also a brief discussion on the naming of "JPEG XL," with one user suggesting it fails to convey the "lightweight" or "efficient" qualities that consumers often associate with new formats, though others argue that leveraging the established "JPEG" brand is beneficial. Finally, the conversation briefly touches on the lack of up-to-date WebKit browsers for Android.

## [Swedish Alecta has sold off an estimated $8B of US Treasury Bonds](https://www.di.se/nyheter/di-avslojar-alecta-har-dumpat-amerikanska-statspapper/)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46705256

> **Article:** The article reports that Swedish pension fund Alecta has sold off an estimated $8 billion in US Treasury bonds. The original source is a Swedish financial news outlet, di.se. The post itself provides no additional context or commentary beyond the headline.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the significance of this sale, the broader trend of European funds divesting from US Treasuries, and the potential economic implications. The community's reaction is divided between viewing this as a minor financial event and seeing it as a symbolic or leading indicator of a larger shift.

Key themes include:

*   **Scale and Significance:** Many commenters argue that $8 billion is a negligible amount relative to the multi-trillion-dollar US Treasury market, calling it "symbolic" at best. However, others counter that symbolism matters and that every major trend starts with a small step.
*   **Broader Trend:** The sale is linked to a pattern of European pension funds (notably from Denmark) also selling US Treasuries, with some citing US politics as a reason. This is seen by some as the beginning of a larger de-dollarization trend, while others dismiss it as insignificant noise.
*   **Economic Impact:** A debate emerged on the potential consequences. Some argue that if larger funds like Norway's sovereign wealth fund were to sell, it could cause US interest rates and inflation to spike. Others contend that the current sale's impact is minimal and that other market forces (like Japan's bond issues) are far more influential on yields.
*   **Alternatives to US Markets:** Commenters questioned what Alecta would buy instead. Suggestions included European equities, gold, or other stable assets, but a major point was that Europe lacks a unified bond market as deep and liquid as the US Treasury market, making a full-scale shift difficult.
*   **Market Mechanics:** A few users discussed the basic economics of bond sales, noting that while any sale technically reduces demand, the effect of $8 billion is an "epsilon" (a very small, almost negligible amount). The discussion clarified that a mass sell-off by a major holder would indeed depress prices and raise borrowing costs for the US.

> **Article:** The linked article is the official security.txt file for the cURL project, which is a standard file for disclosing security contact information. The file contains a new, strongly-worded policy statement aimed at curbing low-quality, AI-generated bug reports. It states that the project will "ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports." This is a direct response to cURL being flooded with automated, nonsensical vulnerability reports, which has led the project to announce the removal of its bug bounty program to remove the financial incentive for such submissions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates cURL's frustration, framing the issue as a new and more severe phase of a long-standing problem. The consensus is that AI has dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for generating low-effort, spammy reports, overwhelming maintainers.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **AI as an Accelerant:** Commenters agree that while spammy reports existed before (e.g., during Hacktoberfest), LLMs have made the problem "cheap to generate" at a massive scale, while the human effort required for review remains a bottleneck. The sentiment is that this was an inevitable and predictable outcome of the AI era.
*   **The Problem of Incentives:** The removal of bug bounties is seen as a logical step to remove the financial motivation for "slop" reports. Some noted that monetary compensation might still be worthwhile for high-quality, complete reports that include a patch and test cases, but the current flood of AI-generated noise makes the program unsustainable.
*   **Maintainer Burnout and Practical Solutions:** Several comments highlighted the immense time cost for maintainers, who are often volunteers. One commenter suggested a practical solution used by other projects: requiring all issues and PRs to start in a "discussions" forum, where only maintainers can convert them into formal issues, creating a barrier to low-effort submissions.
*   **Broader Context:** The problem is not limited to cURL. Commenters shared anecdotes from other projects (OWASP, a Kryptos K4 subreddit) and contexts (university coursework, a solo maintainer's experience with Linux distro-specific bugs), suggesting a widespread "bleed-over" of AI misuse into all aspects of work and open-source contribution.
*   **Historical Parallels:** The cURL team's blunt policy was compared to The Pirate Bay's infamous public ridicule of legal threats, with some questioning whether such public shaming is an effective long-term deterrent.

## [Threat actors expand abuse of Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://www.jamf.com/blog/threat-actors-expand-abuse-of-visual-studio-code/)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 154 | **ID:** 46713526

> **Article:** The article from Jamf details how threat actors are increasingly abusing Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for malicious purposes. The primary attack vector involves embedding malicious code within a project's `.vscode` directory, specifically in files like `tasks.json`. When a developer opens a folder in VS Code and grants trust to the repository (a prompt designed to allow extension and command execution), the editor can automatically run these predefined tasks. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the developer's system, potentially leading to malware installation, credential theft, or backdooring the development environment. The article highlights that this method is effective because it leverages a legitimate feature of the editor, making it difficult for users to detect without inspecting configuration files.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the security implications of VS Code's design, the editor's popularity compared to alternatives like Eclipse, and broader concerns about modern development environments.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the security vulnerability itself. Users expressed concern that a text editor could execute hidden code simply by opening a folder, noting that the convenience of "trusted workspaces" comes at the cost of safety. Some debated whether the `tasks.json` file is executed automatically or requires user interaction, but the consensus was that the attack vector is potent because users are conditioned to click "trust" to enable functionality. Comparisons were drawn to historical vulnerabilities in other tools, such as macro-enabled Office documents and execution flaws in Vim, suggesting this is a recurring theme in software security.

There was also a debate regarding VS Code's dominance in the market. One user, coming from an Eclipse background, questioned why VS Code became the de facto standard, suggesting it feels inferior to Eclipse, particularly for Java development. Others countered that VS Code is perceived as "good enough"—extensible and versatile—which outweighs its flaws for most developers. The decline of Eclipse was attributed to the waning popularity of Java in certain sectors rather than the editor's quality itself.

Finally, the discussion expanded to the architecture of modern development tools. Several commenters criticized the trend of building desktop applications using web technologies (Electron), arguing that it creates a massive attack surface and consumes excessive resources. They expressed a preference for JVM-based IDEs like JetBrains products, though it was noted that these tools also execute arbitrary build scripts (e.g., Gradle), which poses similar risks. The conversation concluded with suggestions for better security practices, such as defaulting to containerized development environments to isolate threats, though it was acknowledged that containers do not solve the issue of compromised credentials or infected deployment pipelines.

## [Significant US farm losses persist, despite federal assistance](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/significant-farm-losses-persist-despite-federal-assistance)
**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 218 | **ID:** 46713929

> **Article:** The article from the American Farm Bureau Federation (a pro-farming lobbying group) argues that despite federal assistance programs, US farmers are experiencing significant and persistent financial losses. It likely attributes these losses to a combination of factors including low commodity prices, high input costs (fuel, fertilizer, equipment), and global trade disruptions. The piece serves as an advocacy piece calling for continued or increased government support to sustain the agricultural sector, framing the situation as a crisis that threatens the viability of American farming.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely moves beyond the specific data in the article to debate the fundamental structure of US agriculture, political allegiances, and economic theory.

A dominant theme is the political paradox of the farming vote. Several users express frustration that farmers overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump and the Republican party, despite policies (such as tariffs and trade wars) that directly harmed agricultural exports, particularly soybeans to China. Commenters speculate on why this support persists, with some suggesting a psychological tendency to blame external forces rather than self-reflect, while others note that GOP support remains high among farmers despite economic headwinds.

The conversation also delves into the economic justification for farm subsidies. Users debate whether subsidies are necessary for national security and food stability or if they distort the market. One user pointed to New Zealand’s deregulation of its agricultural sector as a historical example where removing subsidies led to innovation and industry survival, challenging the notion that permanent support is beneficial. Others argued that subsidies are politically motivated—farmers hold disproportionate voting power—and serve to keep consumer food prices stable and predictable.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on corporate consolidation and monopolies. Users argue that farmers are squeezed between powerful monopolies: seed companies (like Bayer/Monsanto), machinery manufacturers (John Deere), and massive food processors (Cargill). In this view, federal subsidies often flow directly to these large corporations rather than helping the farmers themselves. This led to a debate about antitrust enforcement and the role of seed patents in stifling small farmers.

Finally, there is a comparison of the US system to international models, specifically Canada’s "Supply Management" system for dairy. A Canadian user explained that Canada limits production to ensure stable prices and avoid bailouts, contrasting it with the US "free market" approach that results in boom-and-bust cycles requiring massive government intervention. This sparked a counter-debate about the inefficiencies of supply management, such as food waste and high consumer prices.

## [Show HN: Rails UI](https://railsui.com/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46709543

> **Project:** Rails UI is a commercial Ruby gem ($799/year) designed to accelerate front-end development for Ruby on Rails applications. It provides a library of pre-built UI components and page templates built with Tailwind CSS. The project's creator markets it as a tool for solo developers and small startups to rapidly build and prototype applications from scratch (0-1 development), rather than for established teams with existing design systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was mixed, with significant debate over the product's value, design, and pricing. A primary point of contention was the visual quality of the demo site, with some users criticizing the aesthetics as "dated" and arguing that UI frameworks often lower design standards. The high price point ($799/year) was frequently questioned, especially in the context of free alternatives and the rise of AI tools (like Claude or Gemini) that can generate UI code instantly. The creator defended the cost by emphasizing the value of human-coded, production-ready components over AI-generated output that often requires extensive cleanup.

Technical feedback highlighted several bugs, particularly broken functionality and layout issues on mobile Safari, which the developer acknowledged and promised to fix. There was also a broader discussion about the adoption of UI frameworks in corporate environments, where designers and product owners sometimes resist them in favor of custom designs. While some users expressed surprise that Rails still has relevance compared to other frameworks like Django, others shared positive experiences using the tool in the past, noting a lack of Rails-specific UI libraries despite the framework's "batteries-included" philosophy.
