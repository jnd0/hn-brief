**Score:** 696 | **Comments:** 226 | **ID:** 46664755

> **Article:** The article announces the release of jQuery 4.0.0 on the official jQuery blog. While the specific details of the release are not included in the provided text, the discussion indicates it includes migration to ES modules and a "slim" build option. The release marks a major version update for the long-standing JavaScript library.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely nostalgic and pragmatic, celebrating the library's longevity while debating its modern relevance. Key themes include:

**Backwards Compatibility and Accessibility**
Commenters defended jQuery's continued support for Internet Explorer 11, arguing that it is necessary for users in developing regions, school computer labs, and legacy enterprise environments. This was viewed as a commendable commitment to accessibility over obsolescence.

**Size and Performance Comparisons**
A technical debate arose regarding bundle size. While one user noted that jQuery (27 kB) is significantly larger than Preact (4.7 kB), others countered that Preact requires a larger ecosystem of dependencies to be functional. They argued that for lightweight, standalone sites, jQuery remains a highly efficient and self-contained solution.

**Legacy and Career Impact**
Many users expressed gratitude for jQuery, crediting it with making web development enjoyable and accessible during the "jQuery spaghetti code" era. Several developers noted that jQuery (often paired with .NET or WordPress) provided the foundation for their careers and remains a reliable tool for quick scripting without complex build steps.

**Future Outlook**
There was a humorous sentiment that just as jQuery is enduring, React will still be around in 2060, potentially fragmented into multiple versions. However, the general consensus was that while modern frameworks have raised the code quality bar, jQuery remains a valid tool for specific use cases, particularly in legacy codebases or simple user scripts.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 459 | **Comments:** 395 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy, framing it as a likely necessity to monetize free tiers and justify its massive valuation. The author argues that while ads might seem like a sign of slowing innovation or a lack of AGI, they are more likely a business reality to fund the immense compute costs required for scaling. The piece suggests that ads will initially appear in the free version of ChatGPT, potentially as sponsored links or product placements, and draws parallels to how Google integrated ads into its ecosystem without a fully ad-free paid search experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and critical of the prospect of ads in AI, focusing on three main themes: the viability of the ad market for AI, the ethical and user experience implications, and potential counter-movements.

Several users questioned the financial logic, noting that the projected ad revenue might not be sufficient to justify the massive valuations and infrastructure costs, suggesting an "AI bubble." There was a debate on whether ads would be limited to free tiers or inevitably bleed into paid subscriptions, with many expressing strong aversion to being "double-billed" for an ad-free experience.

The ethical implications sparked significant concern. Users worried about the subtle integration of sponsored content into LLM responses, making it difficult to distinguish organic information from advertising—a scenario described as "contaminating" the internet. This led to discussions about the potential for manipulation, given the trust users place in AI outputs.

Finally, the conversation touched on resistance and alternatives. Some commenters advocated for "unplugging" from these ecosystems entirely, while others suggested supporting the development of open-source, locally-run models as a way to maintain an ad-free, privacy-focused alternative to corporate AI.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 427 | **Comments:** 446 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The article is an official joint statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It addresses recent comments by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Greenland. The statement reaffirms the nations' commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, specifically emphasizing the "inviolability of borders" and the "principle of territorial integrity." It explicitly states that they do not support the use of force or coercion to alter international boundaries and underscore the importance of the rule of law and diplomacy in resolving disputes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion regarding the statement is highly polarized and focuses primarily on U.S. domestic politics and the implications of Trump's foreign policy rather than the diplomatic text itself.

A significant portion of the comments expresses alarm and criticism toward the Trump administration. Several users describe the President as a "Mad King" or a "clown," arguing that his threats against a NATO ally are dangerous and disgraceful. There is a strong sentiment of resignation among some American commenters, who feel powerless to stop the administration's actions due to the perceived strength of the federal government and the complicity of the Republican party. Others express shame regarding the U.S. turning on allies like Denmark, who have supported the U.S. in military conflicts.

Conversely, there is a defensive thread arguing that the European Union is weak and that Trump's threats are merely negotiation tactics ("art of the deal") designed to secure better trade or security terms. Some users dismiss the statement as empty bureaucratic posturing, while others argue that the EU will eventually call the U.S.'s bluff.

The discussion also broadens to include historical parallels, with users comparing the U.S. to declining empires like Rome and the UK, and debating whether "hard times" are creating "strong men" or vice versa. Several comments circle back to domestic U.S. controversies, specifically the Epstein files and the 2020 election, suggesting that the Greenland controversy is a distraction from other scandals. Ultimately, the consensus among the majority of commenters is that the relationship between the U.S. and Europe has been permanently damaged.

## [Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video](https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting)
**Score:** 373 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46670024

> **Article:** The article announces the release of A$AP Rocky's music video for "Helicopter," which prominently features Gaussian Splatting, a novel radiance field technique for 3D rendering. Unlike traditional NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) which use implicit neural networks, Gaussian Splatting utilizes an explicit point cloud of 3D ellipsoids (blobs) to represent scenes. This allows for significantly faster rendering and greater flexibility in post-production. The production team captured the performance using a multi-camera array to create a 3D point cloud of the artist. This data was then processed in Houdini using GSOPs (Gaussian Splat Operators) and rendered with OctaneRender, enabling the team to relight the subject and integrate them into surreal environments. The article notes that while the technique requires massive data storage (10TB for 30 minutes of footage), the compositional speed and flexibility make it viable for high-end production.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mix of appreciation for the artistic execution and technical curiosity about the underlying technology. Many commenters were surprised to see a mainstream artist like A$AP Rocky featured on Hacker News, though some noted his history of surreal, tech-forward visuals. The primary technical debate centered on the distinction between Gaussian Splatting and NeRFs. Several users, including one of the creators of the GSOPs tool used in the video, clarified that Gaussian Splatting uses an explicit point cloud representation, whereas NeRFs rely on implicit neural networks. This distinction allows for the faster rendering speeds seen in the video.

Regarding the visual aesthetic, some users felt the result looked like an older version of Unreal Engine or had a "low-fi" quality. However, others argued that this was an intentional artistic choice to lean into the specific artifacts produced by dynamic Gaussian Splatting, such as temporal inconsistencies. There was also a debate over the practicality of the technique; while one user argued that a simple drone shot could achieve similar results cheaper, others countered that the value lies in the post-production flexibility—specifically the ability to relight and reposition the subject in 3D space without reshooting. Finally, the discussion touched on the broader implications for VFX, with users linking to other examples (like the Superman movie breakdown) to illustrate how volumetric capture is changing filmmaking.

## [Erdos 281 solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro](https://twitter.com/neelsomani/status/2012695714187325745)
**Score:** 288 | **Comments:** 271 | **ID:** 46664631

> **Article:** The post links to a tweet claiming that "Erdos 281" was solved using "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro." The specific problem asks whether the natural density of integers not covered by a sequence of arithmetic progressions can be made arbitrarily small. The tweet implies the LLM generated a proof for this problem. The link directs to a social media post rather than a traditional academic paper or preprint.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly pivoted from the initial claim to verification and the broader implications of AI in mathematics. The central point of validation came from a link to the erdosproblems.com forum, where renowned mathematician Terence Tao initially commented that he was impressed by the LLM's ability to avoid common logical pitfalls (such as errors with quantifiers) and placed the result on the wiki as a "Section 1" result.

However, the narrative shifted when a subsequent comment revealed that the problem was actually solved in a 1936 paper by Davenport and Erdős himself. This discovery led to the problem being reclassified from a new result to a known one, though commenters noted that the LLM's proof method was distinct from the literature.

Key themes in the discussion included:
*   **Verification and Authority:** Users were skeptical until Terence Tao endorsed the solution. However, the eventual discovery of prior art highlighted that even expert verification can miss historical context, raising questions about the reliability of LLM "discoveries."
*   **The Nature of Erdős Problems:** Participants noted that the Erdős problem list contains a wide spectrum of difficulty, from "low-hanging fruit" suitable for AI to extremely difficult open problems. This context tempered the excitement, suggesting the LLM solved a problem that was likely under-explored rather than a major unsolved mystery.
*   **AI Capabilities and Coding:** The thread expanded into a debate on AI's role in logic and coding. While some argued that LLMs already surpass humans in specific logic tasks, others countered that they lack the "common sense" required for robust software engineering.
*   **Methodology:** A user noted that DeepSeek also solved the problem, producing a proof that was more comprehensible to a layperson than the GPT-generated version, suggesting different models may approach mathematical reasoning differently.

## [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
**Score:** 282 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46666085

> **Article:** The 2014 article by Adam Drake presents a case study where a simple command-line toolchain (using `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, etc.) processes a 3.46GB dataset of chess games significantly faster (235x) and with less resource usage than a Hadoop cluster running on AWS. The author breaks down the performance bottlenecks of the distributed system—such as cluster startup latency, serialization overhead, and the high cost of moving data—against the efficiency of streaming data through optimized Unix utilities on a single machine. The core argument is that developers should not default to complex distributed systems for problems that can be solved efficiently on a single machine, emphasizing the importance of understanding the problem's scale and the overhead of distributed architectures.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion, largely occurring in the context of the article's frequent reappearances on Hacker News, centers on the evolution of data processing tools and the persistent tendency to over-engineer solutions. A primary theme is the shift from Hadoop to modern, high-performance single-node databases like DuckDB and ClickHouse, which allow massive datasets to be processed on a single, powerful machine, validating the article's original premise. Commenters note that with today's hardware (fast SSDs, abundant RAM), the threshold for needing a distributed cluster is much higher than in 2014.

However, a counterpoint emerges regarding the practicality of shell scripts. While some argue that rewriting inefficient scripts in a compiled language or using modern tools is the right approach, others caution that "robust" bash scripts are rare in practice and can be difficult to maintain. This leads to a broader critique of the modern data stack (e.g., Airflow, Snowflake), with some commenters lamenting that startups often burn significant money on distributed compute for datasets that could easily fit on a single machine, driven by industry trends rather than technical necessity. The conversation concludes with a consensus that while distributed systems have their place for truly massive datasets, the industry has often swung too far towards complexity, and single-node solutions are now more powerful and relevant than ever.

## [The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable)
**Score:** 270 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 46669404

> **Article:** The article is an official press release from the Nobel Peace Prize organization stating that the Nobel Prize and the Laureate are "inseparable." It asserts that the prize is awarded to an individual or organization based on their specific achievements, and that the prestige and identity of the award are intrinsically linked to the recipient. The statement emphasizes that the prize cannot be separated from the laureate, implying that the award's meaning and value are defined by the person or group who receives it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly cynical and satirical, focusing on the perceived absurdity of the Nobel Peace Prize and the immaturity of the political figure at the center of the controversy (implied to be Donald Trump). The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Mockery and Sarcasm:** Many comments use humor to dismiss the situation. Users joke about receiving their own "gold medals" from figures like Usain Bolt or FIFA, highlighting the perceived meaninglessness of the award if it can be so easily claimed or transferred. Others offer sarcastic quips, like suggesting the prize winner can have an old swimming certificate.

*   **Criticism of the Nobel Peace Prize:** A recurring theme is that the Peace Prize is a politicized and meaningless award, distinct from the more merit-based scientific Nobel Prizes. Commenters cite historical controversies, such as awards to Henry Kissinger and Barack Obama, to argue that the prize has long been a "joke" and a tool for political theater rather than a genuine recognition of peace.

*   **Psychological and Political Analysis:** Several commenters focus on the character of the political leader involved, describing him as "thin-skinned," "self-absorbed," and obsessed with recognition. They argue that his behavior is juvenile and that his supporters either see it as entertainment or are drawn to his perceived strength in bending institutions to his will.

*   **Historical and Factual Tangents:** The discussion briefly diverges into related topics, such as the ownership rules for Oscar statues (which are conditional) and the story of James Watson selling his Nobel medal. These serve as analogies or factual footnotes to the main debate about the value and ownership of such prestigious awards.

*   **Debate over the Specific Controversy:** One thread delves into the specific case of a recent laureate (Maria Corina Machado) and the decision to award her the prize. While one user argues it was a "terrible decision" that contributed to conflict, others defend it as a standard choice for an opposition leader, though they acknowledge the subsequent events were "not a great look."

## [A Social Filesystem](https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/)
**Score:** 228 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46665839

> **Article:** The article "A Social Filesystem" by Dan Abramov (overreacted.io) introduces the AT Protocol (Bluesky's underlying technology) by framing it as a "social filesystem." It explains how user data (posts, profiles) is stored in a Personal Data Server (PDS), which functions like a file system where data is organized into repositories and records. The author argues that this architecture decouples data ownership from the application layer, allowing users to host their own data while still participating in a broader, aggregated social network. The article contrasts this with traditional centralized platforms and mentions tools like `pdsls.dev` that allow users to browse their PDS data directly, reinforcing the concept of user agency over their digital footprint.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of enthusiasm for decentralized protocols and skepticism regarding the practical implementation and corporate motivations behind Bluesky's AT Protocol. A central theme is the tension between technical ideals and user accessibility. While the author argues that the protocol empowers users by separating data hosting from the application, critics like `catapart` argue that true decentralization requires hardware solutions that are plug-and-play for non-technical users, suggesting that current iterations still rely on centralized entities like Bluesky PBC for aggregation and monetization.

There is significant debate over the protocol's architecture and comparison to existing standards. Some commenters, like `geokono`, find the design over-engineered, proposing a flatter, hash-based structure similar to SSB or ANProto. The author, `danabramov`, actively engages in the comments to clarify misconceptions—specifically noting that hosting user data is cheap and that the protocol is designed to handle public data aggregation first, distinguishing it from projects like Solid or remoteStorage which focus more on private data.

The discussion also touches on the practical realities of data ownership. Commenters highlight that while users can host their own PDS, the public nature of the data means deletion is difficult and privacy relies on operational security rather than protocol enforcement. Overall, the community views the article as a solid introduction to the AT Protocol, though opinions on its viability and "architecture astronaut" tendencies remain divided.

**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46665310

> **Article:** The article is a design retrospective of the ThinkPad laptop line, hosted on ThinkNextDesign.com. It explores the history and evolution of the ThinkPad's iconic design language, likely featuring insights from its designers and showcasing various models over the years.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly nostalgic, with users expressing deep affection for the ThinkPad brand, particularly older models. The conversation centers on several key themes:

**Durability and Longevity:** Many commenters praise the extreme durability and longevity of ThinkPads, sharing anecdotes of devices lasting 8+ years and being used as servers. The T-series is frequently cited as a reliable workhorse.

**Design Philosophy:** There is a strong consensus that the classic ThinkPad design—its black, boxy aesthetic, and especially the keyboard—is timeless and should not be changed. Users are explicitly against "upgrading" to a metal chassis, valuing the current plastic/magnesium composite for its practicality and distinct identity.

**Modern Criticisms and Issues:** Despite the brand loyalty, users report significant issues with modern Lenovo models. Common complaints include:
*   **Linux Compatibility:** Persistent problems with sleep mode, which can brick the device or break Wi-Fi functionality.
*   **Performance and Thermals:** Some modern models (like the X1) are criticized for weak CPUs and poor thermal management.
*   **Corporate Decline:** A recurring sentiment is that Lenovo is "riding the brand to destruction," citing poor customer service, quality control issues (dead batteries, bricked devices), and a general decline in goodwill.

**Practical Considerations:** The discussion also touches on practicalities like screen size (some prefer larger than 14 inches) and the best way to acquire a good machine today—many recommend buying 2-3 year old used or "new old stock" (NOS) units for value.

## [Flux 2 Klein pure C inference](https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46670279

> **Article:** Salvatore "antirez" Sanfilippo (creator of Redis) has released "Flux 2 Klein," a pure C implementation of the inference pipeline for the Flux.2 AI image generation model. The project was developed using Anthropic's Opus LLM to transpile the model's reference Python implementation into C, with the goal of creating a lightweight, dependency-free alternative to the heavy Python-based AI stack. The repository includes the C source code, benchmarks, and implementation notes detailing the AI-assisted development process.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the implications of AI-assisted code generation, the technical merits of the project, and licensing concerns. Commenters were largely impressed by the project but expressed caution about the reliability and quality of AI-generated code.

Key themes included:
*   **AI-Assisted Development Process:** The author detailed his workflow, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a constantly updated "IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md" file to provide the LLM with persistent context and prevent it from losing track of the project's goals. This "vibe-speccing" approach was highlighted as crucial for managing complex coding tasks.
*   **Code Quality and Reliability:** A major point of debate was the production-readiness of AI-generated code. While some argued that modern LLMs like Opus 4.5 can produce high-quality, idiomatic code, others remained skeptical, noting that LLMs often introduce subtle logic errors. A common suggestion was to use a second, separate LLM instance to audit the code generated by the first, acting as an automated peer reviewer.
*   **Performance and Practicality:** Users questioned the performance benefits, with the author and others clarifying that the C implementation is currently slower than optimized Python libraries (which are themselves C/C++ under the hood). The primary value is seen in portability and reducing dependency overhead, not raw speed at this stage.
*   **Licensing and Ethics:** A minor but notable discussion point was the project's MIT license, which differs from the original Flux model's Apache license. Commenters questioned whether it was appropriate to re-license the AI-generated code, but the author defended it by stating his implementation was a from-scratch re-implementation of the inference logic, not a direct copy of the reference code.
*   **Broader Context:** The project was seen as part of a larger trend of using AI to port software between languages. An anecdote was shared about a similar AI-generated port to `llama.cpp` being rejected by maintainers for quality reasons, which some saw as a temporary hurdle that would soon be overcome as AI coding capabilities improve.

## [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 93 | **ID:** 46666283

> **Article:** The article links to "Consent-O-Matic," a browser extension designed to automate the process of rejecting non-essential cookies on websites. It works by programmatically navigating the complex menus of cookie consent pop-ups to select "Reject All" or equivalent options, rather than simply hiding the banners or accepting all tracking.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a fragmented landscape of user strategies for handling intrusive cookie banners, with "Consent-O-Matic" serving as a focal point for debate. The primary divide is between users who prioritize convenience and those who prioritize granular privacy control.

Many users champion "Consent-O-Matic" for its specific function of automating the "reject all" flow, viewing it as a significant quality-of-life improvement that prevents browsing interruptions. However, others report inconsistent performance, noting that the extension sometimes fails to dismiss pop-ups or breaks website functionality.

A major alternative discussed is uBlock Origin's "cookie notices" list, which is praised for its simplicity and cross-platform availability. However, critics warn that this method can be a blunt instrument, potentially breaking sites and lacking the nuanced choice offered by dedicated extensions. The "I don't care about cookies" extension is also mentioned but faces criticism for potentially defaulting to accepting tracking to ensure site functionality, a concern that extends to browser fingerprinting.

Underlying the technical solutions is a broader frustration with the state of online consent. Several commenters argue that the proliferation of these banners is a form of "civil disobedience" by companies to annoy users into blaming the EU, noting that many sites don't legally require such prompts. This has led to a "cargo cult" situation where banners are ubiquitous even when unnecessary, rendering the concept of meaningful consent almost meaningless as users simply click to dismiss the annoyance.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-2403016)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46669945

> **Article:** The article is a joint statement from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. It addresses the situation in Greenland, implicitly responding to recent US political rhetoric regarding territorial control. The statement reaffirms the European nations' commitment to NATO, international law, and the sovereignty of Greenland within the Kingdom of Denmark. It emphasizes the importance of transatlantic security and rejects the use of force or economic coercion to alter international boundaries.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the geopolitical implications of the US administration's stance on Greenland, ranging from diplomatic analysis to speculative military scenarios.

A significant portion of the comments focuses on the perceived inadequacy of European defense capabilities. Several users argue that Europe lacks the military credibility to defend Greenland or deter US aggression, viewing the statement as a diplomatic formality with little practical weight. One commenter suggested that the status quo might lead to an independent Greenland vulnerable to adversaries, while another criticized European nations for historically underfunding NATO and relying too heavily on US security guarantees.

Conversely, other users discussed potential US domestic responses to any aggressive action. Commenters expressed pessimism about the US Congress acting as a check on executive power, noting that the current political climate makes legislative intervention unlikely. There was also speculation regarding the logistics of a potential US military operation, with users debating whether special operations forces would be sufficient or if a larger invasion force would be required, potentially facing internal resistance within the US military.

The discussion also touched on economic factors, with one user defending US trade grievances—specifically regarding EU tariffs and VAT on American goods like Harley-Davidson motorcycles—arguing that these practices justify a tougher US trade stance. However, another user countered that such disputes should be handled through established WTO mechanisms rather than unilateral threats. The tone of the discussion varied from serious geopolitical analysis to alarmist predictions, including a fringe theory linking the Greenland issue to a potential conflict with Canada.

**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46664638

> **Article:** The article is a Wikipedia page detailing the longest word in the Greek language, "Lopado­temacho­selacho­galeo­kranio­leipsano­drim­hypo­trimmato­silphio­karabo­melito­katakechy­meno­kichl­epi­kossypho­phatto­perister­alektryon­opte­kephallio­kigklo­peleio­lagoio­siraio­baphe­tragano­pterygon." This compound word, which translates to a list of various foods including "a sauce of fish and other ingredients," appears in Aristophanes' comedy *Assemblywomen*. It is cited as the longest word to appear in literature, comprising 78 letters (or 83 with diacritics).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the technical side effects of posting such a long word on Hacker News. Several users noted that the unbroken string of characters broke the layout of the mobile site, causing horizontal scrolling and layout overflow. This sparked a brief meta-conversation about mobile clients and the psychology of assuming technical glitches are the user's fault rather than the site's.

Beyond the layout issues, the conversation evolved into a comparison of other long words. Users referenced famous English examples like "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" and "antidisestablishmentarianism," as well as the playful "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious." There was also a mention of long place names and a humorous exchange using pseudo-archaic vocabulary. A few users made jokes about the word itself, with one speculating it was a new drug name and another expressing a desire to taste the dish it describes.

## [Profession by Isaac Asimov (1957)](https://www.abelard.org/asimov.php)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46664195

> **Article:** The article is a link to Isaac Asimov's 1957 science fiction short story, "Profession." The story is set in a future society where individuals are specialized for careers from birth via "taping," a process that imprints knowledge directly onto the brain. The protagonist, George, is an "anomaly" who rejects his assigned profession and seeks to learn through traditional study. The narrative explores the limitations of rote knowledge versus genuine understanding and creativity, culminating in a twist where George discovers that the "taping" process is actually a method to identify individuals capable of true, original thought—those who are "unteachable" by the system are the ones destined to be the innovators and leaders of society.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the story's enduring relevance, particularly regarding education, creativity, and the rise of artificial intelligence. Many commenters praised the story as one of Asimov's finest, highlighting its powerful ending and its critique of rigid, specialized systems. A dominant theme was the parallel between the story's "taped" humans and modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Users expressed concern that reliance on AI for knowledge and problem-solving mirrors the story's society, potentially stifling deep learning and critical thinking. There was a shared fear that this could create a population of "users" who can execute tasks but lack the ability to innovate or understand underlying principles.

Another key thread focused on the story's commentary on education and innovation. Several users connected the narrative to real-world issues, such as how formal education systems can inhibit creativity and how true breakthroughs often come from outsiders or those on the fringes. The story was also seen as a metaphor for the "Mozart effect" debate and the nature of expertise, with commenters discussing the difference between memorized knowledge and genuine mastery. While the conversation was largely philosophical, a minor point of caution was raised about the source website's content, but this was quickly addressed by others providing alternative, cleaner links to the story.

## [What is Plan 9?](https://fqa.9front.org/fqa0.html#0.1)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46667675

> **Article:** The linked article is the "Frequently Questioned Answers" (FQA) for Plan 9, a distributed operating system developed at Bell Labs by the creators of Unix. It serves as an FAQ-style introduction and defense of Plan 9's design philosophy, which extends the "everything is a file" concept to create a unified, network-transparent system. The document explains core Plan 9 concepts like namespaces, the per-process environment, and the use of the 9P protocol for resource sharing, positioning the OS as a coherent alternative to the complexities of modern Unix-like systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community with a deep appreciation for Plan 9's design principles, even while acknowledging its niche status. A recurring theme is the influence of Plan 9's ideas on mainstream technology. Commenters point out that the 9P network protocol, a core component of Plan 9, is used in practical applications like the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to share filesystems between host and guest, and that Linux's native v9fs driver is a direct descendant. This highlights how Plan 9's concepts have permeated modern systems, even if the OS itself remains obscure.

The conversation also touches on the tension between Plan 9's minimalist philosophy and modern software development trends. One user expresses a preference for the simplicity of Plan 9's C dialect over the complexity of languages like C++ or Swift, viewing it as a form of "therapy." However, another commenter counters that the "everything is a file" abstraction may be less relevant in an era dominated by web APIs and SQL databases, suggesting that OS research might be more impactful at the application level. The discussion around language support is nuanced; while one user wishes for Rust on Plan 9, another argues that its C-based toolchain is a good fit for a research OS and points to a separate "R9" project that reimplements the Plan 9 kernel in Rust.

Finally, the community's active engagement is evident. Users share resources for running Plan 9 on modern hardware (like a Retina-capable drawterm for Macs), discuss its status as a "stepping stone" between Unix and Inferno, and note the ongoing development of forks like 9front. Practical limitations are also acknowledged, such as the lack of a modern browser and video acceleration, which prevent it from being a daily-driver desktop OS for many enthusiasts. The conversation concludes with a philosophical debate on the elegance of filesystem-based networking (as in Plan 9) versus the more common BSD socket interface.

## [Police Invested Millions in Shadowy Phone-Tracking Software Won't Say How Used](https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-police-invest-tangles-sheriff-surveillance/)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46672150

> **Article:** The Texas Observer article investigates the significant financial investment by Texas law enforcement agencies, particularly the Harris County Sheriff's Office, in a secretive phone-tracking software called "Tangles." The software, developed by a company called Nebulus, is capable of extracting and analyzing vast amounts of data from mobile phones without needing to bypass security locks. The investigation reveals that these agencies have spent millions of dollars on the tool but are largely unwilling to disclose how, when, or in what types of investigations it is being used, citing concerns about compromising its effectiveness. This lack of transparency raises serious questions about potential violations of privacy rights and the Fourth Amendment, as the software's capabilities could enable warrantless mass surveillance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the police's use of this software and the lack of transparency surrounding it. A primary theme is the concern over constitutional rights and privacy. One commenter suggests this practice is a form of "parallel construction," where evidence obtained through questionable means is hidden. Another sarcastically notes the argument that the Constitution is a static document, implying that modern surveillance tactics are stretching its original intent. Commenters express alarm at a police official's admission that the software is used to find "avenues for obtaining probable cause," viewing this as a fundamental violation of rights where surveillance precedes justification.

Another major theme is the perceived futility of protest and the rise of a surveillance state. One commenter laments that despite online outrage over such stories, tangible change never seems to occur. Another paints a dystopian picture of the wealthy using technology to achieve "omnipotence" and make dissent impossible, expressing little hope that the general population will develop the "class consciousness" needed to resist. Finally, there is a cynical consensus that data privacy is an illusion, with one user connecting the software's data sources to the ubiquitous and often deceptive cookie consent notices found across the internet, suggesting that user data inevitably ends up in government hands regardless of stated privacy choices.

## [A free and open-source rootkit for Linux](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1053099/19c2e8180aeb0438/)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46666288

> **Article:** The article from LWN.net introduces Singularity, a new, modern, and open-source rootkit for the Linux kernel. It details the technical mechanisms the rootkit uses to achieve its goals, such as hooking kernel functions via Ftrace to hide processes and files, disable security features, and enable remote code execution. The article positions the tool as a resource for security researchers and educators, while also acknowledging its potential for misuse. It highlights the rootkit's ability to persistently re-enable Ftrace if an administrator attempts to disable it at runtime.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion围绕 the release of an open-source Linux rootkit centered on several key themes. A prominent thread humorously debated the licensing implications, with one user lamenting that the MIT license doesn't force criminals to share their modified source code, unlike the GPL. Others joked that criminals would likely ignore copyright law altogether.

Technically, the conversation explored the rootkit's methods, particularly its use of Ftrace. One user inquired if it's possible to compile a kernel with Ftrace support completely removed to mitigate such attacks, with others confirming this is feasible.

The discussion also branched into related practical applications. One user mentioned they were developing a derivative to hook the Virtual File System (VFS) for per-process file path remapping, a plan that was met with skepticism. Other commenters suggested simpler, existing solutions like using mount namespaces or `LD_PRELOAD` instead of resorting to complex and risky kernel modifications.

Finally, the community debated the ethics and wisdom of releasing such tools publicly. While some expressed concern about empowering malicious actors, the prevailing sentiment was that open-source rootkits have existed for a long time. The consensus was that this project is more beneficial for security researchers and defenders learning about kernel internals and attack techniques than it is a novel threat.

## [Software engineers can no longer neglect their soft skills](https://www.qu8n.com/posts/most-important-software-engineering-skill-2026)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 184 | **ID:** 46667572

> **Article:** The article argues that "soft skills" (communication, collaboration, business impact) are becoming the most critical skill for software engineers by 2026. It posits that as AI automates routine coding tasks, the value of human engineers will shift toward their ability to navigate organizational complexity, align with business goals, and communicate effectively. The author suggests that technical prowess alone is no longer sufficient for career longevity, and engineers must proactively develop these non-technical abilities to remain relevant.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a complex and often skeptical reaction to the article's thesis, centering on several key themes.

Many commenters debate the premise that soft skills are a new requirement. Several argue that these skills have always been essential for career advancement, suggesting the article is merely highlighting a long-standing reality rather than a future shift. However, a counterpoint emerges that while soft skills were once a "tarpit" slowing career growth, they are now becoming a baseline requirement for employment itself, as AI reduces the need for pure code production.

The conversation frequently pivots to the role of AI in education and the workforce. A notable sub-thread discusses how university students are using generative AI, with mentors distinguishing between those using it as a learning tool and those using it as a crutch, leading to an inability to explain their own solutions. This connects to a broader anxiety about the future of work, with some commenters expressing concern that the profession is becoming less accessible to neurodiverse individuals or those who found refuge in its technical focus, while others see AI as a necessary filter to remove unqualified practitioners.

Skepticism is also directed at the "soft skills" industry itself. Some engineers express a distrust of business and management jargon, fearing it can obscure technical reality and lead to ineffective decision-making. This is contrasted with the view that effective communication is a fundamental human skill, not just a corporate tool.

Finally, the discussion is punctuated by broader socio-economic critiques. One prominent commenter uses the topic to launch into a systemic critique of corporate responsibility, arguing that focusing on individual adaptation (like learning soft skills) is a distraction from larger, collective problems like climate change and ecological collapse, ultimately advocating for Universal Basic Income (UBI) as an inevitable solution to technological displacement.

## [Prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes about gambling](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/america-is-slow-walking-into-a-polymarket-disaster/ar-AA1Upfdb)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46670524

> **Article:** The article argues that the mainstreaming of prediction markets like Polymarket represents a dangerous "slow walk" toward a world where news becomes indistinguishable from gambling. It posits that these platforms are highly susceptible to manipulation by wealthy actors who can afford to place large bets to influence public perception and media narratives. The author contends that unlike traditional polling, which is expensive to rig, prediction markets offer a cheap and direct way to sway sentiment by moving odds, effectively turning news into a gambling-driven spectacle with potentially destabilizing societal consequences.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide between those who see prediction markets as a useful informational tool and those who view them as a corrupting, manipulative force. A central theme is the debate over the integrity and utility of these platforms. Proponents argue that prediction markets often provide more accurate insights than polls and offer genuine predictive value. However, critics counter that this accuracy is fragile; once these markets become widely cited in the news, they cease to be passive indicators and become targets for manipulation. The argument is that it becomes far cheaper to manipulate a thinly traded market to generate favorable headlines than to conduct a broad persuasion campaign, a point underscored by Goodhart's Law ("When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure").

Another prominent thread is the comparison of prediction markets to other forms of gambling and speculation. Some commenters dismiss the concern, equating Polymarket to NFTs or options trading, suggesting that uninformed participants will simply lose their money. Others, however, argue that the accessibility and simplicity of event-based betting make these platforms uniquely attractive and dangerous for a broad, financially naive audience.

Finally, the discussion broadens into a philosophical critique of modern society. One user invoked historical parallels to France's monetary debasement, framing the rise of gambling as a symptom of societal decay and a loss of faith in productive enterprise. Another commenter introduced Chesterton's Fence, suggesting that the long-standing societal taboos against gambling exist for a reason and that dismantling them without understanding the underlying logic is reckless. The overall sentiment leans skeptical, with many users expressing concern that these platforms are less about genuine prediction and more about creating new, easily exploitable "rackets" for the wealthy and influential.
