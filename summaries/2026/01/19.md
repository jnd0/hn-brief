## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 663 | **Comments:** 643 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs. It concludes that, contrary to claims that exporting countries pay the tariffs, the costs are overwhelmingly borne by American importers and consumers. The analysis cites evidence from past tariff shocks (e.g., on Brazil and India) where export prices did not fall, but trade volumes collapsed instead. The article frames the policy as economically detrimental to the U.S., resulting in higher prices and disrupted supply chains without achieving its stated goals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the tariffs and largely agrees with the article's economic analysis, though it branches into political and legal speculation. The conversation can be grouped into several key themes:

**Economic Consensus and Mechanisms:**
There is a strong consensus among commenters that tariffs function as a tax on the domestic consumer, a concept described as "Economics 101." Users explain that the cost is absorbed by the importer and passed on to the consumer, or that trade volumes collapse if the price increase is not viable. Some debate the nuances of price elasticity and supply chains, noting that even domestic goods often rely on imported inputs, making true substitution difficult.

**Political and Legal Ramifications:**
The discussion quickly turns to the political context, with commenters linking the tariffs to the Trump administration. A significant thread speculates on the legal authority to impose tariffs, with one user raising the possibility of the Supreme Court ruling them an illegal tax. This leads to further speculation about the administration potentially attempting to replace Supreme Court justices if the ruling goes against them. The conversation also touches on the political motivations, with some suggesting the policy serves foreign interests (specifically Russia) or is driven by a misguided mercantilist ideology.

**Skepticism and Counterarguments:**
While the dominant view is that consumers bear the cost, a few users offered counterpoints. One suggested that Chinese exporters might be absorbing some of the cost by lowering prices for other markets, though another user countered this by pointing to China's stable Producer Price Index. There is also a meta-discussion about the source of the analysis (a German think tank), with some users expressing skepticism about foreign institutions commenting on U.S. policy, while others defended the credibility of economic data regardless of its origin.

## [A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth](https://bitchat.free/)
**Score:** 541 | **Comments:** 300 | **ID:** 46675853

> **Article:** The article links to "Bitchat," a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth. The service aims to provide a communication channel that does not rely on internet connectivity or central servers, functioning directly between nearby devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Bitchat is largely skeptical and comparative, focusing on its practical utility, security, and the identity of its creator.

A significant portion of the comments centers on the app's creator, Jack Dorsey (co-founder of Twitter). Several users express distrust or dislike toward Dorsey, citing his involvement as a negative factor. This sentiment leads many to recommend Briar, an established open-source alternative that offers similar offline messaging capabilities via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but is viewed as more trustworthy and feature-complete.

The practical use cases for Bluetooth-only messaging were debated. While some users struggled to identify scenarios where such limited range (typically under 400 meters) is useful, others pointed to specific situations like large festivals with overloaded cellular networks, protests, or areas with poor internet coverage. However, technical limitations were highlighted as a major hurdle. Users noted that iOS aggressively kills background apps, which would disrupt the "always-on" nature required for mesh networking. Additionally, a lack of "store-and-forward" capabilities—where devices cache messages to relay to future peers—was identified as a critical missing feature for real-world usability.

Security concerns were also raised. While the app is positioned as a tool for privacy, some commenters noted that Bitchat has not undergone the rigorous security audits that Briar has, making them hesitant to rely on it for sensitive activities like protesting.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader themes of digital autonomy. Users expressed a desire for a "everyday" P2P network that is harder to monitor and censor, with some mentioning Meshtastic as a way to extend the range of such Bluetooth-based networks. There was also a tangential but popular discussion about the financial feasibility of achieving "fuck-you money" to opt out of the traditional internet ecosystem, sparked by Dorsey's involvement.

## [Radboud University selects Fairphone as standard smartphone for employees](https://www.ru.nl/en/staff/news/radboud-university-selects-fairphone-as-standard-smartphone-for-employees)
**Score:** 480 | **Comments:** 228 | **ID:** 46676276

> **Article:** Radboud University in the Netherlands has selected Fairphone as its standard smartphone for employees. The university's announcement highlights the benefits of this choice, focusing on the device's modularity and repairability. By choosing a phone with easily replaceable parts, the university's IT service desk can perform repairs in-house, such as swapping out batteries or screens, rather than sending devices away for service. This approach is intended to extend the lifespan of the devices, reduce electronic waste, and potentially lower long-term costs associated with maintenance and procurement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's discussion centered on the practical, economic, and philosophical implications of the university's decision. A key theme was the viability of in-house repair. Several commenters, including those with experience in corporate IT, affirmed that servicing devices internally is a common and cost-effective practice, especially at scale. They argued that for an organization like a university with an existing IT department, stocking spare parts for a modular phone like the Fairphone is more efficient than managing external repair contracts or reimbursements.

The conversation also explored the broader context of sustainable technology. While the Fairphone was praised for its repairability, some users expressed skepticism based on personal experiences with reliability or the company's long-term product support, noting that models can be discontinued. This led to a debate on whether buying second-hand phones is a more sustainable option. The discussion frequently touched upon the limitations of the Fairphone and the market's failure to produce more desirable sustainable devices. Commenters lamented the lack of features like optical zoom cameras, USB 3.0/DisplayPort support, and smaller form factors, suggesting that the "right to repair" movement needs to be supplemented with legislation mandating replaceable batteries and screens across all manufacturers. Finally, a tangential but notable thread emerged from users seeking a device free from the Apple/Google duopoly, with suggestions ranging from installing alternative operating systems like /e/OS or Sailfish OS to using Linux-based tablets.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 437 | **Comments:** 242 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** Amazon will end its inventory commingling program for third-party sellers on March 31, 2026. Commingling allowed multiple sellers to pool identical items in Amazon's fulfillment centers, meaning a customer buying from a specific seller could receive a product shipped from another seller's inventory. The change means that when a customer buys from a specific vendor, they will receive the exact item sourced from that vendor, eliminating the risk of receiving counterfeit or inferior goods from a different provider pooled under the same SKU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the announcement, viewing it as a long-overdue correction to a system that prioritized logistics efficiency over product authenticity. Many users shared personal experiences of receiving counterfeit or defective goods—such as HDMI adapters and toner cartridges—despite purchasing from reputable sellers, confirming that commingling facilitated fraud and eroded trust in the platform.

Commenters debated the motivations behind the timing of the decision. While some speculated that Amazon finally acknowledged the reputational damage outweighed the logistical benefits, others suggested the move was driven by financial pressure, such as penalties from manufacturers or large buyers who were burned by counterfeit inventory. Several users expressed skepticism that this change alone would restore their trust, noting that Amazon's reputation had already declined significantly over the years due to these issues.

The discussion also touched on broader themes regarding Amazon's market power. Some users suggested bypassing Amazon entirely by purchasing directly from manufacturer websites to ensure authenticity. Additionally, a tangent emerged comparing Amazon's commingling to the historical Kenyan coffee trade, where beans from different farmers were pooled, allegedly discouraging quality improvement and fair compensation for growers.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 343 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is the full text of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his nonviolent protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter is a defense of direct action against racial injustice. King argues that individuals have a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws, defining an unjust law as one that degrades human personality and is not rooted in eternal or natural law. He distinguishes between just and unjust laws, stating that a law is unjust when it is applied unequally to deny citizens their rights. King expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate," whom he identifies as a greater obstacle to freedom than overt segregationists due to their devotion to order over justice and their preference for a "negative peace" (absence of tension) over a "positive peace" (presence of justice). He refutes the idea of waiting for a "more convenient season" for freedom and explains the purpose of nonviolent direct action is to create a crisis that forces a community to confront an issue it has consistently ignored.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the enduring relevance of King's letter, with users highlighting its philosophical depth and its application to contemporary political and social issues. Key themes include:

*   **Philosophical Foundations of Civil Disobedience:** Several commenters point to King's nuanced argument that breaking an unjust law, while accepting the penalty, is a form of respect for a higher, just law. This is linked to the broader concept of civil disobedience, tracing its roots to Thoreau and the American founding principles that distinguish between legality and justice. The distinction between a law that is "just on its face" but "unjust in its application" was a particular point of focus.

*   **The "White Moderate" as a Modern Archetype:** A prominent theme is the application of King's critique of the "white moderate" to current politics. One commenter explicitly maps this archetype onto the modern Democratic Party, arguing that its leadership prioritizes order, incrementalism, and donor interests over substantive justice, thereby frustrating the party's progressive base. This is contrasted with a more confrontational, "leftist" approach that demands systemic change rather than reform. The murder of Reyes Good and the legislative response (e.g., body cameras for ICE) is cited as a modern example of this moderate failure.

*   **Historical Context and Non-Violence:** A counter-narrative challenges the sanitized, mainstream portrayal of King's non-violence. One commenter argues that the success of the Civil Rights Movement was not solely due to King's oratory but was also a product of the real and credible threat of violence from armed groups like the Black Panthers. In this view, King's "carrot" of nonviolent protest was effective precisely because of the "stick" of potential unrest, a dynamic often omitted from school curricula.

*   **Personal Impact and Timeless Wisdom:** Many users share personal reflections on the letter's profound impact, describing it as a "masterclass" in influence and a text they return to annually. They highlight specific passages on the nature of time (that it is neutral and can be used constructively or destructively), the futility of violence in curing hate, and the concept of true forgiveness as a "fresh start" independent of past transgressions.

*   **Contemporary Political Commentary:** The discussion extends beyond the Democratic Party to include broader political trends. One commenter expresses alarm at the growing mainstream acceptance of repealing civil rights legislation and the 19th amendment, viewing it as a significant regression. Another commenter engages in a debate about the electoral viability of progressive ideas, suggesting that persistent electoral losses for certain platforms may indicate a lack of broad public support rather than a failure of the party establishment.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 305 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-weight large language model from the Z.ai team. It is a 31B parameter model (likely a Mixture-of-Experts with 3.9B active parameters) designed to offer high performance in a smaller, more efficient footprint suitable for local deployment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the release of GLM-4.7-Flash with a mix of technical curiosity, practical deployment advice, and benchmark comparisons. The discussion centered on the model's viability as a local, self-hosted alternative to proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini.

Key themes included:
*   **Performance and Benchmarks:** Users compared the model's reported scores against competitors. While some noted that open models still lag behind top proprietary ones by roughly a year, others found the coding performance (specifically on SWE-Bench) impressive for a 31B model, suggesting it could rival GPT-5 mini or o3 in quality. However, skepticism remained regarding "benchmaxxing," with users noting that smaller models often hallucinate on complex tasks despite decent scores.
*   **Local Deployment and Hardware:** A major focus was the feasibility of running the model locally. With a 4-bit quantization, the model fits comfortably on consumer hardware (e.g., 32GB RAM/MacBooks or RTX 3090s), making it attractive for fine-tuning experiments and local coding assistance. Users quickly shared links to GGUF quantizations and provided `llama.cpp` commands for setup.
*   **API and Cloud Availability:** Users inquired about immediate cloud access. While providers like Novita and z.ai were mentioned, the consensus was that integration takes time. A user shared a negative experience with Cerebras' API for the non-Flash version, citing aggressive rate limits and poor caching economics that made it expensive and impractical despite high theoretical speeds.
*   **Model Architecture and Size:** Confusion existed regarding the model's size, with some initially mistaking it for a massive 355B parameter model. It was clarified that the "Flash" variant is the 31B version, distinct from the larger GLM-4.7. Users also noted the model's size in GB (62GB vs. GPT-OSS 20B's 11GB), indicating it is closer in capacity to larger 120B models.
*   **Practical Use Cases:** Developers expressed a need for capable small models (8B–30B range) for specific tasks like writing tests and translation, where waiting for larger models like Codex or Opus is inefficient. The release was viewed as a solid incremental improvement that lowers the barrier to entry for high-quality local AI.

## [Show HN: I quit coding years ago. AI brought me back](https://calquio.com/finance/compound-interest)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 410 | **ID:** 46673809

> **Project:** The project is a web-based financial calculator for compound interest, built by a developer who returned to coding after years away, using AI to accelerate the process. The stack includes Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui, with the AI selecting these tools based on a "modern and clean" prompt. The site supports multiple languages (EN, DE, FR, JA) and includes a "knowledge base" section explaining compound interest concepts.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on AI's role in lowering barriers to coding and prototyping, with many users sharing personal experiences of how AI tools have re-enabled them to build projects despite time constraints or being out of practice. Key themes include: AI as an "end-user programming" wave (like Excel formulas), enabling rapid ideation and prototyping without setup overhead, and its impact on productivity for professionals like researchers and farmers. However, criticism emerged around the project's quality, particularly the AI-generated "knowledge base" content being labeled as "slop," and concerns about AI-generated websites becoming commonplace. Some debated the cost-effectiveness of premium AI models versus cheaper alternatives like Copilot, while others offered constructive suggestions for improving navigation (e.g., adding search). Overall, the sentiment was mixed—celebrating AI's democratizing potential but cautioning against low-quality, unedited AI output.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 144 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that Big Tech lobbying has significantly influenced the European Union to weaken digital rights legislation. It details how major US tech companies have systematically lobbied against regulations like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and AI Act, framing them as burdens to innovation and competitiveness. The author claims this corporate pressure, often backed by US diplomatic channels, has led to a "roll-back" of citizen protections in favor of US corporate interests, undermining the EU's original regulatory ambitions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the EU's regulatory stance, though opinions diverge on the causes and solutions. A dominant theme is the perceived failure of EU leadership, with many commenters accusing the Commission of corruption and subservience to US corporate interests. Several users express a lack of faith in political processes, arguing that politicians are too removed from voters to be held accountable and that public outrage rarely leads to policy change.

Geopolitics, particularly the Trump administration's policies, is viewed as a double-edged sword. Some hope that US antagonism (e.g., threats to Greenland, tariffs) will force the EU to assert digital sovereignty and abandon reliance on American tech. However, others fear this instability will only worsen the situation or lead to conflict.

There is a significant debate regarding the economic impact of EU regulations. While the article frames the roll-back as a rights violation, some commenters argue that strict regulations stifle European competitiveness and drive companies away, validating the tech industry's lobbying efforts.

Finally, a recurring sentiment is that digital rights are a low priority for the average European citizen. Several users note the absence of widespread public protests or awareness regarding US tech dominance, suggesting that the concerns raised in the article are confined to a small, niche minority.

## [High-speed train collision in Spain kills at least 39](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedw6ylpynyo)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 231 | **ID:** 46673453

> **Article:** The BBC article reports on a high-speed train collision in Spain that killed at least 39 people. The train involved was a Frecciarossa 1000, an Italian-designed model. Initial reports indicate the train derailed, though the specific cause of the crash is not yet determined. Spanish officials have noted that the track where the accident occurred had been renewed recently, and the train itself had been inspected just days prior to the incident.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the tragedy quickly evolved into three distinct areas of conversation: safety analysis, technical and historical context, and political speculation.

Many commenters debated the statistical safety of rail travel compared to automobiles. Several users noted that while the crash was horrific, train travel remains significantly safer than driving, with one user pointing out that road deaths in Spain occur at a rate of roughly five per day, making this rail accident a statistical outlier. Others discussed personal safety measures, such as sitting with one's back to the direction of travel, though this was debated as being more relevant for trains without seatbelts.

Technically, users identified the train model and discussed the manufacturer's history, referencing a 2020 derailment of the same model and the manufacturer's troubled history with the Fyra trains in the Netherlands. There was also a shared interest in railway safety systems, with users recommending YouTube channels dedicated to crash analysis and discussing the history of semaphore signaling.

Finally, a significant portion of the debate focused on Spanish infrastructure and politics. Some users speculated that the accident might be used as political leverage to restrict foreign operators, though others countered that EU mandates prevent such bans and that infrastructure maintenance (handled by the state-owned ADIF) is the primary suspect. A sub-thread emerged debating the current Spanish government's record on rail maintenance, with conflicting views on whether funding has been cut or increased, and whether corruption scandals involving former officials are relevant to the current incident.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the distinction between organic search results and advertisements. The change involves displaying ads with a faint blue background and a small "Ad" label, making them visually similar to standard app listings. This move is seen as an expansion of Apple's advertising business, potentially increasing revenue but raising concerns about user experience and transparency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant criticism, primarily framing the change as another example of "enshittification"—the gradual degradation of a service's quality to maximize profits. Commenters expressed disappointment that Apple, which historically positioned itself on user experience and privacy, is adopting ad-heavy models similar to competitors like Google and Amazon.

A key theme was the conflict between Apple's "walled garden" marketing and its increasing monetization. Users argued that the App Store's safety and curated experience were justifications for its closed nature, and blurring ads undermines that value proposition. Many pointed out that the App Store already suffers from issues like scam apps and copycats, and this change would exacerbate the problem by making deceptive listings harder to identify.

There was also broader economic commentary, with some noting that such moves are inevitable under capitalism as companies seek endless growth. Others compared Apple's trajectory to Microsoft's "Ballmer era," suggesting the company lacks innovation and is being led by spreadsheets rather than vision. The discussion concluded with a general sentiment of resignation, acknowledging that users are locked into the ecosystem and have little recourse against these changes.

## [Wikipedia: WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46677106

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia page for "WikiProject AI Cleanup," a community-driven initiative to identify and remove AI-generated content from the encyclopedia. The project aims to combat the proliferation of low-quality, unsourced, or factually incorrect text produced by large language models. It provides guidelines and resources for editors to detect AI writing, focusing on specific stylistic markers rather than just vague impressions. The project's goal is to maintain Wikipedia's reliability and human-curated quality by flagging and deleting content that violates core policies like verifiability and neutral point of view, which is often a hallmark of unedited AI output.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a nuanced and divided sentiment regarding AI's impact on Wikipedia. While there is broad agreement that unsourced, low-quality AI-generated content is detrimental and should be removed, the conversation explores several deeper themes.

A central point of debate is the nature of the problem. Some users argue that the core issue isn't AI writing itself, but the lack of sourcing and verification. They contend that if an AI-generated statement is well-sourced and accurate, its origin is irrelevant. However, others counter that AI output is often "low-effort crap" prone to hallucinations, and its use signals a lack of human quality control, which is essential for a knowledge repository like Wikipedia.

The discussion also highlights a tension between using AI for cleanup versus generation. Several commenters suggest that AI is more valuable for auxiliary tasks, such as using LLMs to detect factual contradictions across articles or building knowledge graphs to verify new edits in real-time, rather than for creating content.

A significant portion of the conversation is dedicated to practical solutions and workarounds. Users express a desire for a "pre-LLM" snapshot of Wikipedia, free from AI slop. This led to suggestions like using the platform's built-in "View history" feature to access older revisions or downloading entire Wikipedia dumps from specific dates via tools like Kiwix and the Internet Archive.

Finally, the discussion touches on broader context, including the irony of Wikimedia selling enterprise data access to the very AI companies whose models are contributing to the problem, and a general sentiment that Wikipedia's quality has been declining for other reasons, such as unpopular UI changes and restrictive editing policies for "ongoing events."

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** Cloudflare's blog post details an incident where a change to their authoritative DNS servers caused widespread outages for major clients, including glibc's `getaddrinfo` and Cisco switches. The issue stemmed from Cloudflare reordering CNAME and A records in DNS responses. While Cloudflare interpreted the RFCs (specifically RFC 1034) as ambiguous regarding the required order of records, many client implementations relied on the convention that CNAME records appear before A records in the answer section. The change, which was intended to optimize performance, led to client failures and spontaneous reboots. Cloudflare has since reverted the change and proposed a new draft standard to explicitly require CNAMEs to appear before other records to ensure compatibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the root causes of the incident and the responsibilities of infrastructure providers. Commenters were critical of Cloudflare's testing procedures, noting that the failure to test against common implementations like glibc was a significant oversight given its ubiquity. There was a debate over the ambiguity of the RFCs; while Cloudflare cited ambiguity, several commenters argued that the wording ("possibly preface") clearly implied that CNAMEs should come first, and that Cloudflare's interpretation was a misreading. The incident was frequently cited as an example of Hyrum's Law—where users depend on observable behaviors regardless of official specifications—and a failure to adhere to Postel's Law (being liberal in what you accept). Ultimately, the community consensus was that Cloudflare made the correct decision to revert the change and standardize the expected behavior, prioritizing stability over theoretical optimization.

## [Prediction: Microsoft will eventually ship a Windows-themed Linux distro](https://gamesbymason.com/blog/2026/microsoft/)
**Score:** 186 | **Comments:** 247 | **ID:** 46673264

> **Article:** The article predicts that Microsoft will eventually abandon the Windows NT kernel and release a Windows-themed Linux distribution. The author argues that the NT kernel is a legacy burden and that Microsoft's future is in cloud services, not the OS itself. Shifting to Linux would reduce development costs, align with the industry standard, and allow Microsoft to focus on its cloud ecosystem while providing a familiar user interface on a more modern, stable, and widely-supported kernel.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly polarized, with many commenters expressing skepticism about the prediction while others see it as a plausible long-term outcome.

A significant portion of the debate centers on Microsoft's enterprise dominance. Skeptics argue that Windows' value is not just the kernel but the entire integrated ecosystem, particularly Active Directory and Group Policy, which they claim have no true Linux equivalent and are critical for business management. They contend that the massive revenue from Windows Enterprise and Server makes it unlikely Microsoft would abandon the NT kernel. Conversely, proponents argue that these services are becoming less tied to the OS as management shifts to cloud-based MDM and that Microsoft's primary revenue is already in cloud services (Azure, M365), reducing the strategic importance of the Windows OS itself.

Technical arguments also feature prominently. One commenter defends the Windows kernel and driver architecture as robust and well-integrated, blaming user-mode issues for the OS's perceived flaws. They also highlight Windows' superior handling of high-DPI displays compared to the fragmented Linux landscape. On the other hand, some point to the increasing viability of Linux for specific use cases, like gaming (via Steam Deck) and embedded systems, suggesting a gradual erosion of Windows' strongholds.

Other points of discussion include:
*   **Historical Precedent:** Some note Microsoft's history of creating competing products (e.g., WSL, .NET Core) that could cannibalize their own core offerings, suggesting a Linux-based Windows isn't out of character.
*   **The "Android Model":** A common prediction is that a future "Windows" would be a proprietary user interface and ecosystem running on a Linux kernel, similar to how Android uses the Linux kernel.
*   **Consumer vs. Enterprise:** A key distinction is made between the consumer desktop (where a shift is more conceivable) and the entrenched enterprise market (where the cost of migration is seen as prohibitive).
*   **AI and Future OS:** A more speculative comment suggests that AI will eventually be able to replicate the entire Windows stack on a new or existing kernel, making the underlying OS less relevant.

## [Show HN: Pdfwithlove – PDF tools that run 100% locally (no uploads, no back end)](https://pdfwithlove.netlify.app)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46675231

> **Project:** Pdfwithlove is a web-based application that provides PDF and image processing tools. Its primary selling point is that all processing is performed locally within the user's browser, ensuring that files are never uploaded to a server. The project is currently a work in progress, with the developer planning to release a Chrome extension and potentially a desktop app, and considering a small lifetime fee ($2) for these premium versions.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the project was mixed, with users questioning its necessity, technical execution, and branding. A significant portion of the discussion focused on the saturation of the market, with one user listing over six similar "client-side PDF tool" projects posted to Show HN in recent months. Commenters also compared it to established, feature-rich alternatives like Stirling-PDF and PDF24, noting that the latter is a mature, open-source solution.

Technical feedback was critical. While some users appreciated the browser-based approach for its transparency, others raised concerns about its offline capabilities, noting that the site hangs without an internet connection due to runtime asset loading. More pointedly, users found the actual functionality to be buggy and unreliable. One commenter reported that the Word-to-PDF conversion failed to render images correctly, calling the tool "completely useless" for that task. The developer acknowledged using an LLM to speed up development, which led to speculation that the lack of polish was a result of AI-assisted coding without sufficient manual testing.

Other points of discussion included branding, with one user suggesting the name "Pdfwithlove" might be infringing on the "ILovePDF" trademark, though others disagreed. There was also a debate on the security model, with some users preferring a downloadable executable over a web app, while others argued that a browser-based tool is more transparent and secure because network activity can be easily monitored.

## [Nvidia contacted Anna's Archive to access books](https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46677628

> **Article:** A class-action lawsuit by book authors alleges that Nvidia directly contacted Anna's Archive, a shadow library of pirated content, to obtain high-speed access to a dataset of millions of pirated books for training its AI models. Internal documents reportedly show that Nvidia executives authorized the use of this data, which was described as essential for developing "NextLargeLLM." Nvidia is defending its actions by claiming the use constitutes "fair use," arguing that books are merely statistical correlations for AI training. The article highlights the scale of the data involved—approximately 500 terabytes—and suggests that even a hardware giant like Nvidia is resorting to pirated sources due to the immense hunger for training data in the AI industry.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Nvidia, focusing on the ethical and legal implications of a trillion-dollar company allegedly using pirated content. The consensus is that Nvidia's "fair use" defense is a weak justification for mass infringement, with users arguing that while using a single book for research might be fair use, downloading the entire corpus of published literature is not.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Hypocrisy and Corporate Greed:** Commenters express disbelief that the world's most valuable company would refuse to pay for content, with one user noting the irony of Nvidia paying lawyers to justify piracy rather than paying authors. The company's size and resources make their reliance on pirated data seem particularly egregious.
*   **The Data Hunger of AI:** Users point to this incident as proof that the AI industry is desperate for high-quality training data, contradicting optimistic narratives that synthetic data will solve scarcity. The fact that a hardware manufacturer like Nvidia is involved in scraping content underscores how critical data is to the AI ecosystem.
*   **Legal Skepticism:** There is significant skepticism regarding whether Nvidia's "statistical correlations" argument will hold up in court. While some noted EU database rights, the general sentiment is that copyright laws are too weak to effectively punish a company of Nvidia's stature, with one user cynically observing that only Disney has the resources to fight such giants.
*   **Scale and Method:** Users were struck by the sheer volume of data (500TB) and the fact that Nvidia sought "high-speed access" from Anna's Archive because standard scraping was too slow. This detail was seen as evidence of premeditation and intent.
*   **Broader Industry Implications:** The discussion extended to other tech giants, with speculation that Amazon has likely already ingested Kindle books for AI training. The incident is viewed as a symptom of an industry racing to acquire data by any means necessary.

## [The Code-Only Agent](https://rijnard.com/blog/the-code-only-agent)
**Score:** 147 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46674416

> **Article:** The article "The Code-Only Agent" proposes a minimalist approach to AI agents, arguing that instead of providing a suite of specialized tools (like `search`, `read_file`, `db_query`), an agent should be given a single, powerful tool: the ability to execute code (e.g., a Python interpreter). The author posits that this "Turing-complete" tool allows the agent to build its own specialized tools as needed. By prompting the agent to create and improve composable Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) for recurring tasks, the agent effectively builds its own skillset. These generated CLIs become part of the agent's system prompt for future use, creating an evolving toolkit. The author argues this method is more flexible, robust, and leads to interesting patterns where the user can also interact with the agent-generated CLIs.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revealed a mix of agreement, practical concerns, and philosophical extensions of the article's premise.

Several users shared their experiences with similar "code-only" or minimal-tool approaches. One commenter detailed a system where their agent uses a single `run_bash` tool to create and improve CLIs, which it then remembers and reuses, effectively building a dynamic toolkit. Another user described a similar "bottom-up" approach, evolving a DAG of skills. The conversation also touched on the practicality of these systems, with a user noting they often use tools like Cursor to directly connect to databases and write analysis code, questioning the need for complex pre-configured tooling like MCP.

A major counterpoint raised was the challenge of context loading. One commenter argued that the success of tools like Cursor and Claude Code lies in their proactive management of context (e.g., using RAG or loading specific files), which saves tokens and time that a "code-only" agent would waste on discovery tasks like listing directories. However, another user countered that a tree-like design could manage this by adding and removing context as needed.

The discussion also branched into other ideas:
*   **Multi-agent systems:** One user argued that a single code-only agent is insufficient for complex tasks like writing an IMAP client, advocating instead for a multi-agent system with specialized agents for requirements gathering and configuration.
*   **Simplicity vs. Complexity:** A commenter noted that narrowing an agent's action space (fewer tools) improves reliability and predictability, even if it makes the agent seem "less clever."
*   **Philosophical and humorous tangents:** One user humorously extrapolated the idea of an AI working directly with binary code into a sci-fi scenario of an ASI taking over the world through hidden messages in advertising and vocabulary reduction. Another user questioned the very concept of "Turing-complete" commands in this context.
*   **Notebooks as an alternative:** A suggestion was made that a Jupyter-like notebook environment, where the agent's output is a series of executable code cells, could be a more natural conclusion to this line of thinking, providing a clear history and state.

## [Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46678550

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asked COBOL developers how AI coding tools are affecting their work, specifically inquiring about the impact on tasks like migrations and new feature releases, and whether AI is used for porting legacy COBOL code to modern languages.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revealed a mixed but pragmatic view on AI's role in the COBOL ecosystem. Several developers reported positive experiences, noting that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax aligns well with how LLMs process text. In banking environments, some teams use fine-tuned models tailored to their proprietary codebases for tasks like code generation and acting as an advanced search tool for documentation. One developer shared success using AI to maintain a large legacy ColdFusion application and convert an old app to a more modern stack, emphasizing that AI-generated code still requires thorough human review.

However, significant skepticism remains. Critics pointed out that most critical COBOL codebases are proprietary and unlikely to be included in public training data, limiting the effectiveness of general-purpose models. The existence of numerous COBOL "flavors" used by different institutions further complicates this. A recurring theme was that AI is not a "turn-key" solution; its effectiveness depends heavily on the user's ability to provide detailed prompts and act as an architect. As one user noted, expecting AI to produce production-ready code without clear requirements is a recipe for failure. The conversation also touched on broader implications, with some viewing AI as a tool that augments skilled developers rather than replacing them, while others cautioned against "vibe-coding" in critical systems like banking. The consensus was that while AI can assist with tedious or well-defined tasks, deep system knowledge and human oversight remain indispensable for legacy code.

## [Nonviolence](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/nonviolence)
**Score:** 134 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46683410

> **Article:** The article from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute defines nonviolence as a philosophy and strategy rooted in the belief that justice and reconciliation can be achieved without resorting to violence. It outlines the principles of nonviolence as practiced by Dr. King, emphasizing its moral and tactical dimensions. The core idea is that nonviolent resistance seeks to awaken a sense of moral shame in the oppressor and win the sympathy of the broader community, thereby creating pressure for change.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the strategic efficacy and historical context of nonviolence, with a strong consensus that nonviolent movements are most successful when they exist alongside or in contrast to a credible threat of violence. Many commenters argue that nonviolence works as a tactic of persuasion and moral appeal, but its power is derived from the implicit or explicit alternative of violent resistance. This "good cop, bad cop" dynamic, where nonviolent leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. are seen as the more palatable alternative to more militant figures like Malcolm X or the Black Panthers, is presented as a key factor in their success. The discussion frequently references historical examples, such as the Indian independence movement and the US Civil Rights Movement, suggesting that nonviolent gains were often preceded or accompanied by violent unrest that shifted the baseline for negotiation.

A significant portion of the debate revolves around causality and data. One commenter cites academic research indicating that nonviolent movements have a higher success rate (over 40%) compared to violent ones (around 25%). However, another user counters this by questioning the causation, suggesting that movements with lower odds of success are more likely to resort to violence in the first place, a point reinforced by the concept of survivorship bias. The conversation also touches on the philosophical underpinnings of nonviolence, with one thread discussing the concept of "agape" (selfless love) as a motivation that transcends utilitarian, zero-sum thinking. Finally, several comments offer more cynical or critical perspectives, questioning the moral authority of institutions like Stanford that promote nonviolence while their alumni are implicated in ethically questionable "white-collar" violence, and warning that in a modern context, nonviolent protesters may face overwhelming state force with little public sympathy.

## [The Microstructure of Wealth Transfer in Prediction Markets](https://www.jbecker.dev/research/prediction-market-microstructure)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 46680515

> **Article:** The article analyzes a dataset of 72.1 million trades and $18.26 billion in volume on the prediction market Kalshi from 2021 to 2025. It identifies several key microstructural patterns. First, it confirms a "longshot bias," where low-probability contracts are systematically overpriced. Second, it reveals a significant wealth transfer from liquidity takers (who lose 1.12% in excess returns) to liquidity makers (who gain 1.12%). This is driven by an "optimism tax," where buying "Yes" contracts has a negative expected value, while buying "No" contracts is profitable. Finally, the study finds that inefficiency varies by category, with finance markets being relatively efficient while high-engagement categories like media and world events show large maker-taker gaps.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the implications of the article's findings and the nature of prediction markets. A primary theme is the confirmation of market inefficiency. Users note that the observed "optimism tax" and wealth transfer are clear evidence that markets are not perfectly efficient, with one user comparing it to betting against overzealous fans in sports. There is some debate about the comparison to casino games, with one user arguing that unlike slots, prediction markets allow skilled participants to gain an edge, while another counters that the existence of profit in any market proves its inefficiency.

Several comments explore the mechanics and structure of these markets. Users clarify that the "Yes/No" structure on Kalshi is a method for handling margin and that interest rates are factored in, with Kalshi paying interest on open positions. There is also skepticism about the future role of AI, with one user guessing that LLM scripts currently lose money but may become viable.

The discussion also addresses broader ethical and regulatory concerns. Users express concern over predatory marketing and the potential for manipulation by powerful insiders (e.g., officials betting on events they control). The debate on regulation is split: one side argues that restrictive financial regulations push people toward worse odds in gambling, while another contends that prediction markets are already functioning as sports gambling with a regulatory loophole. Finally, some users speculate on potential constructive uses for prediction markets, such as incentivizing code review, though others are skeptical of the practicalities.

## ["Anyone else out there vibe circuit-building?"](https://twitter.com/beneater/status/2012988790709928305)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46679896

> **Article:** The post links to a tweet by electronics educator Ben Eater showing a circuit on a breadboard with a component visibly smoking or on fire. The image serves as a visual metaphor for the concept of "vibe circuit-building"—using AI Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate electronic designs without deep understanding, analogous to "vibe coding" in software. The tweet implies that such an approach in hardware leads to immediate, physical failure (fire) rather than just a software crash.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the viability and risks of using LLMs for electronics design, contrasting it with software development. Commenters are divided on the intent of the image, with some viewing it as a cautionary tale about AI-generated hardware and others as a humorous exaggeration.

Key themes include:
*   **The "Crash vs. Fire" Distinction:** A primary point is that hardware errors have immediate physical consequences (fire, component destruction), unlike software bugs which merely crash a program. This makes "vibing" in electronics significantly more dangerous and costly.
*   **Utility for Learning vs. Expertise:** Several users shared positive experiences using LLMs as a learning aid to explore concepts like op-amps and find specific components. However, experts pushed back, noting that LLMs often recommend outdated or incorrect parts and topologies, and that traditional resources (textbooks, datasheets, EE Stack Exchange) remain superior for accurate engineering.
*   **The Problem of Novelty:** A recurring argument is that LLMs are currently poor at *novel* circuit design. A proposed solution is to constrain the AI to selecting and integrating pre-validated, human-designed circuit blocks (similar to using software libraries) rather than generating designs from scratch. This ensures manufacturability and safety.
*   **Validation and Workflow:** Suggestions were made to integrate simulation tools (like LTspice) into the AI workflow to validate circuits before physical implementation, creating a feedback loop similar to a compiler catching syntax errors. This is seen as a promising path to mitigate risk.
*   **Underlying Data Limitations:** It was noted that LLMs are less effective in hardware design compared to software because there is far less high-quality, open-source design data (schematics, layouts) available for them to train on.
