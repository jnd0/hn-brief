## [Iconify: Library of Open Source Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
**Score:** 502 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46665411

> **Article:** The article links to Iconify, a web-based library offering a vast collection of open-source SVG icons. It functions as a unified interface, allowing developers to browse and search thousands of icons from dozens of popular sets (such as Material Design, FontAwesome, and Phosphor) in one place. The platform provides easy integration for web projects, enabling the use of diverse icon styles without managing multiple dependencies.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response is largely positive, with users confirming the utility of Iconify as a centralized resource for finding and integrating icons. A recurring theme is the debate over the "best" general-purpose icon library, with Material Icons frequently cited as the default due to its extensive coverage and neutral style, though Phosphor Icons are also mentioned favorably.

The discussion quickly pivots to technical implementation details, specifically the challenge of icon optimization and preventing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Users debate the trade-offs between inlining SVGs (which prevents caching and bloats the DOM) versus reserving proper space via width/height attributes or aspect-ratio CSS to maintain stable page layouts. Several commenters also shared examples of using Iconify to power specific projects, including an offline text editor with animated icons.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 483 | **Comments:** 411 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy, framing it as a likely necessity to monetize free tiers and justify its massive valuation. The author argues that while ads in ChatGPT could be subtle (e.g., sponsored follow-up questions or "nudges"), the integration of ads into an AI that users trust for information poses significant ethical risks. The piece suggests that introducing ads might signal that the pursuit of AGI is stalling or that the company is preparing for a public offering by demonstrating revenue potential.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely focuses on the ethical implications, economic viability, and inevitability of advertising in AI interfaces.

**Ethical and User Experience Concerns**
Commenters expressed strong skepticism and concern about the integrity of AI responses if ads are introduced. There is a fear that sponsored content will blur the lines with objective information, effectively "contaminating" the trust users place in LLMs. Some users argued that seeing ads in a paid tier would be unacceptable, though others noted that Google has successfully normalized paying for services that still include ads. A recurring theme was the desire for "unplugging" from ad-driven ecosystems or relying on open-source, local models to avoid this future.

**Economic and Valuation Realities**
Several users debated the financial logic behind an ad strategy. While the article suggests ads are needed to fund operations, some commenters argued that the projected ad revenue is insufficient to support OpenAI's current valuation, suggesting an "AI bubble." Others pointed out that ad revenue is heavily skewed toward wealthy users, creating a paradox where the most valuable customers are the ones most likely to pay for an ad-free experience, yet are also the most lucrative targets for advertisers.

**AGI and Strategic Timing**
The discussion included a debate on what an ad strategy implies about the state of AI development. One commenter liked the article's point that pivoting to ads might mean AGI is not imminent, implying the "hype" is slowing down. However, others countered that advanced models (like Opus or Codex) are already impressive enough to be considered AGI by some definitions, and ads are simply a business necessity for scaling and hardware procurement, regardless of intelligence levels.

**Technical Feasibility**
There was a brief exchange on the difficulty of integrating ads directly into model outputs. One user argued that dynamically injecting ads into generated text would be technically challenging and could degrade the user experience, potentially driving users to less "corrupted" alternatives.

## [Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video](https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting)
**Score:** 445 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46670024

> **Article:** The article from Radiance Fields covers the release of A$AP Rocky's music video for "Helicopter," which prominently features Gaussian Splatting technology. This technique involves capturing a subject (in this case, Rocky and his dancers) using a multi-camera array to create a 3D point cloud representation, or "radiance field." This data was then processed using tools like Houdini and OctaneRender, allowing the production team to composite the 3D models into the video and even relight the scenes in post-production. The article highlights that while the technology requires significant data storage (up to 10TB for 30 minutes of footage), it offers greater flexibility and speed in compositing compared to traditional 2D layering methods.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was a mix of appreciation for the artistic execution and technical curiosity about the underlying technology. Many commenters, including the original poster, were pleasantly surprised to see a mainstream music artist featured on the platform, noting the video's surreal and frenetic energy. There was a consensus that the video's aesthetic—often described as looking like an "old version of Unreal Engine"—was an intentional choice to lean into the unique artifacts produced by dynamic Gaussian Splatting.

Technically, users engaged in a detailed breakdown of the process. Several comments clarified the distinction between Gaussian Splatting and NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields); while both are used for novel view synthesis, Gaussian Splatting utilizes an explicit point cloud representation (millions of tiny, colored blobs) rather than a neural network inference, which makes rendering significantly faster. A creator of the GSOPs tool used in the production chimed in to explain that Houdini was ideal for manipulating these vast point clouds.

Beyond the "how," commenters debated the "why." Some questioned if the complex, resource-intensive process was necessary, suggesting a simple camera drone could have achieved a similar visual result. However, others countered that the value lies in the flexibility and creative options provided in post-production, as well as the novelty of the technology itself. The conversation also touched on the broader implications for VFX, with some speculating this could be an "end state" for production where actors are volumetrically captured and composited later. Finally, the discussion briefly veered into the quality of the album itself, with some users feeling the track didn't live up to A$AP Rocky's previous work.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 436 | **Comments:** 465 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The article is an official statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It expresses grave concern over recent comments and actions by the United States regarding Greenland, reaffirming the principle of territorial integrity and the importance of international law. The statement emphasizes the strong historical ties and cooperation between the signatory nations and the U.S., but underscores that any questioning of sovereignty is unacceptable and undermines the foundation of the transatlantic partnership.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is overwhelmingly critical of the U.S. administration's posture towards Greenland, with commenters expressing shame, frustration, and a sense of impending crisis. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Condemnation of U.S. Actions:** There is near-universal agreement among commenters that the threats against Greenland are "appalling," "disgraceful," and "monstrous." Many U.S. citizens in the thread express personal shame and apologize to European allies, viewing the behavior as a betrayal of long-standing friendships and military alliances, particularly citing the sacrifices made by countries like Denmark in U.S.-led wars.

*   **Political Paralysis and Hopelessness:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the perceived inability of the American political system to stop the executive branch. Commenters argue that the federal government is too powerful, that Congress is ineffective or complicit, and that the Supreme Court would not act as a check. This leads to a sense of fatalism, with some users suggesting it's "over" and that Americans will have no real chance to vote their way out of the situation.

*   **Historical Parallels and Decline:** The conversation frequently frames the current events as part of a larger, historical pattern of imperial decline. Users draw parallels to the fall of the Roman Empire, the British Empire, and others, suggesting that internal hubris and foolish leadership, rather than external enemies, are the primary cause. The phrase "Hard times create strong men..." is used to summarize this cyclical view of history.

*   **Strategic and Economic Calculations:** Some users attempt to analyze the situation from a strategic perspective. They argue that an actual invasion of Greenland would be economic suicide for the U.S. due to Europe's role as a major trading partner and holder of U.S. debt. However, this is countered by the view that the current U.S. administration may not care about such long-term consequences.

*   **Criticism of European Response:** While most agree with the substance of the European statement, a few commenters criticize it as typical EU bureaucracy—slow and limited to issuing statements. This view is challenged by others who see it as a necessary and firm diplomatic response, with one user noting that the EU has previously called out similar behavior from other global powers.

## [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
**Score:** 302 | **Comments:** 210 | **ID:** 46666085

> **Article:** The 2014 article by Adam Drake presents a case study where a simple command-line pipeline (using tools like `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq`) processed a 3.46GB dataset of chess games significantly faster and cheaper than a Hadoop cluster running a Python script via the `mrjob` framework. The CLI pipeline completed in roughly 2.5 minutes, while the Hadoop job took over 4 hours and cost approximately $2.50 in AWS fees. Drake argues that while Hadoop is essential for datasets exceeding the capacity of a single machine, many "big data" problems are actually "big data problems on a small machine." He advocates for mastering standard Unix tools and optimizing single-machine performance before resorting to complex distributed systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the enduring relevance of the article's thesis, with users debating the appropriate thresholds for distributed computing versus single-machine processing. A recurring theme is the critique of modern "cargo cult" engineering, where startups and engineers prematurely adopt complex, expensive distributed stacks (like Airflow, Snowflake, and Hadoop) for datasets that could easily fit on a single machine or even in RAM. Several commenters noted that the problem has arguably worsened since 2014, with layers of abstraction adding overhead and cost without necessity.

However, the conversation also acknowledges the evolution of tooling. While Hadoop is viewed as a "blast from the past," modern single-node analytical databases like DuckDB and ClickHouse are highlighted as powerful alternatives that offer the performance of CLI tools with the usability of SQL. The debate on scaling thresholds varies: some suggest the cutoff is when processing takes longer than a day, while others point to physical disk limits. Ultimately, the consensus leans toward starting with the simplest, most efficient tool available—often a single machine—and only scaling out when the data volume physically necessitates it.

## [Erdos 281 solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro](https://twitter.com/neelsomani/status/2012695714187325745)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 274 | **ID:** 46664631

> **Article:** A Twitter user claimed that "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro" solved Erdos Problem #281, an open question in number theory concerning the density of integers not covered by a system of congruences. The post generated significant attention due to the implication that a frontier AI model had made an original mathematical contribution. However, the model name appears to be fictional, and the underlying proof method (using compactness arguments) was noted by Terence Tao to be a known technique, though the specific application was impressive.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the validity of the AI's contribution and the broader implications for AI in scientific research. The initial excitement was tempered by a significant development: Terence Tao, a leading mathematician, initially praised the LLM's proof for avoiding common logical pitfalls but later downgraded the result after discovering that the core conclusion had actually been established in a 1936 paper by Erdos and Davenport. This revelation shifted the conversation from whether the AI solved a hard problem to the AI's ability to synthesize existing but obscure literature.

Key themes included:
*   **Verification and Authority:** Users relied heavily on Tao's validation. Once he noted the prior art, the community consensus shifted to view the result as a "rediscovery" rather than a novel breakthrough.
*   **AI Capabilities:** Despite the correction, commenters were impressed by the model's ability to handle delicate logical quantifiers and produce a coherent, verifiable proof. The discussion debated whether this constitutes "intelligence" or sophisticated pattern matching.
*   **The "Low-Hanging Fruit" Problem:** Several users pointed out that the Erdos problem list contains a "long tail" of easy, under-explored problems. The AI's success here might reflect its ability to comb through data rather than solve deep, intractable research questions.
*   **Coding vs. Math:** The thread branched into a debate about AI replacing programmers, with some claiming they ship software with minimal coding, while others argued that AI still lacks the "common sense" required for complex software engineering.

## [The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable)
**Score:** 274 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46669404

> **Article:** The article is an official press release from the Nobel Peace Prize organization stating that the Nobel Prize and the Laureate are inseparable. It clarifies that the physical medal and diploma are personal property, but the title of "Nobel Laureate" is an honor bestowed upon the individual that cannot be transferred or sold. The statement emphasizes that the designation remains with the recipient for life, regardless of any subsequent actions or controversies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely treats the press release as a reaction to recent events, specifically the controversy surrounding the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Narges Mohammadi (who was absent) and the subsequent political maneuvering involving the award. The comments are overwhelmingly cynical, focusing on three main themes:

1.  **Criticism of the Nobel Peace Prize:** Many users argue that the Peace Prize is distinct from the scientific Nobel awards, viewing it as a politicized, meaningless, or joke institution. Historical examples like Henry Kissinger and Barack Obama were cited to support the argument that the prize has long been controversial and lacks the merit-based prestige of the science prizes.

2.  **Mockery of Political Ego:** Several commenters used sarcasm to highlight the perceived vanity of leaders obsessed with the award. A recurring thread involved humorous analogies—such as Usain Bolt gifting a gold medal or James Watson selling his Nobel statue—to illustrate the absurdity of treating the prize as a transferable commodity rather than a personal honor.

3.  **Specific Context of the 2024 Prize:** While the press release is generic, the discussion is anchored in the specific context of Narges Mohammadi. One user noted that Assange filed a complaint against the Swedish Nobel Foundation regarding her prize, arguing it violated Nobel's will. Another commenter sarcastically critiqued her decision to "gift" the prize to a foreign leader as a transparent attempt to secure power, though others defended her as a legitimate opposition figure. The consensus was that the situation highlights the prize's entanglement in global politics.

## [Police Invested Millions in Shadowy Phone-Tracking Software Won't Say How Used](https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-police-invest-tangles-sheriff-surveillance/)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46672150

> **Article:** A Texas Observer article investigates how Texas law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Public Safety (DPS), have invested millions of dollars in a secretive phone-tracking software called "Tangles." The software, produced by a company called ShadowDragon, allows police to monitor locations and social media activity in real-time. Despite public records requests, agencies have refused to disclose how or when this tool is used, citing "law enforcement sensitive" information. The article highlights concerns from privacy advocates who argue this technology bypasses traditional warrant requirements by aggregating data from public sources and the "dark web," effectively creating a surveillance state without judicial oversight or public accountability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the implications of warrantless surveillance, the legal loopholes exploited by data brokers, and the difficulty of effecting change. A primary theme is the concept of "parallel construction," where law enforcement uses illicitly or questionably obtained data to establish probable cause for a legal investigation, thereby masking the original source. Commenters express deep skepticism about the legality of these methods, noting that police often purchase data from third-party brokers rather than obtaining it directly, which they argue circumvents Fourth Amendment protections.

There is a debate over the effectiveness and ethics of the software. Some users argue that the specific examples in the article (like tracking a stolen car) are poor justifications for such invasive technology, suggesting the tool might be a waste of taxpayer money or merely a "nothing burger" if the data is just purchased from brokers. However, others counter that the secrecy is intentional to prevent criminals from adapting, drawing parallels to how tech companies handle security vulnerabilities.

The conversation also broadens into a critique of digital privacy in general. Several commenters point out that the root issue lies with data brokers and apps that sell user location data, making it legally accessible to police without a warrant. The discussion concludes with a cynical outlook on the future, with some users fearing that increasing surveillance capabilities will make political dissent or revolution impossible, while others remain skeptical that the U.S. populace will develop the "class consciousness" necessary to resist these encroachments.

## [Flux 2 Klein pure C inference](https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46670279

> **Article:** Salvatore "antirez" Sanfilippo (creator of Redis) announced a new project, `flux2.c`, which is a pure C inference implementation for the Flux.2 Klein image generation model. The project is presented as an experiment in using AI (specifically Anthropic's Opus model) to transpile a Python-based reference implementation into a standalone C library. The goal is to create an inference engine that does not rely on the heavy Python stack, making it easier to embed in applications like game engines or Photoshop. The repository includes implementation notes detailing the process, and while the current version is functional but slow (float32-only kernels), it serves as a proof-of-concept for AI-assisted, low-level systems programming.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the feasibility and implications of using LLMs for complex code generation and porting tasks. Commenters explored the technical nuances of antirez's workflow, noting that maintaining a constantly updated specification file (like `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`) was crucial for the AI's success over long sessions. There was a debate on code quality, with some noting that while AI-generated code is improving, it still requires rigorous review, especially for logic errors and performance optimization.

A significant sub-thread involved the licensing and acceptance of AI-generated code in open-source projects. Users questioned whether code generated by an LLM could be relicensed differently from the original (MIT vs. Apache), and antirez clarified that his implementation went beyond the reference code. Another user shared a similar experiment porting Qwen 3 Omni to `llama.cpp` that was rejected by maintainers, sparking a debate on whether AI-generated kernels are inherently suboptimal or if they represent a new frontier for faster development. The conversation also touched on the performance trade-offs, acknowledging that while pure C offers portability, Python's underlying libraries are already highly optimized C/C++ code, making raw speed gains less immediate than the benefits of embeddability.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-2403016)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46669945

> **Article:** A joint statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK condemns recent U.S. threats against Greenland, Panama, and Canada. The European nations assert that "the sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected" and that "acquiring territory by force is a violation of fundamental international law." The statement emphasizes that the security of the continent is indivisible and calls for de-escalation and adherence to international norms.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is polarized, centering on the feasibility of U.S. expansionism, the reliability of NATO, and the economic trade disputes between the U.S. and Europe.

A significant portion of the comments express alarm and skepticism regarding the U.S. administration's rhetoric. Users debate the practicality of a U.S. military invasion of Greenland or Canada, with some arguing that internal dissent within the U.S. military and lack of public support would prevent such an action. There is a pervasive sense that the U.S. judicial and legislative branches are failing to act as a check on executive power, leaving international allies to rely on diplomatic statements. Some users highlight that Canada's reference to NATO obligations is a subtle signal of the severity of the situation.

Conversely, a minority of users defend the U.S. administration's stance, arguing that European nations have historically engaged in unfair trade practices—such as high VATs and tariffs on U.S. goods—and have underfunded their NATO obligations. These users view the pressure on Greenland as a necessary security measure, citing Europe's perceived lack of credible defense capabilities and the strategic importance of the Arctic region.

Economic grievances are a distinct theme, with one user providing a detailed breakdown of how tariffs and taxes inflate the price of U.S. goods (specifically Harley-Davidson motorcycles) in Europe, characterizing the EU's trade barriers as a significant imbalance. The general consensus among critics is that while Europe needs to increase military spending to ensure its own defense, the current U.S. approach is viewed as "madness" that violates international law.

## [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46666283

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Consent-O-Matic," a browser extension designed to automatically handle cookie consent pop-ups. The tool works by identifying common patterns in consent banners and programmatically selecting the "Reject All" or "Necessary Cookies Only" options, rather than simply hiding the banners or accepting all tracking. The goal is to automate the process of protecting user privacy without requiring manual interaction on every website.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the utility, reliability, and privacy implications of cookie consent extensions. A primary theme is the trade-off between convenience and privacy. While the original poster praises Consent-O-Matic for eliminating manual dismissals, others note that it sometimes fails to work or causes website breakages. Several users compare it to alternatives like uBlock Origin’s "cookie notices" list and the "I don't care about cookies" extension. A significant point of contention is that some extensions, particularly "I don't care about cookies," may default to accepting tracking policies to ensure functionality, potentially undermining privacy goals.

Users also debate the effectiveness of built-in browser features, noting that Firefox's cookie banner reduction feature was deprecated, making third-party extensions necessary. There is a broader frustration expressed regarding the existence of these banners in the first place. Commenters argue that many websites implement consent pop-ups unnecessarily due to a misunderstanding of GDPR requirements or as a form of "civil disobedience" to turn users against the regulations. This has led to "consent fatigue," where users blindly accept tracking to remove the annoyance, rendering the legal protections ineffective.

This word is a fictional compound noun from Aristophanes' comedy *Assemblywomen*, describing a dish combining various meats, fish, and sauces. It is not a word used in actual language but rather a humorous literary invention.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around the technical side effects of posting such a long, unbroken string of characters on Hacker News, which broke the layout of the mobile site. Users noted that the word caused horizontal scrolling and layout issues, with one user initially blaming Apple before realizing it was the word's length. There was a suggestion to use soft hyphens to fix the display issue.

Beyond the technical glitch, the conversation evolved into a celebration of long words and linguistic trivia. Users compared the Greek word to famous English examples like "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" and "antidisestablishmentarianism," with some humorously quoting made-up words from *Blackadder*. A notable thread involved a user humorously responding in an overly verbose, pseudo-archaic style, mimicking the complexity of the post. Other comments included a desire to "taste" the fictional dish and a reference to the "Googlewhack" internet game.

**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46664195

> **Article:** The article is a link to Isaac Asimov's 1957 science fiction short story, "Profession." The story is set in a future where society is strictly stratified. Individuals are "taught" their life professions directly into their brains via electronic tapes at a young age, eliminating the need for traditional learning and critical thinking. The protagonist, George, is an exception; he is a "creative" individual who learns through curiosity and deep understanding rather than rote memorization. The story explores themes of education, conformity, and the nature of true expertise versus superficial knowledge. It culminates in a revelation that the "taped" knowledge is limited and that society relies on a small number of creative thinkers to innovate and solve problems that the standardized education system cannot.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the story's enduring relevance, particularly regarding education, creativity, and the parallels to modern technology like AI. Many commenters praised the story as one of Asimov's best, highlighting its compelling social commentary and satisfying ending. A recurring theme was the story's critique of rigid, standardized education systems that suppress curiosity in favor of conformity. Several users drew direct comparisons between the "taped" humans in the story and modern Large Language Models (LLMs), expressing concern that reliance on AI could discourage deep learning and critical thinking, creating a population of users who can access information but cannot innovate or solve novel problems. The conversation also touched on the story's relevance to the tech industry, with one user drawing an analogy to the Stack Overflow community, suggesting that only those who have struggled with complex problems can truly contribute, while most are content with simple, "canonical" answers. There were also minor discussions about the story's availability in print and a cautionary note about the external website hosting the article.

## [Software engineers can no longer neglect their soft skills](https://www.qu8n.com/posts/most-important-software-engineering-skill-2026)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 202 | **ID:** 46667572

> **Article:** The article argues that in the coming years, soft skills will become the most critical asset for software engineers, surpassing technical prowess. The author posits that as AI tools increasingly handle the mechanical aspects of coding, the human value will shift to abilities like communication, collaboration, business acumen, and project management. The piece suggests that engineers who fail to develop these "human" skills will find themselves at a significant disadvantage in the job market, as their purely technical tasks become more easily automated.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a complex and often skeptical reaction to the article's premise. A central theme is the debate over whether soft skills are a new requirement or have always been essential. Many commenters argue that effective communication and business alignment have long been crucial for career advancement, but the shift is that these skills are now a baseline requirement for survival, not just a path to seniority. The conversation is heavily influenced by the impact of AI, with some noting that AI makes it easier to detect students who lack true understanding, while others worry that the profession may become less accessible to neurodiverse individuals who found a home in its previously more technical focus.

Several commenters express cynicism, viewing the "learn soft skills" advice as a reactive narrative similar to "learn to code" given to other displaced workers, and part of a larger systemic issue where individuals are told to adapt to problems created by industry. There is also a recurring sentiment of friction between technical and non-technical roles, with some engineers expressing frustration with "MBA types" and business strategists they perceive as detached from implementation realities. Ultimately, the consensus leans toward the idea that while soft skills have always been beneficial, AI is poised to transform them from a career accelerator into a fundamental job requirement for most engineers.

## [A free and open-source rootkit for Linux](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1053099/19c2e8180aeb0438/)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 34 | **ID:** 46666288

> **Article:** The linked LWN.net article (behind a paywall, but summarized in comments) discusses "Singularity," a new, modern, open-source rootkit for the Linux kernel. The rootkit uses the Ftrace kernel mechanism to hook and modify kernel functions, allowing it to hide processes/files, disable security features, and enable remote code execution. The article notes that the code is freely available under an MIT license, making it legally simple for anyone to use or modify, though doing so for malicious purposes remains a crime.</Discussion Summary>
The Hacker News discussion revolves around the technical implications, ethical debates, and practical applications of the rootkit. A central theme is the debate over open-sourcing such tools: one commenter humorously lamented that the MIT license allows criminals to use the code without legal copyright infringement, while others noted that public rootkits have existed for a long time and that this tool is arguably more valuable to security researchers and defenders than to attackers.

Technically, users dissected the rootkit's reliance on Ftrace, with some inquiring if the kernel could be compiled without Ftrace support to mitigate such attacks. There was also a practical application mentioned: a user is working on a derivative of the code to hook the VFS for dynamically remapping file paths, specifically to force misbehaving applications to load custom TLS certificates. Other commenters suggested less invasive alternatives for this task, such as using mount namespaces, chroot, or LD_PRELOAD. The tone ranged from humorous (jokes about accepting EULAs for rootkits) to concerned (fears about lowering the barrier for cyberattacks), though the consensus was that the release is not a significant shift in the threat landscape.

## [What is Plan 9?](https://fqa.9front.org/fqa0.html#0.1)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46667675

> **Article:** The linked article is the "Frequently Questioned Answers" (FQA) for Plan 9, a distributed operating system developed at Bell Labs by the creators of Unix. It serves as a FAQ and philosophical guide, explaining Plan 9's design principles, such as "everything is a file," its use of 9P network protocol, and its clean-slate approach to operating systems. The document is written in a style characteristic of the Plan 9 community, offering both technical explanations and commentary on why Plan 9 differs from and, in the authors' view, improves upon traditional Unix systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on Plan 9's legacy, its practical applications, and the philosophy of operating system design. A key theme was Plan 9's real-world influence, particularly its "9p" network protocol. Commenters noted that it is used in Linux (via the v9fs kernel subsystem) and is the underlying technology for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to share files between the host and virtualized Linux environment.

The conversation also explored the tension between Plan 9's simplicity and modern software development. While some users expressed a desire for modern languages like Rust on Plan 9, others defended the system's native C dialect, arguing that its simplicity is a therapeutic and powerful feature compared to the complexity of modern languages. A Rust-based reimplementation of the Plan 9 kernel (R9) was mentioned.

Practically, users acknowledged that while Plan 9 is enjoyable for hobbyists and research, its lack of a modern browser and video acceleration prevents it from being a viable daily-driver desktop OS. The discussion also touched on broader philosophical questions, with some participants arguing that Plan 9's "everything is a file" abstraction is a powerful alternative to modern web APIs and databases, while others felt that OS research is less relevant today as computing moves to the application level.

## [Prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes about gambling](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/america-is-slow-walking-into-a-polymarket-disaster/ar-AA1Upfdb)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46670524

> **Article:** The article, titled "America is slow-walking into a Polymarket disaster," argues that the growing mainstream attention on prediction markets like Polymarket represents a dangerous trend. The author contends that these platforms, which allow users to bet on real-world events, are essentially unregulated gambling masquerading as insightful financial instruments. The core danger highlighted is their susceptibility to manipulation by wealthy and influential actors. A billionaire, for example, could place a large bet on themselves to create a perception of popularity, which news outlets might then report on, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. The article frames this as a "disaster" because it blurs the line between news and gambling, potentially allowing the powerful to manipulate public opinion and perception at a relatively low cost compared to traditional methods like polling or advertising.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted debate on the nature and impact of prediction markets, with commenters falling into several distinct camps.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the potential for manipulation. One side argues that prediction markets, particularly low-volume ones like Polymarket, are highly vulnerable. As one user points out, it becomes cheap for a wealthy entity to manipulate the odds on a thinly traded market, which news outlets might then report, fulfilling Goodhart's Law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." This makes the market's predictive value unreliable once it gains public attention. The opposing view is that manipulation is self-defeating; any attempt to artificially move the odds simply creates a more accurate price for informed traders to profit from, thereby correcting the manipulation.

Another major theme is the comparison of prediction markets to other forms of financial risk and gambling. Some commenters question why Polymarket is considered uniquely dangerous compared to high-risk activities like naked option trading or NFTs, suggesting that "a fool and his money are soon parted." However, others counter that the simplicity and mainstream marketing of platforms like Polymarket make them more accessible and attractive to the average, uninformed consumer than complex financial instruments.

A more philosophical argument, articulated by user keiferski, invokes "Chesterton's Fence," suggesting that gambling has been a known societal problem for centuries and that dismantling traditional barriers against it without a clear understanding of the consequences is reckless. This is tied to a broader critique of a modern ethos that prioritizes acquiring wealth by any means necessary.

Finally, there is a debate over the fundamental utility of prediction markets. While some argue they provide valuable predictive insights that can beat traditional polls, others dismiss them as "corporatized bookies" that are inherently fixed and serve only to enrich those in power. The low stakes of current markets like Polymarket are seen by some as a mitigating factor, while others see them as a dangerous first step toward a much larger and more problematic industry, especially as platforms like Kalshi begin advertising on television.
