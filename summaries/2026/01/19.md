## [Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video](https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting)
**Score:** 653 | **Comments:** 213 | **ID:** 46670024

> **Article:** The article from Radiance Fields covers the release of A$AP Rocky's "Helicopter" music video, which prominently features Gaussian Splatting technology. This technique captures real-world subjects (like the actors) as a 3D point cloud of "splatting" ellipsoids rather than traditional 2D video. The production team used a multi-camera rig to scan the performers, then processed the data in Houdini using GSOPs and OctaneRender. This allowed for rapid compositing, relighting, and the creation of a surreal, frenetic visual style that integrates the 3D scans into the video.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was a mix of appreciation for the artistic execution and technical curiosity about the underlying technology. Users were pleasantly surprised to see a mainstream music artist featured on Hacker News, noting the surreal and energetic aesthetic of the video. While some commenters felt the visual quality resembled an older game engine, others clarified that the "imperfect" look was an intentional artistic choice to lean into the artifacts of dynamic Gaussian Splatting.

Technically, the community engaged in a detailed breakdown of the process. Several users clarified the distinction between Gaussian Splatting and NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields); while both are radiance fields for novel view synthesis, Gaussian Splatting uses an explicit point cloud representation, making it faster to render and manipulate than the neural network inference required by NeRFs. A creator of the specific Houdini toolset used (GSOPs) chimed in to explain that the software excels at manipulating these vast point clouds.

There was also debate regarding the practicality and cost-effectiveness of the technique. Some argued that using a pre-programmed drone might have been cheaper and easier, but others countered that the flexibility of 3D post-production and the unique visual capabilities justify the expense and computational overhead. Finally, the conversation briefly touched on the music itself, with some users critiquing the album's quality compared to previous singles, though most kept the focus on the visual innovation.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 550 | **Comments:** 485 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy. It posits that while OpenAI is currently focused on AGI, the immense capital required for research and hardware will eventually force a pivot to monetization through ads. The author analyzes potential ad formats (e.g., sponsored answers, product placement within responses) and argues that ads will likely appear even in paid tiers, similar to Google's model, because high-value users represent significant ad revenue potential. The piece suggests that the introduction of ads would signal a maturation of the business model rather than a failure of technology, but also warns of the ethical implications of advertising within an AI that users implicitly trust.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters displayed a mix of cynicism, economic analysis, and skepticism regarding the inevitability and impact of OpenAI introducing ads.

**Economic Feasibility and Valuation**
Several users debated the financial reality of the AI industry. One commenter argued that even significant ad revenue would not justify current valuations, suggesting an "AI bubble." Another countered that ad revenue is necessary to fund the massive hardware costs and satisfy shareholders, noting that the ad market may already be over-leveraged with scams and consumerism.

**User Experience and Monetization Models**
There was significant discussion regarding how ads would be implemented. A prevailing theory is that ads will eventually appear in all tiers, including premium ones, because wealthy users are the most lucrative target for advertisers. However, others noted that users hate being "double-billed" (paying for a subscription *and* seeing ads) and predicted that competition would allow users to pay for ad-free API wrappers or alternative open-source models.

**Ethical and Societal Impact**
The most critical comments focused on the danger of embedding ads in trusted AI systems. Users expressed concern that LLMs are viewed as objective authorities by many, making them the "advertiser's wet dream." There is fear that ads will slowly morph from obvious links to subtle product placement within generated text, effectively "contaminating" information. The sentiment was largely that the only way to resist this is to disconnect from predatory subscriptions and build local, open-source alternatives.

**AGI vs. Business Reality**
Some commenters interpreted the move toward ads as proof that AGI is not imminent, suggesting that if true intelligence were achieved, monetization would be secondary. Conversely, others argued that ads are simply a business necessity regardless of how advanced the models become, citing the need for revenue to scale operations regardless of whether the tech is "AGI" or not.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 496 | **Comments:** 495 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The linked article is an official statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The statement expresses deep concern and firm opposition to recent threats by the US administration against the sovereignty of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. The European nations reaffirm their commitment to the UN Charter and the principle of territorial integrity, stating that sovereignty and borders must be respected. The statement serves as a unified diplomatic rebuke of US foreign policy actions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the US administration's threats against Greenland, viewing the statement by European allies as a necessary but alarming response to a destabilizing geopolitical situation. The sentiment is characterized by a mix of shame, resignation, and anxiety among American commenters, while international observers express disappointment and a sense of betrayal.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Criticism of the US Administration:** Commenters universally condemn the threats against Greenland as "appalling," "disgraceful," and "monstrous." Many view this as a continuation of a pattern of behavior that undermines alliances and international norms. The "Mad King" metaphor is used to describe the perceived irrationality of the policy.
*   **American Shame and Helplessness:** A significant portion of American commenters express apology and shame for their government's actions. There is a strong sense of powerlessness, with some arguing that domestic political structures (e.g., a compliant Supreme Court, a paralyzed Congress) are insufficient to check executive power, leading to fears that the "post-American world" is already beginning.
*   **Damage to Transatlantic Relations:** Several users, including one self-identified as a US citizen living in Finland, note that the relationship between the US and its European allies is "permanently harmed." The historical context of allies fighting and dying together (e.g., in Afghanistan) is cited to highlight the depth of the perceived betrayal.
*   **Skepticism of European Power:** A counter-narrative emerges, with some commenters dismissing the joint statement as weak "bureaucracy" typical of the EU. However, this is challenged by others who argue that the EU possesses significant economic leverage, such as holding US debt, and that the real test will be whether Europe can effectively call the administration's bluff.
*   **Historical Parallels and Political Strategy:** The discussion includes broader reflections on the nature of empires, with some users comparing the US's trajectory to historical declines driven by internal hubris. Others speculate on the administration's motives, suggesting the Greenland threat is a distraction from other controversies, such as the Epstein files.

## [Dead Internet Theory](https://kudmitry.com/articles/dead-internet-theory/)
**Score:** 365 | **Comments:** 455 | **ID:** 46671731

> **Article:** The article explores the "Dead Internet Theory," a conspiracy theory suggesting that the majority of internet traffic, content, and social interactions are generated by AI and bots rather than humans. The author examines the theory's origins and its increasing plausibility in the age of large language models (LLMs). The piece highlights linguistic markers often attributed to AI, such as specific phrasing and the use of em-dashes, while also noting that human writing patterns can mimic these traits. It touches on the economic incentives for platforms to allow or even generate bot traffic to inflate engagement metrics and ad revenue, and concludes by considering the internet's potential future as a "dark forest" where human communities become isolated pockets of authenticity amidst a sea of AI-generated slop.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the core premise of the Dead Internet Theory, with many commenters sharing personal experiences of encountering bot-like behavior on platforms like Reddit. A key point of debate was the reliability of linguistic "tells," such as the use of em-dashes or specific phrases. While some noted these are common among certain human groups (e.g., salespeople, long-time HN users), others expressed frustration that AI has co-opted these stylistic choices, forcing them to alter their own writing to avoid being mistaken for a bot.

Several users connected the theory to the economic realities of modern social media, arguing that platforms are financially incentivized to permit or even create bots to drive up engagement and ad revenue, citing Reddit's API changes and IPO as a prime example. The conversation also explored broader philosophical questions about the nature of online communication and whether human text is fundamentally different from LLM-generated content.

Looking toward the future, commenters expressed pessimism about the internet's trajectory. Proposed solutions included creating parallel, invite-only "walled garden" communities and a "Dark Forest" model, where genuine human interaction survives in small, hidden pockets that are difficult for bots and scrapers to find. The overall sentiment was one of concern for the future of authentic online discourse and innovation.

## [Flux 2 Klein pure C inference](https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c)
**Score:** 354 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46670279

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Flux 2 Klein pure C inference," a project by developer Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez). It is a pure C implementation of the inference pipeline for the Flux.2 Klein image generation model, created with the assistance of the LLM Opus 4.5. The project's stated motivation is to provide an inference system that does not rely on the Python stack, aiming to make open AI models more accessible and easier to embed in applications like game engines. The current implementation is noted to be slow as it uses float32-only kernels, but it serves as a foundational, self-contained C codebase.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the implications of using LLMs for complex code generation, the practicality of the project, and the broader trend of moving away from Python-centric AI stacks.

Key themes included:
*   **LLM-assisted development process:** The author, antirez, detailed his workflow, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a constantly updated "IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md" specification file to guide the LLM over a long and complex coding task. Other users confirmed this practice, referring to it as "vibe-speccing" and suggesting the use of experiment logs.
*   **Code quality and maintainability:** A user questioned if the generated code is "production grade." While one commenter deemed it "not enterprise quality," others argued that such criticisms are outdated, noting that modern LLMs like Opus 4.5, when properly guided, can produce idiomatic and well-structured code. The use of a secondary LLM for peer review was also suggested as a quality control measure.
*   **Performance and practicality:** Commenters noted that the pure C implementation is currently slower than Python-based libraries, which are themselves heavily optimized with C/C++ backends. The primary value was seen not in raw speed, but in eliminating the Python dependency, making the model easier to embed and deploy in diverse environments.
*   **Licensing and AI authorship:** A tangential but notable discussion arose around licensing. The author clarified that his work was a from-scratch implementation, not a derivative of the reference code, and thus could be released under a different (MIT) license. This sparked a conversation about the ambiguity of AI-generated code and licensing, with one user sharing an experience where their AI-assisted contribution to an open-source project was rejected.
*   **Broader trend:** The project was seen as part of a larger movement to make AI models more portable and accessible by implementing them in lower-level languages, freeing them from the Python ecosystem.

## [Texas police invested in phone-tracking software and won’t say how it’s used](https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-police-invest-tangles-sheriff-surveillance/)
**Score:** 330 | **Comments:** 93 | **ID:** 46672150

> **Article:** The article from the Texas Observer investigates the use of "Tangles," a phone-tracking software purchased by Texas law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Public Safety. The software, developed by the company PenLink, aggregates vast amounts of location data from various sources, including commercial data brokers and potentially the dark web, to create detailed maps of individuals' movements. Despite significant taxpayer investment (millions of dollars), police officials have refused to disclose specific details about how the software is used, citing the need to protect investigative methods. The article highlights concerns that this technology allows law enforcement to bypass traditional warrant requirements for location tracking by purchasing commercially available data, effectively conducting "warrantless geo-fence tracking." It raises serious questions about privacy, civil liberties, and the lack of transparency and oversight regarding powerful surveillance tools adopted by local police forces.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply skeptical of government surveillance and concerned about privacy rights. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Privacy and Civil Liberties:** The dominant sentiment is one of alarm. Users express frustration that law enforcement is using purchased data to circumvent the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. Commenters argue that this practice constitutes "parallel construction" (using illegally obtained information to create a legitimate-seeming investigative trail) and a violation of rights, even if the police claim they only use the data to establish "probable cause" rather than as direct evidence.

*   **Data Brokers and Commercial Exploitation:** Several users point out that the root of the problem lies in the commercial data ecosystem. They argue that because users "willingly" (often unknowingly) grant location permissions to apps, that data is sold to brokers and subsequently purchased by the government. This shifts some blame from the police to the data brokers and the apps that collect the data, though it doesn't absolve the police of using it.

*   **Transparency and Secrecy:** There is significant criticism of the police's refusal to disclose how the software is used. Users argue that while law enforcement claims secrecy is necessary to catch criminals, transparency is equally vital to prevent government overreach and abuse of power.

*   **Cynicism and Hopelessness:** A recurring theme is a sense of futility. Several commenters express the belief that despite public outcry and media coverage, nothing will change. They view this surveillance as an inevitable progression in a society with weak regulation and a compliant populace, leading to a future where dissent is impossible.

*   **Practicality and Efficacy:** One user offered a counterpoint, suggesting the software might be a waste of taxpayer money and that traditional police work (like checking security cameras) could achieve similar results. However, others countered that the ability to bypass warrants and search massive datasets is precisely why police value the software.

## [The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46669404

> **Article:** The article is an official press release from the Nobel Peace Prize organization asserting that the prize and the laureate are inseparable. It clarifies that the medal and diploma are personal awards that cannot be sold or transferred, emphasizing the symbolic and personal nature of the honor. The statement appears to be a direct response to recent events where the 2024 laureate, María Corina Machado, allegedly handed her medal to former U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the press release, viewing it as a necessary but futile attempt to address a political controversy involving Donald Trump. The commenters largely agree that the statement targets an audience unwilling to listen, with many dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize itself as a politicized and meaningless institution distinct from the scientific Nobel awards.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Criticism of Trump:** Many users described the press release as a reaction to "thin-skinned" and "toddler-like" behavior from Trump, expressing embarrassment regarding his fixation on the award.
*   **Devaluation of the Nobel Peace Prize:** A recurring sentiment is that the Peace Prize is a "joke" compared to the scientific Nobels. Users cited historical controversies (Henry Kissinger, Barack Obama) and the recent Machado award to argue that the prize is purely political and lacks the meritocratic weight of the scientific awards.
*   **Satire and Analogies:** Commenters used humor to highlight the absurdity of the situation. Comparisons were drawn to Usain Bolt giving away his gold medal or James Watson selling his Nobel statue, with users sarcastically claiming titles based on hypothetical transfers of ownership.
*   **Political Context:** The discussion delved into the specific context of Machado handing her medal to Trump. While some defended Machado as a legitimate opposition leader, others viewed the act as a "transparent attempt" to secure foreign intervention. There was also a debate about the psychology of Trump's voter base, with some suggesting they enjoy seeing him disrupt established institutions.

## [A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth](https://bitchat.free/)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46675853

> **Article:** The article links to "Bitchat," a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth. The tool is designed to enable communication without relying on internet connectivity or central servers, using Bluetooth to connect nearby devices directly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Bitchat centers on skepticism regarding its practicality, concerns about its creator, and comparisons to existing alternatives. A primary point of contention is the limited range of Bluetooth (typically under 400 meters), with users debating whether this is sufficient for real-world use cases like protests or festivals where cellular networks are congested. While some see potential utility in offline scenarios, others argue the range is too restrictive for effective communication.

A recurring theme is the comparison to Briar, a more established offline messaging app that supports Bluetooth and Tor. Several commenters expressed a preference for Briar, citing its open-source nature and security audits, while others noted Briar's lack of an iOS app as a significant drawback. Technical critiques of Bitchat focused on its lack of "store-and-forward" capabilities; without message caching and retransmission by intermediate nodes, the app is limited to real-time conversations between currently connected peers.

Personal and financial critiques of the project's creator, Jack Dorsey, also sparked debate. While some users expressed distrust of his involvement, others engaged in a tangential discussion about "fuck-you money," analyzing the net worth required to live indefinitely in rural or low-cost areas. Finally, the conversation touched on the broader desire for a resilient, decentralized internet alternative, with users expressing frustration with the bugs and limitations of current P2P file transfer and messaging technologies.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-2403016)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46669945

> **Article:** The linked article is a joint statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. The statement expresses strong concern and firm opposition to recent statements and actions by the United States regarding Greenland. Specifically, it rejects any suggestion of the use of military force to acquire or control Greenland, emphasizing that borders and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law. The statement reaffirms the nations' commitment to the sovereignty of allied nations and the stability of the transatlantic partnership, implicitly criticizing the U.S. administration's rhetoric as a threat to these principles.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is highly polarized and extends far beyond the content of the statement itself, focusing largely on the political implications of a potential U.S. administration policy toward Greenland.

A significant portion of the conversation is driven by alarm and speculation regarding the U.S. political climate. Several users express deep concern, viewing the statement as a necessary diplomatic response to what they perceive as erratic and aggressive behavior from a potential future U.S. administration. These comments often escalate to hypothetical scenarios, including the possibility of military conflict between the U.S. and its traditional allies like Canada, and a loss of faith in the U.S. political system's ability to self-correct.

Conversely, a dissenting viewpoint argues that the U.S. administration's focus on Greenland is strategically sound. This perspective posits that Denmark and Europe lack the credible military capability to defend the strategically vital territory, especially as Arctic ice melts. Proponents of this view suggest that the status quo is untenable and that U.S. action, while perhaps undiplomatic, is a necessary response to a security vacuum that adversaries could exploit.

A central point of contention is the credibility of NATO's collective defense clause, Article 5. One user dismisses it as an "untested foundation myth," arguing that political will is the true determinant of its effectiveness. This claim is directly challenged by others who point to the invocation of Article 5 after the 9/11 attacks, highlighting the significant military support and sacrifices made by European allies in Afghanistan and Iraq in defense of the United States.

Finally, some users offer more pragmatic or strategic analysis. One commenter suggests that the most effective response from European nations would be to increase their own military spending and capabilities to independently secure their region. Another comment connects the issue to broader geopolitical trends, such as the need for sovereign military development in relation to China. The discussion also includes a minor meta-thread about a duplicate post on the forum.

## [Prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes about gambling](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/america-is-slow-walking-into-a-polymarket-disaster/ar-AA1Upfdb)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46670524

> **Article:** The article argues that the mainstreaming of prediction markets like Polymarket represents a dangerous "slow walk" toward a world where news becomes indistinguishable from gambling. It posits that while these markets are often touted for their predictive accuracy, their increasing visibility on major news outlets creates a feedback loop. This loop allows wealthy individuals or entities to manipulate market odds cheaply, thereby influencing public perception and news narratives. The author warns that this trend blurs the line between information and speculation, turning serious political and economic events into high-stakes betting opportunities that can be easily gamed.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide between those who see prediction markets as valuable information tools and those who view them as easily manipulated gambling platforms.

A central theme is the debate over market manipulation. Skeptics argue that Polymarket's relatively low trading volumes make it vulnerable to being "gamed" by those with money and influence, especially as news outlets report on the odds. This leads to a Goodhart's Law scenario where the measure (market odds) becomes a target and ceases to be a good indicator of reality. Conversely, others contend that manipulation is difficult and costly, and that any significant market distortion would be quickly corrected by savvy traders seeking profit.

Many comments contextualize the trend as part of a broader, concerning rise in the gamification of finance and society. One user drew a historical parallel to the monetary debasement in Revolutionary France, quoting a 19th-century text to argue that widespread speculation and a loss of faith in stable value are often precursors to societal collapse. Others invoked Chesterton's Fence, questioning the wisdom of dismantling long-standing barriers to gambling without fully understanding the consequences. The general sentiment among critics is that these platforms are simply "corporatized bookies" that enable a new form of racketeering for the powerful.

Finally, there is a discussion on the practical utility of these markets. Proponents point out that they have historically outperformed traditional polls in predicting election outcomes. However, this is countered by the argument that their predictive power is fragile; once they become widely reported, the cost of manipulating the market to influence the news becomes far cheaper than the cost of influencing public opinion through traditional campaigning. The conversation also touched on how the accessibility of these platforms compares to other financial instruments like options trading, suggesting they may attract a broad, uninformed audience.

## [Software engineers can no longer neglect their soft skills](https://www.qu8n.com/posts/most-important-software-engineering-skill-2026)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 233 | **ID:** 46667572

> **Article:** The article argues that as AI tools become more capable of handling routine coding tasks, the most valuable and future-proof skill for software engineers will be their "soft skills"—such as communication, business acumen, and project management. It posits that technical execution is becoming a commodity, and the real differentiator will be an engineer's ability to understand context, align with business goals, and collaborate effectively. The author suggests that by 2026, engineers who neglect these skills will be at a significant disadvantage in the job market.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revealed a complex and often skeptical reaction to the article's premise. While many commenters agreed that soft skills have always been important, the debate centered on whether AI is fundamentally changing the necessity of these skills for survival in the profession.

A central theme was the impact of AI on the software engineering job market. Some argued that AI will primarily eliminate roles for those who are merely "ticket-takers" and lack deep engineering understanding, forcing the profession to elevate its standards. Others expressed concern that this shift could disproportionately affect neurodivergent individuals or those who found a home in programming precisely because it offered a path to success that was less dependent on traditional social prowess. This led to a broader debate on whether the profession is becoming less accessible.

The conversation also touched on the nature of soft skills themselves. Some commenters distinguished between genuine communication and collaboration skills and what they pejoratively termed "MBA-speak" or corporate politics, expressing frustration with the latter. A counterpoint was made that fundamental human skills like building trust and bringing people along are not niche corporate tactics but essential for effectiveness.

Finally, a significant thread, led by a highly upvoted comment, reframed the entire issue as a systemic problem. This perspective argued that the constant demand for individuals to "reskill" (e.g., truckers learning to code, now coders learning soft skills) is a distraction from larger, upstream issues created by industry and a lack of systemic solutions, such as Universal Basic Income (UBI). This introduced a more cynical and macroeconomic view, suggesting that individual adaptation may not be enough to solve the coming disruption.

## [What is Plan 9?](https://fqa.9front.org/fqa0.html#0.1)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46667675

> **Article:** The linked article is the "Plan 9 Frequently Asked Questions" (FQA), a comprehensive guide to the Plan 9 operating system. It explains Plan 9's origins at Bell Labs as a successor to Unix, designed for distributed computing environments. The document details its core design principles, including the "everything is a file" abstraction, per-process namespaces, and the use of specialized protocols like 9P for communication. It covers the system's architecture, from the kernel to user-space tools, and contrasts it with traditional Unix systems, highlighting its unique approach to handling resources and building distributed systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community with a mix of nostalgia, practical interest, and philosophical debate about Plan 9. Key themes include:

*   **Modern Relevance and Practical Use:** Commenters discuss Plan 9's tangible influence on modern systems. The 9P protocol is highlighted as the foundation for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) filesystem integration and is praised in Linux's v9fs driver for its network-native design, which some prefer over FUSE. However, practical adoption as a daily-driver OS is seen as challenging due to a lack of modern browsers and video acceleration, confining it to a "toy" or server environment for most enthusiasts.

*   **Philosophy and Simplicity:** A significant point of discussion is the appeal of Plan 9's simplicity. One user describes returning to Plan 9 from more complex modern languages like Swift and C++ as "therapy," valuing its clean design. This simplicity is contrasted with the perceived complexity of modern systems, with one user arguing that Plan 9's "everything is a file" philosophy offers an alternative to the dominant paradigms of web APIs and SQL databases.

*   **Development and Ecosystem:** The conversation touches on the tools and languages used. While one user expressed a desire for Rust on Plan 9, another countered that the system's native C dialect is a "nice clean language" that fits the research OS well. The existence of a Rust-based reimplementation (R9) was noted, though its quality is unknown. The ongoing vitality of the Plan 9 community was affirmed by pointing to the active 9front development branch and an upcoming international conference.

*   **Historical Context and Legacy:** Users placed Plan 9 in its historical lineage, noting it was a transitional step between Unix and its successor, Inferno. A discussion on BSD sockets versus Plan 9's filesystem approach revealed a preference for Plan 9's unified I/O model, with one user calling the BSD socket interface a "failure" for not fully embracing the filesystem abstraction for network communication.

## [Prediction: Microsoft will eventually ship a Windows-themed Linux distro](https://gamesbymason.com/blog/2026/microsoft/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 212 | **ID:** 46673264

> **Article:** The article predicts that Microsoft will eventually release a Windows-themed Linux distribution. The author argues that the traditional Windows desktop is becoming increasingly irritating and that Microsoft's core business has shifted to cloud services (Azure, M365). Maintaining the Windows OS stack is becoming a costly burden for a product that contributes a shrinking percentage of revenue. The author suggests that by adopting Linux, Microsoft could reduce development costs, focus on its cloud ecosystem, and potentially capture the gaming market, which is increasingly moving toward Linux compatibility via tools like Proton. The piece posits that this shift is a logical long-term evolution rather than an immediate possibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a divided view on the feasibility and likelihood of Microsoft shipping a Windows-themed Linux distro.

**Arguments Against the Prediction:**
*   **Enterprise Ecosystem Lock-in:** Several users argue that Microsoft’s dominance is secured by the "Microsoft Tax"—the integrated ecosystem of Active Directory, Group Policy, and Exchange. One commenter notes that while Linux alternatives exist, they require significant "assembly" and engineering salary to maintain, whereas Microsoft offers a turnkey utility.
*   **Technical Superiority of Windows Core:** A Windows system developer argues that the NT kernel and driver architecture are technically superior to Linux, particularly regarding backward compatibility, high-DPI scaling, and the sheer volume of maintained user-mode libraries. They contend that Windows' problems lie in the user interface, not the core OS.
*   **Revenue Reality:** Critics point out that Windows Enterprise and Server revenue remains in the billions. Since Microsoft must maintain the NT kernel for Azure and M365 anyway, they have little incentive to abandon their cash cow on the desktop.

**Arguments For the Prediction:**
*   **Shifting Business Priorities:** Supporters note that Windows contributes only about 11% of Microsoft's revenue, with the vast majority coming from cloud services. As the OS becomes a delivery mechanism for services rather than a primary product, reducing the cost of maintaining the OS stack becomes attractive.
*   **Enterprise Frustration:** Some sysadmins argue that managing Windows endpoints is becoming a "PITA" due to forced telemetry, surveillance, and inconsistent security defaults. As enterprises move away from on-premise Active Directory to MDM and SSO, the traditional Windows stack becomes a liability rather than an asset.
*   **The "Fragmentation" Precedent:** Commenters point to Microsoft's history of releasing competing products (e.g., WSL, competing Linux subsystems) and argue that they might fragment their own portfolio again to maintain relevance.
*   **Gaming and Community Pressure:** The rise of Linux gaming (via Proton/Steam Deck) and developer demand for an open environment were cited as external pressures that could force Microsoft's hand.

**Nuanced Perspectives:**
*   **The "Android" Model:** Several users suggested that if Microsoft moves to Linux, it would likely be a heavily modified, proprietary layer on top of a Linux kernel (similar to Android or ChromeOS), rather than a standard open-source distro.
*   **The "Year of Linux Desktop" Skepticism:** Some users viewed the prediction as a rehash of the long-standing "Year of Linux Desktop" trope, suggesting that while Microsoft might abandon the NT kernel eventually, it won't necessarily result in a traditional Linux desktop experience.

## [High-speed train collision in Spain kills at least 39](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedw6ylpynyo)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46673453

> **Article:** The BBC article reports on a high-speed train collision in Spain that killed at least 39 people. The incident involved a Frecciarossa 1000 train, which was designed in Italy. The cause of the crash is currently unknown and under investigation. The article notes that high-speed rail in Japan has maintained a fatal-accident-free record for 60 years, providing a contrast to this tragedy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly evolved from initial condolences and safety tips into a multifaceted debate about the cause of the crash and the political state of Spain's rail network.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on technical and historical context. Users identified the specific train model (Frecciarossa 1000) and pointed to a history of manufacturing defects with its maker, AnsaldoBreda, citing a previous derailment and the infamous Fyra train scandal in the Netherlands. This led to speculation about whether the cause was a manufacturer defect, a track issue, or human error. Several users recommended the YouTube channel "Plainly Difficult" for its detailed analyses of historical train crashes and safety engineering.

The discussion then pivoted sharply to politics and infrastructure maintenance. One commenter predicted the incident would be used as political leverage to ban foreign operators from Spain's rail network. This was immediately countered by other users who explained that such a move would violate EU mandates and that the state-owned infrastructure maintainer (ADIF), not the operators, would be the primary suspect in a track-related failure. A heated sub-thread emerged regarding the state of Spain's rail network, with one user accusing the current government of cutting corners on maintenance and linking to articles about corruption and safety incidents. Other users pushed back, arguing that underinvestment is a long-term, bipartisan issue and that the specific track in question had recently been renewed, while also criticizing the "blame game" as premature and disrespectful.

Finally, several commenters provided statistical context to frame the tragedy. They noted that while devastating, such high-speed rail crashes are extremely rare, especially compared to the daily death toll from car accidents in Spain. This led to a brief debate on how to properly compare transportation safety metrics (e.g., deaths per kilometer vs. absolute numbers), reinforcing the point that the news cycle disproportionately covers rare, catastrophic events over more common, mundane dangers.

## [Sins of the Children](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/sins-of-the-children)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46669663

> **Article:** The linked article, "Sins of the Children," is a short story by author Adrian Tchaikovsky published in *Asterisk Magazine*. The story is set in the same universe as his novel *Shroud*, featuring the same ship and characters. It explores themes common to Tchaikovsky's work, such as alien biology, corporate exploitation, and ecological destruction, with a focus on a single-species life-cycle planet.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters praising Adrian Tchaikovsky as a master of hard science fiction, particularly for his inventive world-building and his ability to create truly "alien" aliens. The conversation quickly broadens from the short story itself to a wider appreciation of his bibliography. Several users recommend his other works, with *Children of Time* (the first in a series) being called a favorite by some, while others highlight the *Tyrant Philosophers* series and *Shroud* for their unique concepts and cynical humor.

A significant theme in the comments is the exploration of alien intelligence and ecosystems. Users note that Tchaikovsky excels at crystallizing concepts from biology and psychology into compelling narratives, with one commenter pointing out the recurring motif of humanity as destructive colonizers in modern sci-fi. This leads to a broader discussion about narrative perspectives in the genre, with some users seeking stories where humanity is neither the sole hero nor the villain, but just one participant in a larger universe. Recommendations for authors like Kim Stanley Robinson (*Aurora*) and series like the *Hyperion Cantos* are offered as examples of this more nuanced approach.

## [Show HN: I quit coding years ago. AI brought me back](https://calquio.com/finance/compound-interest)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46673809

> **Project:** The project is a website called Calquio, a collection of financial calculators, with the specific page linked focusing on compound interest. The creator, who hadn't coded in years, used AI (specifically Claude Opus 4) to build the entire application. The stack includes Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui, with the AI selecting these technologies based on a prompt for a "modern and clean" design. The site supports multiple languages (EN, DE, FR, JA).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely centered on the role of AI in software development, with the project serving as a catalyst for this conversation. Many users shared the creator's sentiment, expressing how AI has re-enabled them to code by removing setup friction and allowing them to focus on ideas rather than implementation. This was highlighted by an AI professor who can now pursue personal research again and a former engineer turned farmer who now builds various applications for his farm.

While the project was generally well-received as a "welcome back to coding," several critical points were raised. A significant critique targeted the AI-generated "knowledge base" section of the site, which was described as "slop" and low-quality content. The creator acknowledged this, admitting to being "lazy" and vowing to edit it properly. Other critiques included the high cost of the AI model used ($100/month) compared to alternatives like Copilot, and a comment that the functionality was easily replicable in a spreadsheet. Conversely, the creator defended the cost, stating the quality of the results from their chosen model was superior. A minor feature suggestion for a search function was also made and accepted.

## [Radboud University selects Fairphone as standard smartphone for employees](https://www.ru.nl/en/staff/news/radboud-university-selects-fairphone-as-standard-smartphone-for-employees)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46676276

> **Article:** Radboud University in the Netherlands has selected the Fairphone as the standard smartphone for its employees. The announcement highlights the device's modularity and repairability, noting that the university's IT service desk can stock replacement parts and perform repairs in-house, which is expected to be more cost-effective and sustainable than sending devices to external repair services or replacing them entirely.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practicality, sustainability, and limitations of Fairphone's approach. A key theme was the feasibility of in-house repairs. Several users argued that for an organization of the university's size, maintaining an inventory of spare parts and performing repairs internally is likely more economical and efficient than dealing with external vendors or managing invoices for employee-reimbursed repairs. This was contrasted with a counterpoint that universities might already have similar processes for other IT equipment.

The sustainability of Fairphone's model was also debated. While some praised the company for promoting a longer device lifespan, others were skeptical, sharing anecdotes of friends who had to replace their Fairphones after a few years due to model discontinuation. A recurring suggestion was that buying a second-hand or refurbished phone from a major brand might be a more environmentally friendly and economical alternative. This led to broader calls for legislation mandating that all manufacturers make devices (especially batteries and screens) more repairable.

Technical and product-specific critiques were common. Users expressed disappointment with Fairphone's reliability and performance compared to mainstream brands. Specific hardware limitations were cited as dealbreakers, such as the lack of optical zoom cameras, the use of USB 2.0 instead of USB 3.0, and the absence of DisplayPort support. The discussion also touched on software, with some users highlighting the availability of de-googled operating systems like /e/OS, while others lamented the lack of a truly independent, privacy-focused mobile OS with robust enterprise management features. Finally, a tangential but notable thread emerged from a user's frustration with the lack of a small, non-Google/Apple smartphone with a headphone jack, prompting suggestions for niche devices running alternative operating systems like Sailfish OS or Linux.

## [Show HN: Dock – Slack minus the bloat, tax, and 90-day memory loss](https://getdock.io/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 131 | **ID:** 46671952

> **Project:** Dock is a new chat application positioned as a streamlined, cost-effective alternative to Slack. Its core value proposition is removing common pain points: a flat $15/month fee for up to 20 users (eliminating per-seat pricing), unlimited message history (countering Slack's 90-day limit on lower tiers), and a focus on core chat functionality without "bloat." The product is launching as a Progressive Web App (PWA) built on a custom, local-first architecture using Cloudflare's edge network to minimize infrastructure costs.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response is a mix of skepticism and genuine interest, focusing on the product's viability, technical claims, and market fit.

A central theme is the challenge of competing with established giants like Slack and Microsoft Teams. Several users noted that the biggest barrier to switching isn't price or features, but network effects—specifically, the difficulty of moving external partners and clients off platforms they already use. The developer acknowledged this and is prioritizing a "Guest Access" feature to mitigate the issue.

The pricing model received both praise and concern. While the flat-fee structure is a popular differentiator, some questioned the sustainability of a generous free tier. The developer responded that their custom-built, low-cost infrastructure (leveraging Cloudflare Workers' pay-per-execution model) makes this feasible, unlike traditional architectures with high fixed costs.

Technical architecture was a point of debate. The developer's claim of "100x cost reduction" via Cloudflare was met with skepticism, with one user arguing that managed platforms can be expensive at scale. The founder countered that for a bursty workload like chat, the operational efficiency and lack of idle-time costs outweigh the per-request pricing. Other technical discussions touched on the absence of default end-to-end encryption (E2EE), which the team prioritized for searchability and user experience, and the lack of a self-hosting option, which was a disappointment for some privacy-focused users.

Finally, the discussion explored the philosophy of chat itself. Some argued that unlimited history, while a key selling point, might not be as critical as users think, and that Slack's "bloat" is often the result of years of essential third-party integrations. The developer's position is to focus on a "just works" core experience for teams who don't need that complexity, rather than trying to replicate Slack feature-for-feature.

## [Show HN: Lume 0.2 – Build and Run macOS VMs with unattended setup](https://cua.ai/docs/lume/guide/getting-started/introduction)
**Score:** 129 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46670181

> **Project:** Lume 0.2 is a tool for building and running macOS virtual machines with an unattended setup process. It leverages Apple's Virtualization Framework to create VMs and uses a VNC + OCR system to automatically click through the macOS Setup Assistant, which Apple does not natively support for automation. The project is part of the broader Cua ecosystem, which includes an agent framework for building computer-use agents that can interact with macOS GUI apps and automation tasks.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion highlights Lume's primary use case: running AI agents (like Claude or Codex) that require interaction with macOS-specific features, such as GUI apps (Xcode, Safari) and desktop automation, which is not possible with Docker on Mac. Users compared Lume to alternatives like Tart, noting its agent-first design, unattended setup, and registry support for images. Technical limitations were addressed, including the Apple EULA-enforced limit of two concurrent VMs per physical Mac and the current lack of GPU passthrough (though hints of future support exist). Networking appears stable on the latest macOS version (Tahoe), unlike some other tools. A user inquired about running older macOS versions (e.g., Mojave), but it was noted that IPSW files are for Apple Silicon and older versions may not be supported. The unattended setup method was defended as a practical workaround given Apple's lack of official support for VM enrollment in Apple Business Manager.
