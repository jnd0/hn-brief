# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-19

## [jQuery 4](https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/)
**Score:** 741 | **Comments:** 245 | **ID:** 46664755

> **Article:** The article announces the release of jQuery 4.0.0 on the official jQuery blog. The release marks a significant update to the library, focusing on modernization while maintaining its core utility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the jQuery 4.0.0 release with a mix of nostalgia, practical analysis, and comparisons to modern web development trends.

A primary topic of discussion was **browser compatibility**, specifically jQuery 4's continued support for Internet Explorer 11. While some commenters found this surprising given IE11's deprecation, others defended the decision, noting that many institutions (such as schools) and legacy systems still rely on older hardware and software, making backward compatibility a necessary feature for the library's user base.

The conversation also touched on the **evolution of the web ecosystem**. Several users expressed fondness for jQuery, crediting it with making web development enjoyable and accessible early in their careers. However, others humorously lamented that if jQuery is still relevant in 2026, it implies that React will still be around in 2060, potentially fragmenting into multiple versions over time.

**Technical comparisons** regarding size and functionality sparked debate. One commenter noted that jQuery 4.0.0 is 27 kB (minified + gzipped), which is larger than Preact (4.7 kB). Defenders argued that jQuery does significantly more out-of-the-box and includes legacy browser support, whereas modern frameworks often require extensive additional ecosystem libraries to achieve similar functionality. Additionally, users discussed alternatives like Zepto.js and the "slim" build of jQuery, which removes certain features like AJAX.

Finally, commenters discussed **jQuery's role in modern development**. While some noted that many sites still rely on outdated jQuery versions for simple tasks (like WordPress), others highlighted that even in legacy codebases, organizing "jQuery spaghetti" is possible using reactive patterns. The consensus was that while the industry has moved toward frameworks like React, jQuery remains a reliable tool for specific use cases.

## [Iconify: Library of Open Source Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
**Score:** 512 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46665411

> **Article:** The article links to Iconify, a web-based tool that provides a unified library of over 100,000 open-source icons from dozens of popular icon sets (such as Material Icons, Font Awesome, and Phosphor Icons). It functions as both a searchable database and a development tool, allowing users to easily browse, copy, and implement icons in SVG or code format for web projects.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with several users confirming they use Iconify as their primary icon source. The discussion quickly pivoted from the specific tool to broader best practices for icon implementation in web development.

Key technical topics included:
*   **Icon Preferences:** While users appreciate the variety Iconify offers, many default to Material Icons for their extensive coverage and neutral style. Phosphor Icons were also mentioned as a favorite.
*   **Performance and Layout Stability:** A debate emerged regarding the best way to handle SVGs to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Participants discussed the trade-offs between inlining icons (which prevents layout shift but increases DOM size and prevents caching) versus reserving space via width/height attributes and lazy loading.
*   **Utility:** Users praised the tool for solving the "icon rabbit hole," noting that SVG-based icons allow for easy styling via CSS and eliminate the need for rasterized graphics.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 505 | **Comments:** 436 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy. It suggests that ads are a likely future revenue stream, potentially appearing in the free or lower tiers of ChatGPT. The author argues that while this might seem like a sign of slowing innovation or an inability to reach AGI, it is more likely a pragmatic business move to generate revenue and justify massive valuations as the company scales. The piece explores potential ad formats, such as sponsored answers or product placements within AI responses, and discusses the ethical implications of blending advertising with generative AI.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and critical of the prospect of ads in AI, focusing on the ethical, economic, and technical implications.

A dominant theme is user resistance and the potential for a market split. Many commenters express a strong aversion to "double-billing" (paying for a subscription and still seeing ads) and predict that users will migrate to open-source, locally-run models or alternative paid services to avoid ad-supported AI. There is a consensus that injecting ads could degrade trust and product quality, creating an opening for competitors.

Economically, commenters question the viability of the ad market to support the immense costs of AI. Several users point out that the current AI valuations seem like a bubble, and even a significant increase in ad revenue might not justify them. A notable counter-argument is that ad revenue is heavily skewed towards wealthy users, who are the same users most likely to pay for premium, ad-free tiers—creating a business model conflict that companies like Google have navigated by not offering a fully ad-free search.

The discussion also touches on the technical feasibility and user experience of ad integration. While some fear that ads will become seamlessly and deceptively embedded within AI-generated text, others argue this would be technically difficult, degrade the model's performance, and be easily detectable, ultimately driving users away.

Finally, the conversation includes a debate on whether the move to ads signals a slowdown in the pursuit of AGI. While one article quote suggests it means "your job is safe," a commenter counters that ads are a pragmatic revenue need regardless of AGI's timeline. The overall sentiment is one of caution, with users advocating for building alternatives and "disconnecting" from ad-driven ecosystems.

## [Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video](https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting)
**Score:** 505 | **Comments:** 165 | **ID:** 46670024

> **Article:** The article discusses the release of A$AP Rocky's music video for "Helicopter," which prominently features Gaussian Splatting, a novel volumetric rendering technique. Unlike traditional NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) which use implicit neural representations, Gaussian Splatting utilizes an explicit point cloud of millions of 3D ellipsoids (Gaussians) to represent a scene. This allows for significantly faster rendering and easier manipulation within standard VFX pipelines. The production team captured the performance using a multi-camera array, then processed the data in Houdini using GSOPs (Gaussian Splat Operators) and OctaneRender. This workflow allowed them to relight the actors and composite them into the video with a surreal, slightly artifact-prone aesthetic that leans into the technology's unique look.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of technical curiosity, aesthetic appreciation, and skepticism. The primary point of discussion was the distinction between Gaussian Splatting and NeRFs; several users clarified that while both are radiance fields, Gaussian Splatting uses an explicit point cloud representation rather than an implicit neural network, making it faster to render but potentially less photorealistic in its current iteration.

Users debated the artistic merit of the video. While some felt the "Unreal Engine" look was a downgrade compared to traditional cinematography (e.g., a drone shot), others argued that the surreal, frenetic energy and the embrace of the technology's artifacts were intentional and visually striking. There was a consensus that the flexibility of volumetric capture—allowing for post-production relighting and novel view synthesis—represents a significant shift in VFX workflows, despite the high data requirements (10TB for 30 minutes of footage).

Finally, the discussion briefly touched on the music itself, with some commenters expressing disappointment in the album after a seven-year wait, though others defended the artist's right to release the project as-is and move forward.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 447 | **Comments:** 470 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The article is an official joint statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It addresses recent comments by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the acquisition of Greenland and the potential use of military or economic coercion against Denmark, a NATO ally. The statement firmly rejects any threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of European nations, emphasizing that borders are determined by international law and mutual agreement, not force. It reaffirms the commitment to international order, the rule of law, and the stability of the transatlantic partnership, while implicitly criticizing the aggressive rhetoric coming from the White House.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of President Trump's threats against Denmark and Greenland, viewing the statement as a necessary but insufficient response to a dangerous escalation. The conversation can be grouped into several key themes:

A dominant sentiment among American commenters is one of shame and helplessness. Many express apology for the actions of their government, describing the President as a "Mad King" and lamenting the state of U.S. politics. There is a strong sense of pessimism regarding the American political system's ability to check presidential power, with users arguing that Congress and the Supreme Court are unwilling or unable to act, and that even a change in party control may not reverse the damage. This is coupled with a fear that democratic norms have eroded to a point where laws are no longer meaningful.

Another major theme is the long-term damage to the transatlantic alliance. Several commenters, including an American expatriate in Finland, express that the relationship between the U.S. and its European allies is "permanently harmed." The historical context is invoked, with one user pointing out the particular betrayal felt by Denmark, which lost soldiers fighting alongside the U.S. in NATO missions. There is a consensus that this behavior is not an aberration but a continuation of a pattern of undermining institutions and threatening allies, which has now escalated to a point that can no longer be ignored.

The discussion also touches on the strategic and economic dimensions of the conflict. Some users debate whether Trump's threats are a negotiating tactic or a genuine danger, with most concluding the latter. The economic leverage of Europe is discussed, with the EU holding significant U.S. debt, leading to speculation about whether an invasion would be "economic suicide." However, this is countered by the view that the current administration may not care about such consequences.

Finally, there is a cynical undercurrent regarding the EU's response. While some defend the joint statement as a necessary act of diplomatic unity, others mock it as typical bureaucratic "statement-making" and slow-moving bureaucracy. A recurring point of contention is the idea that the EU is "weak," with some commenters pushing back against this narrative, suggesting that Europe, like China, will eventually call the U.S.'s bluff. The conversation also includes historical parallels, with users comparing the U.S.'s trajectory to the decline of other empires and noting that such threats against smaller nations are not new in geopolitics.

## [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
**Score:** 323 | **Comments:** 218 | **ID:** 46666085

> **Article:** The article, originally from 2014, presents a case study where the author processes a 3.46GB dataset of chess games. They compare a Hadoop cluster (using the mrjob Python library on Amazon EMR) against a simple pipeline of command-line tools (curl, zcat, grep, sort, uniq) running on a single machine. The command-line tools processed the data in approximately 10 minutes, while the Hadoop cluster took over 40 minutes and cost about $2.20. The author argues that for datasets that can fit on a single machine's disk, simpler, single-node tools are vastly more efficient and cost-effective than distributed computing frameworks, which introduce significant overhead. The piece serves as a critique of over-engineering and a reminder to choose the right tool for the scale of the problem.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates the article's core premise, with a consensus that for datasets fitting on a single machine, distributed systems like Hadoop are often unnecessary and inefficient. Many commenters point out that the article's central lesson—that one should avoid premature distribution—is a timeless principle, but the technological landscape has evolved significantly since 2014.

A recurring theme is the evolution of single-machine tools. Commenters highlight that modern tools like DuckDB and ClickHouse can now handle terabytes of data on a single "beefy" server, often outperforming distributed clusters for moderate workloads. This is contrasted with the "Modern Data Stack" (using tools like Snowflake, dbt, Airflow), which some argue has led to increased complexity and cost for datasets that could be processed much more simply and cheaply. The sentiment is that there's a cultural trend in the industry towards over-engineering, where using complex, distributed systems is seen as more "scalable" and career-advancing, even when it's inefficient.

The discussion also touches on the appropriate use cases for distributed systems. While single-machine processing is favored for speed and simplicity, commenters acknowledge that Hadoop and similar frameworks are essential when data volume exceeds the capacity of a single machine or when the data is already stored in a distributed manner (e.g., in cloud object storage like S3). The trade-off is between the overhead of a distributed system and the ability to process data that is too large for one machine. The conversation concludes that the key is to understand the problem's scale and choose the simplest, most efficient tool that meets the requirements, rather than defaulting to the most complex or popular solution.

## [A Social Filesystem](https://overreacted.io/a-social-filesystem/)
**Score:** 312 | **Comments:** 145 | **ID:** 46665839

> **Article:** The article "A Social Filesystem" by Dan Abramov (overreacted.io) presents the AT Protocol (Bluesky's underlying technology) through the metaphor of a filesystem. It explains that a user's data (posts, likes, profiles) is stored in a Personal Data Server (PDS), which functions like a directory on a computer. The protocol allows different applications to read and write to this "filesystem" using standardized schemas called Lexicons. The author argues that this architecture decouples the data from the application, allowing users to own their social graph and content while enabling interoperability between different apps, similar to how files can be opened by different programs on a personal computer.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revealed a mix of enthusiasm for decentralized protocols and skepticism regarding the specific implementation and corporate backing of the AT Protocol.

A significant portion of the debate focused on the feasibility and accessibility of self-hosting. One commenter argued that true decentralization requires a "plug-and-play" home server solution for non-technical users, dismissing current efforts as merely shifting control between large organizations. However, others countered that Bluesky's Personal Data Servers (PDS) are already available and easy to set up, citing tools like PDSmoover for data migration. The author, Dan Abramov, clarified that hosting user data is actually cheap, shifting the cost burden to processing (like video), which is necessary regardless of where data is stored.

Technical architecture was another key topic. Some users critiqued the AT Protocol as "over-engineered" or "goofy" in its hierarchy, suggesting a flatter, hash-based structure similar to Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) would be more robust. Others drew comparisons to existing projects like Solid (Tim Berners-Lee's project) and remoteStorage. The author distinguished AT Protocol by its focus on aggregating public data first—essential for social media—whereas Solid focuses primarily on private data.

Finally, the conversation touched on the broader movement toward "local-first" and humane web software. While some expressed optimism about these shifts away from "enshittification," others remained cynical about the corporate incentives behind protocols like AT, worrying about potential future monetization or walled gardens. Practical concerns about data permanence and privacy were also raised, noting that public data on a PDS is effectively permanent and replicated across the network.

## [The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 216 | **ID:** 46669404

> **Article:** The article is a press release from the Nobel Peace Prize organization stating that the prize and the laureate are inseparable. It clarifies that the physical medal and diploma are awarded to the individual and cannot be sold, transferred, or owned by third parties. The statement emphasizes that the prize is a personal honor, not a commodity, and that the organization does not recognize any transfer of ownership or "secondary awards" of the prize.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely dismisses the press release as unnecessary or performative, with many commenters viewing it as a reaction to recent controversies rather than a fundamental principle. The conversation quickly pivots to mocking the current political climate, specifically targeting Donald Trump's acceptance of a "secondary" Nobel Peace Prize from a separate organization. Commenters use sarcasm and analogies—such as Usain Bolt giving away a gold medal—to highlight the absurdity of the situation, suggesting the press release is a futile attempt to maintain institutional integrity in the face of political theater.

Beyond the immediate controversy, there is a broader critique of the Nobel Peace Prize itself. Many users argue that unlike the scientific prizes, the Peace Prize is inherently politicized, historically controversial (citing examples like Henry Kissinger and Barack Obama), and lacks the same prestige. The discussion also touches on the technicalities of prize ownership, with references to Oscar statues and James Watson's Nobel medal, though these are mostly used to underscore the current absurdity rather than debate legalities. Overall, the sentiment is cynical, viewing the press release as a thin-veiled response to a "thin-skinned" leader and questioning the relevance of the Peace Prize in general.

## [Police Invested Millions in Shadowy Phone-Tracking Software Won't Say How Used](https://www.texasobserver.org/texas-police-invest-tangles-sheriff-surveillance/)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46672150

> **Article:** The Texas Observer article investigates Texas law enforcement agencies' significant investment in "Tangles," a shadowy phone-tracking software. The software, provided by a company called Matrix, allows police to track individuals' locations in real-time by accessing data from various sources, including the "dark web." The central issue highlighted is the lack of transparency: despite spending millions in public funds, police departments refuse to disclose how, when, or why they use this powerful surveillance tool, citing the need to protect investigative methods. The article suggests this software enables warrantless tracking, effectively bypassing traditional legal oversight by using purchased data as a pretext to establish probable cause.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a multifaceted debate centered on privacy, legality, and the effectiveness of such surveillance tools. A primary theme is the legal and ethical ambiguity of the software. Commenters debate whether purchasing location data from third parties constitutes a "search" under the Fourth Amendment, with some arguing it's a loophole that bypasses warrant requirements, while others contend the beef should be with data brokers selling the information, not the police buying it. The concept of "parallel construction"—using illicitly obtained data to build a legal case through other means—was frequently mentioned as a likely operational model.

Another major theme is the perceived futility of protest against the surveillance state. Several users expressed pessimism, viewing this as part of an inevitable trend toward 24/7 control by the powerful, where technological superiority makes dissent impossible. There was also criticism of the article's framing; some users felt the specific example used in the original piece was weak and that the software was being criticized for the wrong reasons (e.g., wasting taxpayer money rather than being inherently dangerous). Finally, a minority of commenters defended the utility of such tools for law enforcement, citing their effectiveness in high-profile cases like the Capitol riots, creating a tension between security and civil liberties.

## [Flux 2 Klein pure C inference](https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46670279

> **Article:** Salvatore "antirez" Sanfilippo (creator of Redis) announced a new project, `flux2.c`, which is a pure C implementation of the inference pipeline for the Flux.2 Klein image generation model. The project was developed using the AI coding assistant Opus 4.5, guided by a detailed specification file (`IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`) that was continuously updated throughout the process. The goal is to provide a minimal, dependency-free C library for embedding image generation capabilities into applications like game engines or Photoshop, moving away from the traditional Python-heavy AI stack to make open models more accessible.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on three main themes: the viability of AI-assisted coding for complex systems, the practical implications of the project, and best practices for "vibe coding."

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the process of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation and translation. The original author detailed his method of using a persistent, updated specification file to guide the AI, a technique others confirmed as effective. Commenters shared their own experiences, noting that while LLMs can produce massive speedups in tasks like transpiling code (e.g., to Rust), the output often requires careful review, especially for complex logic or mathematics. A key point was the suggestion that using one model to audit the code generated by another can be a highly effective peer-review strategy. There was also a debate on the quality of AI-generated code, with some arguing it's often suboptimal for maintenance, while others contended that modern models, when properly guided, can produce idiomatic, high-quality code.

Regarding the project itself, users were curious about its performance and legal standing. The author clarified that the C implementation is currently slower than Python-based alternatives (which use C/C++ backends) because it uses float32-only kernels, but its value lies in its simplicity and embeddability, not raw speed. A licensing question was raised about the use of an MIT license for a project based on Apache-licensed reference code, which the author addressed by noting that his implementation is a ground-up rewrite of the core inference logic, not a direct copy. The project's potential was seen as significant, with one commenter suggesting that such AI-assisted development could lead to faster-moving forks of major projects like `llama.cpp`.

Finally, several developers offered practical advice for others attempting similar large-scale coding tasks with AI, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a "spec" file and an "experiment log" to track changes and surprising turns in the development process.

## [ThinkNext Design](https://thinknextdesign.com/home.html)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46665310

> **Article:** The link directs to "ThinkNext Design," a website that appears to be a portfolio or showcase for a designer named David. The site features a collection of product designs, including the iconic IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad laptops, the AS/400 computer, and the Precision Wireless Travel Mouse. The content focuses on the visual aesthetics and design history of these products.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the enduring legacy and current state of ThinkPad laptops, with users expressing a mix of nostalgia for older models and frustration with modern Lenovo iterations.

A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the physical design and durability of ThinkPads. Many users champion older models for their reliability, citing long lifespans and using them as servers ("ThinkStack"). There is a strong preference among enthusiasts for the classic, non-metallic (plastic) chassis and the traditional keyboard, with some arguing that a metal casing would be a deal-breaker. However, others report issues with plastic warping in specific models like the T540p. Conversely, some users express a desire for larger screens (16 inches) or modern features like metal cases, indicating a split in the user base.

Performance and usability in modern contexts are also key topics. Users share positive experiences with newer models like the T14 (AMD) running Linux smoothly, but significant complaints arise regarding sleep mode functionality on Linux, which can brick Wi-Fi or the system itself. Battery life and reliability are also mentioned, with one user noting their 8-year-old laptop only recently needed a battery replacement, while another describes a nightmare experience with a dead out-of-warranty battery.

Finally, the discussion touches on specific accessories and the brand's direction. The "Precision Wireless Travel Mouse" is criticized for being laggy and uninnovative, despite its name. There is a sentiment that Lenovo is "riding the brand to destruction," leading some users to abandon new purchases in favor of sourcing tested, 2-3 year old units to maintain the classic ThinkPad experience.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, UK](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/aktuelles/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-2403016)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46669945

> **Article:** The linked article is a joint statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The statement expresses deep concern over the United States' recent imposition of tariffs on European goods. The European nations argue that these tariffs are unjustified, violate international trade rules, and will harm the economies of both the US and Europe. They call for dialogue and a return to a rules-based international trading system, emphasizing their commitment to a strong transatlantic partnership while firmly defending their own economic interests.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly moved beyond the specific content of the statement to a broader and more heated debate about US foreign policy, trade, and the reliability of its alliances under the Trump administration. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A significant portion of the discussion was dominated by speculation and alarm regarding the US potentially using military force to acquire Greenland. Several commenters expressed genuine fear that this was a real possibility, linking it to a perceived breakdown of international norms and the stability of the US government. This led to discussions about the logistical feasibility of such an invasion, the potential for internal dissent within the US military, and even hypothetical scenarios involving a conflict between the US and Canada.

Another major thread focused on the economic justifications for the US tariffs. One commenter presented a detailed argument, common in US trade disputes, that European Value-Added Taxes (VAT) and non-tariff barriers create an unfair playing field, using the high price of Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Denmark as a prime example. This sparked a counter-argument that the US should use established international bodies like the WTO to resolve disputes rather than acting unilaterally.

Finally, there was a recurring sentiment, expressed by both American and European commenters, of deep pessimism about the current political trajectory. An American citizen voiced a feeling of helplessness and a desire to take meaningful action against the administration's policies. European commenters expressed a lack of faith in their own continent's ability to mount a credible military or political response to US aggression, suggesting that such a response would be slow and ineffective. The overall tone was one of significant anxiety about the future of the transatlantic alliance and the stability of the international order.

## [Prediction markets are ushering in a world in which news becomes about gambling](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/america-is-slow-walking-into-a-polymarket-disaster/ar-AA1Upfdb)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 189 | **ID:** 46670524

> **Article:** The article argues that the mainstream promotion of prediction markets like Polymarket is "slow-walking" society into a disaster where news coverage becomes indistinguishable from gambling commentary. It posits that these platforms are inherently vulnerable to manipulation by wealthy actors who can afford to sway market odds, thereby influencing public perception reported by the media. The author contrasts the perceived dangers of these markets with the utility of traditional polling, suggesting that while prediction markets can be accurate, their susceptibility to gaming and their framing as newsworthy events corrupts the information ecosystem. The piece frames this trend as a modern iteration of historical manias, where financial speculation overtakes productive enterprise.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharp divide between those who view prediction markets as valuable informational tools and those who see them as dangerous, manipulable gambling platforms. A significant portion of the debate centers on the mechanics of market manipulation: skeptics argue that low trading volumes make Polymarket easy to game for those with capital, allowing them to manufacture news headlines cheaply, while proponents contend that any manipulation attempt creates profitable arbitrage opportunities for informed traders, eventually correcting the price.

Several users contextualized the issue through historical and philosophical lenses. One commenter drew a parallel to the monetary debasement in Revolutionary France, quoting a 19th-century historian to argue that rampant speculation and currency inflation lead to moral decay and economic stagnation. Another invoked Chesterton’s Fence, suggesting that the recent rush to embrace gambling technologies ignores the long-standing wisdom behind previous gambling restrictions.

Regarding the specific utility of these markets, opinions varied. Some defended them as superior to polls for predicting outcomes like elections, while others pointed to specific failures (e.g., the NYC mayoral race) to argue they are unreliable "trash platforms." There was also a semantic debate over whether these platforms are "prediction markets" or simply "corporatized bookies," with concerns raised that the democratization of high-risk financial instruments (like naked options) via user-friendly apps poses significant risks to the average consumer.

## [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46666283

> **Article:** The article links to "Consent-O-Matic," a browser extension designed to automate the dismissal of GDPR consent pop-ups. Unlike extensions that simply hide the banners or automatically click "Accept All," this tool attempts to navigate the cookie preference menus to select "Reject All" or granular privacy settings, thereby enforcing the user's privacy preferences automatically on supported websites.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the concept of automating cookie consent but debated the best tools and approaches. Several users noted that uBlock Origin's "cookie notices" filter list offers a simpler, platform-agnostic alternative, though some warned that it can break website functionality. A key distinction raised was that Consent-O-Matic attempts to actively reject tracking, whereas extensions like "I don't care about cookies" often default to accepting cookies to make banners disappear, potentially compromising privacy.

Discussion also touched on the broader annoyance of GDPR pop-ups. Users expressed frustration that many sites implement these banners incorrectly or unnecessarily, turning legal compliance into "consent theater" where users mindlessly click to dismiss. While some praised the extension for improving quality of life, others reported mixed results, noting that pop-ups still appear or that the extension occasionally breaks site functionality. The conversation concluded with a reminder that while cookie management helps, it does not fully mitigate browser fingerprinting.

## [Software engineers can no longer neglect their soft skills](https://www.qu8n.com/posts/most-important-software-engineering-skill-2026)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 211 | **ID:** 46667572

> **Article:** The article argues that in the coming years, soft skills—such as communication, business impact, and project management—will become the most critical abilities for software engineers. It posits that as AI tools automate more routine coding tasks, the value of pure technical implementation will diminish. Consequently, engineers will need to distinguish themselves through their ability to collaborate, understand business context, and effectively communicate complex ideas to stakeholders. The author suggests that these skills, previously associated with senior-level roles, will soon be essential even for junior developers to remain relevant and valuable in the industry.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News reveals a complex and often skeptical reaction to the article's premise. While many commenters agree that soft skills have always been important, there is significant debate about whether this is a new requirement or a timeless truth. A central theme is the impact of AI on the profession, with some arguing it will simply filter out those who lack genuine engineering aptitude, while others worry it will disproportionately affect neurodivergent individuals who found a haven in the more solitary aspects of coding.

Several key points emerged:
*   **Universities and AI:** A top comment highlights the irony that universities are struggling to teach writing skills due to AI-powered cheating, which undermines the very soft skills the article champions.
*   **The "Sinking Ship" Analogy:** One prominent commenter dismissed the advice as a desperate pivot, comparing it to telling truckers to "learn to code" in 2016. They argued that individual adaptation is a temporary fix for a systemic problem and that eventual mass displacement will require solutions like Universal Basic Income (UBI).
*   **Shift from Tarpit to Unemployment:** A recurring idea is that while poor soft skills were previously a "career tarpit" limiting advancement, they will soon be a reason for outright unemployment. The role of a developer who simply implements pre-scoped tickets is seen as highly vulnerable to automation.
*   **Stereotypes vs. Reality:** Some commenters challenged the "antisocial coder" stereotype, suggesting the new generation of engineers is more socially adept. However, others countered that the profession's history is rooted in providing a place for those with niche interests.
*   **Cynicism and Gatekeeping:** A cynical view emerged that "soft skills" can sometimes be a euphemism for corporate politics or sociopathy. There was also a sentiment that the ability to neglect soft skills was always reserved for "generational talent" outliers, and for most, it was already a career limitation.
*   **Counterarguments:** A few dissenting voices pointed out that technology often augments rather than replaces professions (e.g., calculators and accountants), though this was quickly countered by the historical example of "human computers" being replaced by electronic ones.

## [A free and open-source rootkit for Linux](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1053099/19c2e8180aeb0438/)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46666288

> **Article:** The linked LWN article discusses "Singularity," a free and open-source Linux kernel rootkit. It details the technical mechanisms the rootkit uses to achieve persistence and stealth, such as hooking kernel functions via Ftrace to hide files and processes, disable security features, and allow remote code execution. The article analyzes the code and its implementation, noting that the rootkit is designed to be difficult to detect and remove, even enabling Ftrace if an administrator attempts to disable it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the technical implications of the rootkit, the ethics of open-sourcing such tools, and practical applications of the underlying techniques.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the technical details, specifically the rootkit's use of Ftrace. One user asked if the kernel could be compiled with Ftrace support entirely removed to mitigate such threats, to which another user confirmed it is possible by configuring the kernel without `CONFIG_FTRACE`.

Regarding the open-source release, opinions were mixed. Some users argued that releasing the code is beneficial for defenders and security researchers, noting that open-source rootkits have existed for a long time and this doesn't significantly change the threat landscape. Others expressed concern about making such tools accessible to "imbeciles" or malicious actors, though this was countered by the point that the code serves an educational purpose.

Several comments focused on the MIT license chosen for the project. One user humorously lamented that the license doesn't force criminals to distribute the source code, joking that using it for nefarious purposes is a crime but not copyright infringement (though another user pointed out that failing to provide attribution is still a violation).

Finally, a user attempted to pivot the discussion toward a practical use case, asking for advice on hooking the VFS to remap file paths for forcing custom TLS certificates on specific applications. Other commenters suggested more standard, less invasive solutions like using mount namespaces, `chroot`, or `LD_PRELOAD` to achieve the same goal without modifying kernel internals.

## [What is Plan 9?](https://fqa.9front.org/fqa0.html#0.1)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46667675

> **Article:** The linked article is the "Plan 9 Frequently Questioned Answers" (FQA), a community-maintained FAQ for the Plan 9 operating system. It serves as a guide to understanding Plan 9's design philosophy, history, and technical details, addressing common questions from newcomers. The document explains Plan 9's origins at Bell Labs as a successor to Unix, emphasizing its core principles like "everything is a file," distributed computing, and a clean, simple design. It covers topics such as the system's architecture, its unique approach to networking and user interfaces, and how it differs from traditional Unix-like systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community with a deep appreciation for Plan 9's philosophy, while also being pragmatic about its limitations and place in the modern world.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on Plan 9's influence and practical applications. Users point out that its 9P network protocol is not just a historical artifact but is actively used in modern systems, citing its implementation in Linux (v9fs) and its role in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for accessing the host filesystem. This highlights Plan 9's enduring legacy as a source of practical, elegant solutions.

The discussion also explores the tension between Plan 9's simplicity and the complexity of modern programming languages. One user expresses a desire for Rust implementations, but others counter that Plan 9's native C dialect is intentionally simple and well-suited for an OS research environment. A commenter notes that returning to Plan 9's simplicity from languages like C++ or Swift feels like "therapy," suggesting that "modern" doesn't have to mean "complex."

Several comments touch on Plan 9's current status and usability. It's noted that the 9front fork is actively developed, with a conference planned, confirming the OS is "still alive and kicking." However, practical challenges remain; one user shares their experience using 9front for fun but acknowledges that the lack of a modern browser and video acceleration are significant blockers for desktop use.

Finally, the discussion delves into broader OS design philosophy. The "everything is a file" concept is debated, with one user questioning its relevance in an era of web APIs and SQL databases, while another argues it's precisely this abstraction that enables avoiding such technologies. The conversation also touches on the evolution from Plan 9 to Inferno and the influence of the Limbo language on Go, placing Plan 9 in a historical context as a transitional step between Unix and more modern distributed systems.

## [Sins of the Children](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/07/sins-of-the-children)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46669663

> **Article:** The article "Sins of the Children" is a short story by Adrian Tchaikovsky published in *Asterisk Magazine*. It is set in the same universe as his novel *Shroud*, featuring the same ship and characters. The narrative explores themes of corporate exploitation and ecological destruction, depicting a scenario where humanity encounters a unique, single-species ecosystem. The story serves as a critique of relentless resource pursuit and the failure to understand delicate alien environments, a recurring theme in Tchaikovsky's work.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly centered on the works of Adrian Tchaikovsky, with commenters using the article as a springboard to recommend his various novels and series. The key themes of the conversation are:

*   **Author Appreciation and Recommendations:** Tchaikovsky is lauded for his hard science fiction, incredible world-building, and ability to create truly alien intelligences. Several of his series are highlighted:
    *   The *Children of Time* series is frequently mentioned, with one user calling it their favorite book ever and praising its depiction of alien life.
    *   The *Tyrant Philosophers* series (including *City of Last Chances*) is praised for its absurdist, Pythonesque humor and its compelling exploration of colonization and cultural destruction.
    *   His standalone novels *Shroud* and *Alien Clay* are also recommended for their unique concepts of alien biology and cooperative life forms.

*   **Thematic Analysis of Sci-Fi:** A significant sub-discussion, sparked by a comment from "arjie," questions the prevalence of a specific moral theme in modern English science fiction: "humanity as the destructive bad guys." This user contrasts Tchaikovsky's work (and *Avatar*) with stories like *The Three Body Problem* and *The Wandering Earth*, where humanity is not the central moral agent or is just one participant among many in a larger cosmic play. Other users contribute recommendations for sci-fi that explores this different perspective, such as Kim Stanley Robinson's *Aurora* and Dan Simmons' *Hyperion Cantos*.

*   **Specific Story Context:** Users familiar with Tchaikovsky's work discuss the short story's place within the *Shroud* universe, speculating on its chronology and connecting characters mentioned in the story to the novel.

*   **Broader Sci-Fi Recommendations:** Beyond Tchaikovsky, other works are suggested for their exploration of alien intelligence and psychology, most notably Peter Watts' *Blindsight*.

## [Dead Internet Theory](https://kudmitry.com/articles/dead-internet-theory/)
**Score:** 126 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46671731

> **Article:** The article explores the "Dead Internet Theory," a conspiracy theory suggesting that the internet has been taken over by bots and AI-generated content, rendering human interaction a minority. The author, Dmitry K., examines the theory's origins and its increasing plausibility in the age of large language models (LLMs). The piece argues that while the theory is an extreme hypothesis, it reflects a genuine anxiety about the degradation of online spaces. It points to the proliferation of AI-generated "slop," the economic incentives for platforms to favor automated engagement, and the erosion of trust in online communication. The article uses examples like repetitive phrasing and stylistic tics (e.g., em-dashes) that are now common in both AI and human writing, blurring the lines between authentic and artificial content. Ultimately, it frames the theory as a cultural symptom of our struggle to navigate an internet saturated with non-human actors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the core anxieties of the Dead Internet Theory, even if users don't fully subscribe to the conspiracy. The conversation centers on the practical, observable effects of AI and bot proliferation on online communities and trust.

A key theme is the difficulty of distinguishing human from AI-generated text. Commenters debate linguistic markers like the use of em-dashes or specific phrases, noting that these features are now ambiguous—present in both LLM output and the writing styles of certain humans. This leads to a broader point about how text-based communication inherently lends a false sense of authority to content, making it easier for AI to deceive us.

Several users focus on the economic and platform-level drivers of this phenomenon. Reddit is cited as a prime example, where business incentives (like post-IPO revenue goals) are believed to encourage bot activity and repetitive, low-quality content. The removal of third-party API tools is seen as a move that harmed human moderators and inadvertently aided the spread of bots.

The discussion also explores potential futures for human interaction online. The "Dark Forest" theory is mentioned as a more nuanced alternative to the "dead" internet, suggesting that human communities will become hidden, invite-only "pockets" of authenticity in a sea of AI slop. This idea is tied to a sense of impending "enshittification," where innovation is stifled and access is paywalled, leaving only raw, human-driven interaction to exist in private or obscure corners of the web.

## [Starting from scratch: Training a 30M Topological Transformer](https://www.tuned.org.uk/posts/013_the_topological_transformer_training_tauformer)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46666963

> **Article:** The article details the training process and architecture of "Tauformer," a 30 million parameter transformer model that replaces standard attention with a topology-based mechanism. Instead of computing dot-product attention, the model uses a fixed graph Laplacian matrix to map token embeddings into a linear attention space based on scalar distances. The author presents this as a method to reduce memory usage and computational cost (specifically KV cache size) while attempting to maintain model quality, framing it as an experiment in "local topology" versus the "global geometry" of standard transformers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the architectural trade-offs, scalability, and validation of the proposed model. Commenters are generally skeptical but engaged with the underlying theory.

Key points of debate include:
*   **Scalability and "Cheating":** Several users noted that the model relies on a large, fixed (non-learned) graph Laplacian matrix to handle token relationships. While this keeps the learned parameter count low, critics argue that scaling this up for larger models would require the matrix itself to grow or be trained, potentially negating the efficiency benefits and making it resemble a conventional transformer.
*   **Benchmarks and Validation:** There was a notable lack of direct comparison to vanilla transformers of similar size or FLOP budgets. Users suggested that to prove the concept, researchers should swap this attention mechanism into existing large models (like the QRWKV example cited) rather than training small models from scratch, as performance differences at 30M parameters may not translate to 30B.
*   **Theoretical Interpretation:** Commenters attempted to explain the architecture in lay terms. The core idea is replacing high-dimensional dot-product attention with 1D scalar distances derived from topology, which theoretically saves compute. However, there was disagreement on whether this "topology" metaphor (hills and valleys vs. flat space) was instructive or just confusing.
*   **Alternative Tokenization:** A sub-thread emerged regarding tokenization strategies, with users discussing the potential of using continuous embeddings or byte-level encoders to capture more nuance than discrete tokens, though this was distinct from the main article's focus on attention mechanisms.
