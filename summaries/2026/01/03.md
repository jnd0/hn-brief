# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-03

## [I'm a developer for a major food delivery app](https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/)
**Score:** 576 | **Comments:** 276 | **ID:** 46461563

> **Article:** The article is a purported confession from a developer at a major food delivery app, posted on Reddit's r/confession. The developer claims that the company deliberately manipulates the user interface to mislead customers about the allocation of tips. Specifically, the developer alleges that the app's "Leave a tip for your driver" prompt is a dark pattern designed to make users believe the tip goes directly to the driver. In reality, the developer claims the company uses these tips to subsidize the driver's base pay, effectively paying the driver the same amount whether the customer tips or not, and pocketing the tip money as profit. The author expresses disillusionment with the industry's ethics and states they have resigned from their position.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the confession, primarily due to the lack of evidence. Many commenters point out that the post could be fabricated, noting that the author's claim of having just quit could be a "tactical misstep" or a fictional detail to add drama. The consensus is that while the alleged behavior is entirely plausible and fits the "techbro/VC playbook," a single anonymous Reddit post is not credible proof.

However, the discussion uses the confession as a springboard to debate broader issues with the gig economy. Several themes emerge:
*   **Systemic Distrust:** Commenters express a general lack of trust in these platforms. One user states they only tip in cash, questioning why anyone would trust a company to pass on tips if they already doubt its wage policies.
*   **Industry Viability:** The post is seen by some as more evidence that these business models are unsustainable and rely on an "infinite supply of suckers" willing to work as drivers for wages that are no longer competitive.
*   **Broader Company Malpractice:** Beyond tip theft, commenters share other negative experiences, such as inflated menu prices compared to ordering directly, and apps blaming restaurants for delays that are actually caused by a lack of available drivers.
*   **Competition and Alternatives:** A point of debate is whether users can simply switch to a competitor. The prevailing view is that the entire industry likely employs similar unethical practices, leaving consumers with no better alternative.

## [HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820)
**Score:** 506 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46463315

> **Article:** An article in *Eurosurveillance* reports on the dramatic success of the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. The data shows that the prevalence of the two most oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18) has been reduced from 16% in the pre-vaccination era to less than 1% in vaccinated women. This has led to a massive decline in cervical cancer rates, with Denmark nearing the WHO's threshold for eliminating the disease. The article also notes that while the targeted strains have been nearly eliminated, about one-third of women still have infections with other high-risk HPV types not covered by the current vaccine.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely celebrates the Danish program as a major public health success, with commenters providing further context on cervical cancer rates and the importance of digital health infrastructure for tracking such outcomes. However, the conversation quickly expands into several complex and contentious areas.

A significant portion of the debate revolves around the vaccine's benefits and messaging for men. One commenter argues that public health messaging has failed men by focusing on female-specific cancers, when the vaccine also prevents penile, rectal, and nasopharyngeal cancers in men. This point is complicated by another user's note on the inconsistent and costly access to the vaccine for men over 26 in many countries. The discussion also touches on the emergence of non-vaccine HPV strains, with users expressing hope for future, broader vaccines.

The thread also features a detailed sub-discussion on vaccine skepticism. One user's comment about a "hidden" post criticizing the vaccine is met with a rebuttal that the post was misleadingly edited and omitted key data to create a negative narrative. This rebuttal, however, concedes that public health agencies' poor communication about legitimate complexities (like the vaccine's effect on pre-existing infections) creates openings for anti-vaccine messaging. Other users add context on the vaccine's effectiveness even for those who are already sexually active and clarify the high prevalence of HPV.

## [FracturedJson](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki)
**Score:** 506 | **Comments:** 138 | **ID:** 46464235

> **Article:** FracturedJson is a tool and library for formatting JSON data into a more readable, two-dimensional "table-like" layout. It aims to improve the readability of complex JSON by aligning keys and values in columns, similar to how some code formatters can structure data. The project includes implementations in C# and TypeScript/JavaScript, as well as a command-line interface (CLI) that can read from standard input and write to standard output, making it suitable for use in command-line pipelines.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion around FracturedJson centered on several key themes:

*   **The Debate Over Comments in JSON:** A primary topic was the long-standing debate about JSON's lack of comment support. One user praised FracturedJson for supporting comments, calling the original reason for their exclusion "silly." However, others defended the decision, arguing that it was a deliberate design choice by Douglas Crockford to prevent JSON from becoming as complex and misused as XML, citing Hyrum's Law (if a feature can be misused, it will be).

*   **Practical Use Cases and Limitations:** Commenters identified potential uses, such as for debug output in APIs or game development. However, there was a strong consensus that it should not be used for human-written configuration files, for which TOML or YAML are considered superior. A significant practical concern raised was that the formatting could be problematic for version control `diff`s, as minor data changes could cause large reformatting shifts.

*   **Tooling and Integration:** Many users immediately thought of integrating FracturedJson with `jq`, a popular command-line JSON processor. The discussion confirmed that the CLI tool supports piping, making this a natural fit. There was also a call for broader integration into standard JSON libraries and tools.

*   **Implementation and Standardization:** One commenter noted the existence of multiple, separate implementations (C#, TypeScript) and proposed the creation of a language-independent conformance test suite to ensure consistent behavior across all versions, which would facilitate porting the tool to other languages.

*   **Alternatives and Comparisons:** Some users discussed alternative ways to achieve readability, such as embedding comments as string values within the JSON structure itself. Others compared the concept to custom XML formatters they had built in the past. A speculative use case was also mentioned: the potential for token efficiency when used with Large Language Models (LLMs), though it was noted that minified JSON would be even more token-efficient.

## [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
**Score:** 437 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46463644

> **Article:** The article "10 years of personal finances in plain text files" details the author's long-term use of a plain-text accounting system, specifically Beancount, to manage their money. The author advocates for this method over traditional budgeting apps, highlighting its benefits: data ownership and portability (files are simple text), powerful search and analysis capabilities (using standard command-line tools or custom scripts), and extreme flexibility to track not just bank transactions but also investments, RSUs, and other assets. The post outlines the author's workflow, which involves a consistent directory structure (one file per year), automated importers to parse bank statements, and a monthly time commitment of 30-45 minutes for reconciliation. The author concludes that while there is an initial learning curve, the long-term benefits of having a complete, queryable, and future-proof financial record are immense.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely validated the author's approach, with many users sharing their own positive, long-term experiences with plain-text accounting tools like Beancount, hledger, and ledger-cli. The discussion revolved around several key themes:

*   **The Power and Flexibility of the System:** Users celebrated the ability of plain-text systems to track a holistic financial picture, far beyond what commercial apps offer. They mentioned tracking investments, pensions, RSUs, and even non-traditional assets like electricity usage (kWh). The use of version control (git) for history, auditing, and syncing was also highlighted as a major advantage.

*   **The Learning Curve and Niche Appeal:** A prominent counterpoint was that this method is not for everyone. The barrier to entry is significant, requiring an understanding of double-entry bookkeeping and comfort with command-line tools and text editors. It was widely agreed that this is a niche solution for developers and technical users who value control and data ownership over user-friendliness.

*   **Time Investment and Value:** The original article's mention of spending 30-45 minutes per month prompted debate. Some saw this as a significant time cost, while others argued it was a small price to pay for financial clarity and control, especially when compared to the time people spend on less productive activities.

*   **Community, Tools, and Workflows:** Participants shared practical advice and tools. Fava was frequently recommended as an essential GUI frontend for Beancount that makes viewing and editing data much easier. The discussion also touched on the challenges of initial setup, such as importing historical data and creating robust importers for bank statements. The use of LLMs to help build custom tooling was a novel point raised by one user.

## [39th Chaos Communication Congress Videos](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2025)
**Score:** 374 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46464426

> **Article:** The article links to the video archive for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39c3), a major annual hacker conference held in Hamburg, Germany. The media portal hosts recordings of all talks, covering a wide range of topics including cybersecurity, hardware hacking, privacy, policy, and digital culture. The link provides access to the full library of presentations from the 2025 event.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around specific talks and the overall theme of the conference. Cory Doctorow's talk on "a post-American enshittification-resistant internet" is a major highlight, with users sharing links to the video and a transcript. The excerpt shared details a story about how the US used trade leverage (threats to coffee markets) to force other nations to adopt anti-circumvention laws, a point that resonated strongly with the audience.

Several other talks are frequently recommended by commenters, including technical deep dives into hacking GPG, Bluetooth headphone vulnerabilities, in-house electronics manufacturing, and escaping FreeBSD jails. There is also a notable discussion about the cancellation of a talk by AI researcher Joscha Bach following the public release of his private emails with Jeffrey Epstein, which led to a separate, unrecorded critical event at the congress.

The conversation also touches on the culture of the event itself. One user expressed a feeling that the conference is declining in technical quality, which was met with a list of counter-examples of highly technical talks. A minor debate emerged over a talk titled "selbstverständlich antifaschistisch!" (Obviously anti-fascist!), with one user labeling it "left-wing extremism," while others argued that antifascism is a core part of the hacker ethos, antithetical to the obedience and power structures that fascism demands. Finally, a small thread was dedicated to the "Maneki-neko" (waving cat) icon used in the video player, which was explained as a practical tool for streamers to detect frozen video feeds that became a conference mascot.

## [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 356 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article links to the IndieWeb concept of POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere). This is a strategy for owning your content by first posting it to a personal website you control, and then automatically or manually sharing ("syndicating") copies to various social media platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, or LinkedIn. This contrasts with the more common PESOS (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate to your Own Site) model, where content is created on third-party platforms and then imported. The core philosophy is to maintain ownership and a "single source of truth" while still engaging with audiences on the platforms where they reside.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a return to the original, decentralized ideals of the web. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Ownership and Control:** Many commenters championed POSSE as a way to reclaim ownership of their content and identity from large corporations. It was framed as a defense against platform lock-in, algorithmic manipulation, and the risk of losing one's audience if a platform declines or disappears. One user noted that major platforms often "down-rank" content that appears to be syndicated, highlighting the power struggle involved.

*   **Practical Implementation and Tools:** Several users shared their personal workflows. One commenter described their manual process of posting to their site and then syndicating to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter, expressing a desire to automate it. Another pointed to a tool called "Posse Party" that automates syndication from an RSS feed, though a warning was issued about its non-commercial license.

*   **Historical Context and Lost Potential:** A recurring sentiment was nostalgia for a more open web. One commenter lamented the failure of semantic web standards (like microformats and RSS) to create a truly distributed social graph, while another humorously pointed out that HN itself has operated on this principle for years (posting on HN and syndicating elsewhere).

*   **Counter-Perspectives:** Not all discussion was purely positive. One user argued that the desire for a decentralized web is a regression, suggesting people should focus more on offline, non-digital interactions. Another clarified that the core issue is about ownership and data sovereignty, not a reaction to LLMs or modern technology.

## [Parental controls aren't for parents](https://beasthacker.com/til/parental-controls-arent-for-parents.html)
**Score:** 348 | **Comments:** 364 | **ID:** 46464652

> **Article:** The article "Parental controls aren't for parents" argues that parental control software is intentionally designed to be difficult and ineffective, serving the business interests of tech companies rather than the needs of families. The author, a parent, details his frustrating experiences with various platforms. He claims that app store filters (like on Gabb) are misleading, allowing "safe" apps that still contain dangerous features like group chats. He describes the Nintendo Switch ecosystem as a confusing nightmare of conflicting accounts (Nintendo vs. Microsoft for Minecraft) and an inability to block free game downloads on the eShop, which he sees as a deliberate tactic to force parents into accepting a constant stream of new, unevaluated content. He concludes that the system is designed to "beat down" parents until they give up and become the "ideal customer" who pays for subscriptions and allows unrestricted access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide in how parents approach technology, centering on the balance between technical solutions and personal involvement. A primary theme is the critique of the original author's approach. Many commenters argue that his problems stem from a desire for a "set it and forget it" technical fix rather than active parenting. They point out that the warnings he complains about are clearly visible, that guides for Nintendo's parental controls are easy to find, and that his "beasthacker" persona is ironic for someone struggling with basic device management.

This leads to a broader debate on parenting philosophy. One side advocates for direct supervision, with one user stating their rule is that gaming is a family activity, never a solo one. However, this is immediately challenged by others who call this unrealistic for modern families where schoolwork and social life are deeply integrated with technology. A more nuanced view suggests that education and trust are more effective than restrictive controls, with parents teaching children how to handle online risks rather than trying to build an impenetrable wall.

Finally, there is significant agreement that the tech industry is actively hostile to parents. Users share frustrations with specific platforms like Disney+ (lacking per-show blocking), Hulu (bundling unwanted content), and Roblox (being a "minefield"). The consensus is that companies have no financial incentive to create effective, user-friendly parental controls, as they profit from unrestricted user engagement and data collection. The Nintendo Switch's clunky account system is cited as a prime example of this corporate negligence.

## [Standard Ebooks: Public Domain Day 2026 in Literature](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46462702

> **Article:** This article from Standard Ebooks announces the works that will enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2026. This includes all books published in 1930. The post highlights several notable titles from that year, such as Agatha Christie's *The Murder at the Vicarage*, Ernest Hemingway's *The Sun Also Rises*, and William Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying*. The article also showcases some of the beautiful cover art that Standard Ebooks has created for these new additions to their collection, which is a project dedicated to creating high-quality, modern ebooks from public domain texts.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the Standard Ebooks project for its high-quality formatting and curation. A contributor to the project is present and answers questions.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Appreciation for Quality and Curation:** Many commenters express gratitude for the project, noting they've discovered classic literature (like works by Chesterton and Sayers) through it. The quality of the ebooks and the aesthetic of the cover art are specifically praised.
*   **The Nature of Public Domain:** There is a significant sub-thread about the complexities of copyright law. Users point out that the article's "Public Domain Day" applies only to the US, and provide examples of how works can be in the public domain in one country (e.g., Canada) but not another (e.g., France, or even Canada after a law change). This highlights the legal messiness of digital access.
*   **The Future of Cultural Consumption:** One commenter posits a "cultural inflection point" where the growing volume of high-quality public domain works will become a more reliable source of culture than the constant stream of new, often low-quality, content (referred to as "AI slop"). This leads to a vision for a "Netflix-like" service for public domain media.
*   **Related Projects and Efforts:** The conversation also touches on related topics, including the difficulty of creating ebooks from physical copies (even with modern OCR), the murkiness of digital ownership for purchased ebooks, and a mention of a personal library management app that integrates Standard Ebooks.

## [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 541 | **ID:** 46465327

> **Article:** The article, published on the 30th anniversary of IPv6's specification, explores why the protocol has not fully replaced IPv4. It argues that while IPv6 has not "taken over the world" in the sense of making IPv4 obsolete, it has been a critical success by absorbing the massive growth in internet-connected devices, particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments. The piece suggests that IPv4's continued viability is a direct result of IPv6 handling this expansion, and that the two protocols will likely coexist for the foreseeable future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and often contentious divide between IPv6's large-scale success and its practical, on-the-ground experience for many users and administrators.

A central theme is the discrepancy between adoption statistics and individual experience. While some engineers report that over 75% of traffic in large enterprises is IPv6, many others, particularly in residential or self-hosting contexts, find it to be an afterthought. This is often due to ISPs failing to provide adequate support, such as static prefixes for residential customers or even basic functionality on some fiber connections. This lack of reliable ISP support is a major barrier to adoption.

The discussion also highlights significant practical hurdles. For self-hosters and gamers, a lack of native IPv6 support in many applications and services remains a problem, forcing them to maintain complex dual-stack configurations or rely on IPv4-only connections. The fear of breaking compatibility is a powerful deterrent.

A notable point of debate was privacy. One commenter argued that IPv6's direct addressability is a step backward for anonymity compared to the "casual anonymity" of IPv4 with NAT. However, this was widely countered by others who pointed out that ISPs can easily link a household to an IPv4 address, and that IPv6's privacy extensions are designed to mitigate device-level tracking. The consensus was that modern browser fingerprinting is a far greater privacy threat than the IP protocol version.

Finally, there is a sense of resignation and pragmatism. Many commenters believe that IPv4 is here to stay indefinitely, with some predicting it will become a commoditized asset that is leased or traded. The consensus is that while IPv6 is essential for the future growth of the internet (especially for mobile and IoT), the transition will be a slow, long-term process, not a sudden takeover.

## [Clicks Communicator](https://www.clicksphone.com/en/communicator)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46467057

> **Article:** The article links to the product page for "Clicks Communicator," a physical QWERTY keyboard case designed for modern smartphones. It aims to bring back the tactile typing experience of classic devices like the BlackBerry. The keyboard connects via USB-C (for iPhone) or Lightning (for Android) and includes a dedicated "Command" key for shortcuts. The product is marketed as a tool for productivity, allowing users to type faster and more accurately without looking, and as a way to reduce screen time by making typing more efficient.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is largely positive, with many users expressing nostalgia for physical keyboards, specifically citing BlackBerry and Palm Treo as devices they miss. There is a strong sentiment that on-screen keyboards remain inefficient, and this product offers a tangible solution for productivity and accuracy.

However, the discussion highlights several key themes and concerns:
*   **Productivity vs. Digital Detox:** While the product is marketed as a "second device" for focus, a prominent commenter argues this is a flawed strategy. They suggest Clicks should instead market it as a superior *main* device for professionals who value efficient input for tasks like writing emails and editing spreadsheets, arguing that the keyboard's main differentiator is productivity, not minimalism.
*   **Platform and OS Flexibility:** A significant portion of users are interested in using the keyboard with alternative operating systems like Linux or custom Android ROMs (e.g., GrapheneOS, LineageOS). A major point of contention is the lack of information on whether the bootloader is unlockable, which would be a prerequisite for such support.
*   **Hardware Limitations:** Some users note that the keyboard lacks essential keys for power users, such as Ctrl, arrow keys, and Page Up/Down, which limits its utility for tasks like coding or using the command line.
*   **Skepticism about "Innovation":** A few commenters are cynical, viewing the product as a simple accessory rather than true innovation, and question the premise of buying a new device just to avoid self-control on social media apps.

## [Daft Punk Easter Egg in the BPM Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?](https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46469577

> **Article:** An article on madebywindmill.com analyzes the tempo of Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger." By measuring the time between the first and last audible beats in the track (445 beats over 216.276 seconds), the author calculates a precise BPM of 123.45. The author posits that this highly specific, non-standard tempo is an intentional easter egg, thematically resonating with the song's lyrics about robotic efficiency and the band's "humanity" being processed by a machine.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of appreciation for the artistic interpretation and scrutiny of the underlying math. The most upvoted comment, by altairprime, expands on the article's theme, connecting the 123.45 BPM to the plot of the *Interstella 5555* movie, where the band is abducted and brainwashed to create robotic music. The commenter theorizes the tempo is what a non-musical manager would type into a field, making it a perfect thematic fit.

However, the technical details were also debated. User jonas21 corrected the author's calculation, arguing that the BPM should be rounded to 123.45 for the YouTube version. This prompted a "red string" style deep-dive from altairprime, who speculated on other beat and duration combinations that could yield the more "perfect" 123.4567 BPM, furthering the idea of a hidden numerical puzzle. Other users shared their own DAW-based measurements (finding 123.47 BPM) and pointed out that the original sample, "Cola Bottle Baby," has a different tempo. The discussion also branched into other Daft Punk easter eggs, the history of their name, and a technical aside about the timing precision challenges in electronic music production.

## [2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2026/year-linux-desktop/)
**Score:** 213 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46471199

> **Article:** The article, "2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop," is a personal manifesto detailing the author's decision to switch their daily driver operating system from Windows to Linux. The author expresses deep frustration with the current state of Windows, citing a decline in quality, intrusive features, and a general lack of respect for the user. Key criticisms include the increasing prevalence of ads and bloatware, the confusing and fragmented state of the user interface (UI) with multiple competing frameworks (Win32, UWP, WinUI), and the "enshittification" of core applications. The author contrasts this with the perceived benefits of the Linux ecosystem, such as user control, customization, transparency, and the absence of corporate-driven anti-features. The piece is framed as a final straw, where the negatives of staying on Windows now outweigh the perceived friction of switching to Linux, which has become significantly more viable for mainstream use thanks to projects like Steam's Proton for gaming.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive and supportive of the author's decision, reflecting a broader sentiment that Windows is in decline while Linux is reaching a new level of desktop maturity. The conversation can be grouped into several key themes:

A significant portion of the comments validates the article's premise with personal anecdotes. Many users share their own successful, long-term transitions to Linux, with some humorously referring to it as a "year of the Linux desktop" that started years or even decades ago, comparing the switch to quitting smoking.

There is a strong consensus on the specific grievances against Windows. Commenters heavily criticize the modern Windows UI, particularly the use of webviews and frameworks like React Native for core system components, which they see as a sign of poor engineering and a departure from native, responsive interfaces. Performance issues are also a major theme, with users reporting laggy file explorers and high memory usage, which they contrast with the snappiness and efficiency of Linux.

The discussion also highlights the factors making Linux a more practical choice today. Valve's work with Proton is repeatedly mentioned as a game-changer that has removed the final barrier for many would-be switchers (gaming). Furthermore, the need to replace aging hardware incompatible with Windows 11 is seen as a major catalyst pushing users toward Linux, as it can breathe new life into older machines.

Finally, the conversation addresses the remaining hurdles and the changing role of Microsoft. While some mention specific software gaps like Adobe Photoshop, many feel these are becoming less significant. The consensus is that Microsoft no longer prioritizes the consumer desktop market, instead focusing on enterprise revenue and monetizing users through ads and data, making the OS feel increasingly "hostile." The overall tone is one of a community witnessing a tipping point where Linux is no longer a niche choice for developers but a genuinely compelling alternative for everyday users.

**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46464120

> **Article:** The article "Assorted less(1) tips" is a collection of productivity tricks for the `less` command-line pager. Key tips include using `&` to filter lines with regexes, `s` to save the current content to a file, and `+F` to follow new output (similar to `tail -f`). It also covers useful command-line flags like `-R` (quit if content is smaller than the screen), `-X` (don't clear the screen on exit), and `-L` (ignore pre-processing, useful for log files). The post also mentions the `most` pager and `glow` for Markdown rendering.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expanded on the original article by highlighting several favorite features and alternatives. A major theme was the `+F` / `F` command for following file or pipe output, which many users prefer over `tail` because it allows for interactive searching and navigation. Users also shared their essential command-line flags, such as `-X` to preserve the screen contents after exiting and the combination `-SEXIER` for a preferred default configuration.

Several commenters mentioned the ability to save piped output to a file using the `s` key, which is useful for capturing long-running command outputs without pre-emptively using `tee`. The discussion also touched on customization via `~/.lesskey` (though noted as difficult on macOS) and mentioned modern alternatives like `ov`, `moor`, and a fork of `glow`. Finally, some users noted the intuitive overlap between `less` commands and standard Vim navigation.

## [Marmot – A distributed SQLite server with MySQL wire compatible interface](https://github.com/maxpert/marmot)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46460676

> **Article:** The article introduces Marmot, an open-source project that functions as a distributed SQLite server. It allows multiple applications to connect to a SQLite database as if it were a centralized server, providing scalability and high availability for a database typically known for its embedded, single-file nature. Marmot achieves this by implementing the MySQL wire protocol, ensuring compatibility with a vast ecosystem of existing applications, tools, and ORMs without requiring code changes. The project emphasizes its ability to replicate all database changes, including Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, across a cluster of nodes, making it a viable solution for scaling out applications like WordPress.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to Marmot, with users expressing excitement about its recent progress, particularly the addition of DDL replication. A key point of discussion was the project's architecture and roadmap. The author clarified that the current version replicates all databases to all nodes, but future plans include more granular control, such as selective replication and proxying writes from replicas, which would address sharding and routing for write scaling.

Several users shared positive real-world experiences, with one detailing its successful use in a high-traffic "Wayback Machine" style site to sync data across servers, and another praising its reliability. The project's use of the MySQL protocol was a central theme. One user questioned its advantages over traditional MySQL with active-active replication, while another, who personally prefers Postgres, acknowledged that Marmot makes a MySQL-based stack like WordPress hosting a much more attractive option.

Technical questions also arose, including how Marmot handles consistency with its "gossip protocol" (the author pointed to documentation on its limitations) and potential integrations with backup tools like Litestream. The author noted that Marmot already supports Debezium, which offers more powerful data streaming capabilities than simple backups. Overall, the discussion highlighted strong user validation and interest in Marmot's potential to solve scaling challenges for SQLite-based applications.

## [A confession from a mainstream food delivery app engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/gbrh2zxeou)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46461578

> **Article:** The article is an anonymous "confession" from a purported mainstream food delivery app engineer, posted on Reddit. The author claims that several features of these apps are deceptive. Specifically, they allege that "Priority Delivery" is a scam that does not actually speed up delivery, as the dispatch logic ignores the flag. They also claim the company's "tip stealing" model involves using customer tips to subsidize the driver's base pay, rather than directly increasing the driver's earnings. The author states they are posting from a burner device to avoid repercussions from their employer.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the confession's authenticity. A significant portion of the comments argue that the post is likely fabricated or "fake news." The primary reasons for this skepticism include the author's operational security choices, which commenters found contradictory (using a library Wi-Fi but providing specific details that could lead to doxxing), and the narrative style, which some felt sounded like a creative writing exercise or an AI-generated output.

Regarding the specific claims, the community debate focused heavily on the "Priority Delivery" feature. While the original post claimed it was a complete scam, several users countered with personal experiences, stating that it effectively prevented their orders from being bundled with others, thus resulting in faster, direct delivery. Other discussion points touched on the broader ethics of gig economy apps, with users sharing anecdotes about dynamic pricing and the general lack of trust in these unregulated platforms. The consensus leaned towards viewing the post as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility without evidence.

## [A small collection of text-only websites](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46463635

> **Article:** The article, "A small collection of text-only websites," curates a list of websites that prioritize content over presentation by offering minimalist, text-focused, or plain-text versions. Examples include Daring Fireball's `.text` view, NPR's text-only site, and the famously simple Berkshire Hathaway site. The author advocates for this approach as a way to improve accessibility, performance, and user experience for those who prefer uncluttered content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with users sharing additional examples and reflecting on the concept. A key theme was the proliferation of "lite" versions of major news sites, with commenters adding links to text-only alternatives for CNN and CBC. The conversation also touched on nostalgia for the early web, recalling the era of "printer-friendly" pages and how CNN's site went text-only to handle traffic on 9/11. Several technical approaches were discussed, such as serving content via `.json` or `.txt` extensions for power users and the use of older protocols like Gemini and Gopher. The discussion also highlighted specific examples of minimalist design, like Berkshire Hathaway's consistent, no-frills site, and the use of the `.text` extension on Daring Fireball, the blog of Markdown's creator. The conversation concluded with a debate on what constitutes a truly "text-only" site versus one that is merely "minimally styled."

## [FreeBSD: Home NAS, part 1 – configuring ZFS mirror (RAID1)](https://rtfm.co.ua/en/freebsd-home-nas-part-1-configuring-zfs-mirror-raid1/)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46462108

> **Article:** The article is a technical guide for setting up a home NAS using FreeBSD. It focuses specifically on configuring a ZFS mirror (equivalent to RAID1) for data redundancy. The author walks through the process step-by-step, starting from booting the FreeBSD installer, partitioning the disks, and creating the ZFS pool and datasets. The guide is aimed at users who want to build their own storage solution using the robust features of FreeBSD and ZFS.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with users expressing a strong appetite for more content related to FreeBSD, ZFS, and the built-in bhyve hypervisor. A key theme was the appeal of a FreeBSD-based stack for users seeking a powerful, open-source alternative to Linux that avoids systemd.

Several users highlighted the core benefits of ZFS, particularly its data integrity features. One commenter argued that ZFS's ability to report on hardware issues (like checksum errors or slow reads) provides superior operational insight compared to other systems. The discussion also clarified that while ZFS's copy-on-write mechanism is robust, it doesn't make memory errors less of a risk for any filesystem, though ZFS is better at detecting and reporting the resulting corruption. The convenience of ZFS snapshots for cheap, frequent backups and easy rollbacks was also a major point in its favor.

A standout contribution was a detailed explanation of ZFS Boot Environments, a feature that allows users to create a snapshot of their working system, apply updates or changes in an isolated environment, and then boot into it. If anything goes wrong, they can easily roll back to the previous known-good state, making system maintenance much safer.

For users less familiar with ZFS, there was a debate on its necessity for occasional home use. While some felt a simple hardware RAID and cloud backup was sufficient, others countered that ZFS's self-healing and diagnostic capabilities were worth the learning curve. The discussion also touched on alternatives like TrueNAS (now Linux-based), NixOS's system generations, and LibOSTree, which offer similar atomic update/rollback functionalities without relying on ZFS.

## [Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone](https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03)
**Score:** 127 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46466364

> **Article:** Punkt. has unveiled the MC03, a €700 smartphone that operates on a subscription model. The device requires a mandatory subscription (approximately €10/month) to maintain full functionality, including security updates and core privacy features. While the phone itself does not brick if the subscription lapses, access to these essential services is restricted. The company markets this as a privacy-first approach where users pay for the service rather than becoming the product, positioning it against ad-supported models from major tech giants.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with users expressing disbelief and frustration at the subscription model. The primary criticism centered on the concept of paying €700 for hardware that remains under the manufacturer's control, with many commenters viewing this as "Phone-as-a-Service" rather than true ownership. Several users pointed out the irony that a device marketed for privacy still requires trusting a third-party company with subscription management and service access.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on alternatives. Commenters mentioned GrapheneOS as a superior, more transparent option for privacy-conscious users, with some noting that Punkt's OS appears to be an outdated fork of GrapheneOS rather than the modern version. The discussion also highlighted broader trends toward self-hosted solutions, with one user describing their custom portable PBX setup using Raspberry Pi and 5G hotspots as a way to completely escape the "subscription device game."

Some users defended the subscription model conceptually, arguing that paying for OS development is more ethical than the hidden costs in "free" ad-supported platforms. However, even these defenders were skeptical of Punkt's specific implementation, questioning what exactly the subscription funds and whether it contributes back to upstream open-source projects. The consensus was that while the idea of paying for privacy has merit, Punkt's execution felt like "the same walls, different garden"—maintaining the same locked-down ecosystem while charging users for the privilege.

## [Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal](https://unixv4.dev/)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46468283

> **Article:** The article links to a website, `unixv4.dev`, which provides a live, interactive terminal session emulating a PDP-11 running the historic Unix v4 operating system from 1973. The site offers users a chance to experience this early version of Unix directly in their browser, serving as an educational and nostalgic demonstration of computing history.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, though significantly hampered by the "Hug of Death," with many users reporting rate limits and connection timeouts. The key themes of the conversation were:

*   **Security and Privacy Concerns:** A primary debate revolved around trust. Some users were wary of the service's privacy policy, which logs IP addresses and terminal sessions, and questioned the lack of open-source code to verify its security. Others countered that the threat model for a simple curiosity like an old OS emulator was negligible and it was "okay to have fun."

*   **Legality and Copyright:** The legality of hosting the software was questioned. However, a commenter clarified that Caldera International released Research Unix versions up to 7th edition under a permissive BSD-style license in 2002, making such a project legally viable.

*   **Technical Implementation and History:** The discussion touched on technical aspects, with one user linking to a blog post about a buffer overflow vulnerability in the original V4 code, sparking a conversation about the history of exploit awareness. There was also a suggestion to port the emulator to run entirely in the browser using JavaScript to avoid backend load issues, and a debate on which period-correct terminal (VT-52 vs. VT-420) would be most authentic.
