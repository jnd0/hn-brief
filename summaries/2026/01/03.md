## [I'm a developer for a major food delivery app](https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/)
**Score:** 580 | **Comments:** 278 | **ID:** 46461563

> **Article:** The article is a "confession" posted to Reddit by an anonymous user claiming to be a developer for a major food delivery app. The author alleges that the company intentionally manipulates the tipping system to maximize its own revenue at the expense of drivers. Specifically, they claim that the app's algorithm withholds tip information from drivers when presenting them with an order. This ensures that drivers accept low-paying orders based on the base fare alone, with the company then using the customer's tip to subsidize the delivery pay instead of adding it as a bonus for the driver. The author states they have quit their job and are posting this information despite a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the anonymous Reddit post, treating it as anecdotal evidence at best and likely fiction at worst. The core themes of the conversation are:

*   **Skepticism and Lack of Evidence:** Many commenters, like cedws, dismiss the post as "fiction" without any verifiable proof. However, others, such as Nextgrid and dieselgate, counter that while it's just one data point, the described behavior is entirely plausible and consistent with the known practices of venture-backed tech companies.
*   **Plausibility and Industry Context:** The general sentiment is that the alleged behavior is believable. Commenters point to a "VC/techbro company playbook" and note that the author's claim of quitting and hoping to be sued adds a layer of credibility, as it would be a risky thing to fabricate.
*   **Broader Company Practices:** The discussion quickly broadens beyond just tip manipulation. One user (Nextgrid) shares a personal anecdote about an order being stuck while the restaurant confirmed it was ready, suggesting a pattern of blaming external parties (restaurants, drivers) for systemic issues. Another user (galkk) adds nuance, cautioning that drivers and restaurants are not always blameless.
*   **User Response and Cynicism:** Commenters express disgust at the alleged practice. Some, like bilekas, state this confirms their decision to tip only in cash. However, there is also a sense of resignation, with one user (Nextgrid) pointing out that if the competition is equally bad, user boycotts may have little effect.
*   **Related Criticisms:** The conversation touches on other grievances with food delivery apps, such as inflated menu prices compared to in-store and the general unsustainability of the gig economy model, which relies on an "infinite supply of suckers."

## [FracturedJson](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki)
**Score:** 524 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46464235

> **Article:** FracturedJson is a tool and library for formatting JSON data into a more readable, "table-like" 2D layout. Instead of a standard nested structure, it aligns elements vertically to make scanning large arrays of objects easier. The project is available for multiple languages, including C# and TypeScript, and includes a CLI tool that can read from standard input and write to standard output, making it suitable for use in command-line pipelines.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the tool's utility, the perennial debate over comments in JSON, and potential integrations. A significant portion of the conversation revisited why the JSON standard doesn't support comments, with participants defending the original design choice as a way to prevent misuse and "feature creep," while others argued for their utility.

Key themes included:
*   **Practical Use Cases:** Commenting was a major topic. While some argued that if comments are needed, a different format like TOML or YAML is more appropriate for configuration files, others highlighted specific use cases like debugging APIs or game development where JSON with comments is valuable.
*   **Tooling and Integration:** Users expressed strong interest in integrating this formatting style into existing tools, particularly `jq`. The discussion confirmed that the CLI tool supports piping, making it easy to chain with other commands.
*   **Readability vs. Consistency:** The tool was praised for improving readability, though one user noted a potential downside: it could make `git diff`s more complex due to realignment. Another user pointed out a potential optimization benefit for LLMs due to reduced token counts, though this was countered by the fact that minified JSON would be even more efficient.
*   **Development and Maintenance:** A suggestion was made to create a language-independent test suite to ensure consistency across the different implementations (C#, TypeScript, Python wrapper) and to facilitate the creation of new ones.

## [HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820)
**Score:** 516 | **Comments:** 291 | **ID:** 46463315

> **Article:** An article in *Eurosurveillance* details the remarkable success of the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. The data shows that the prevalence of the two most oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18) has been reduced from 16% in the pre-vaccination era to less than 1% in vaccinated women. This has led to a dramatic decline in cervical cancer rates, with Denmark now approaching the WHO's threshold for disease elimination.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion overwhelmingly celebrates the Danish program as a major public health success, with commenters noting the country's cervical cancer rates have plummeted to near-elimination levels. Several key themes emerged:

*   **Expanding the Message:** A prominent point is that the public health messaging around HPV is flawed by focusing too narrowly on cervical cancer in women. Commenters argue that a more effective strategy would be to emphasize the serious risks for men—including penile, rectal, and nasopharyngeal cancers—to drive higher male vaccination rates.

*   **Vaccine Hesitancy and Misinformation:** The conversation touched on the challenges of anti-vaccine sentiment. One commenter noted that a misleading, anti-vaccine post had been correctly flagged and hidden. Another user provided a detailed analysis of how such arguments are constructed through selective data omission, while also critiquing public health agencies for failing to proactively address complex topics (like vaccine efficacy in those with pre-existing infections), which creates openings for misinformation.

*   **Policy and Access Issues:** Practical barriers to vaccination were highlighted, particularly for men. One user pointed out that while recommendations for male vaccination have been extended to older age groups (e.g., up to 40 in some places), insurance coverage often stops at 26, leaving a large demographic to pay significant out-of-pocket costs.

*   **The Role of Data Infrastructure:** Several users praised Denmark's robust digital health infrastructure and data tracking capabilities as a critical, and often overlooked, factor in the program's success. They argued that such systems are essential for accurately measuring the effectiveness of public health interventions at a population scale.

*   **Scientific Nuance:** The discussion also included technical points, such as the potential for non-vaccine HPV strains to become more prevalent and the fact that vaccination is still beneficial even for those who are already HPV-positive, as it protects against other strains.

## [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
**Score:** 450 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46463644

> **Article:** The article "10 years of personal finances in plain text files" details the author's decade-long journey of managing their finances using plain text accounting (PTA) software, specifically Beancount. The author advocates for this method over traditional apps, citing benefits like data ownership, portability, version control (using Git), and the ability to perform complex, custom analysis. They outline their workflow, which involves a Python script to import transactions from bank CSVs into the Beancount format, a process they've refined over the years. The post concludes that while there is an initial learning curve, the long-term flexibility and control make it a worthwhile system for tracking all financial assets and liabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with many users sharing their own experiences with Plain Text Accounting (PTA) systems like Beancount, hledger, and ledger-cli. A central theme was the trade-off between the high initial learning curve and the powerful, long-term benefits. Users acknowledged that setting up the system and learning double-entry bookkeeping requires a significant time investment, but argued that the resulting deep financial awareness and control are invaluable.

Several key benefits were highlighted:
*   **Data Ownership and Flexibility:** Users praised having their financial data in simple, portable text files, free from vendor lock-in. This allows for unlimited customization, tracking of non-traditional assets (like unvested RSUs, energy usage, or vacation hours), and building custom tooling.
*   **Holistic Financial View:** Unlike commercial apps that often only connect to bank accounts, PTA allows users to track their entire financial picture, including investments, pensions, and complex liabilities, in one place.
*   **Workflow and Tools:** Many mentioned using Git for version control and syncing. The Fava web-based GUI was frequently recommended as a frontend to Beancount, making it easier to view and search data without sacrificing the plain-text backend. The use of LLMs to help build custom tooling was also mentioned as a modern enhancement.

There was a minor debate about the accessibility of the method, with one user noting it's a niche solution for developers and tech-savvy individuals, not the general public. Another point of contention was the author's credibility, with one commenter accusing the blog post of being an ad for a Beancount book, though others defended the author's significant contributions to the Beancount ecosystem. The time commitment was also discussed, with most concluding that the hours spent were a worthwhile investment in their financial health.

## [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 428 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article links to the IndieWeb concept of POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere). This strategy advocates for creators to publish content primarily on their personal website that they control, and then copy or cross-post that content to third-party platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, or Medium. The core philosophy is to maintain ownership and control over one's content and identity while still leveraging the reach and network effects of centralized social media platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a necessary reclaiming of ownership in an era of walled gardens. Several users shared their personal implementations, with one noting they manually post to their site and then syndicate to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter, while another expressed a desire to automate the process using tools like Posse Party.

A recurring theme was the tension between idealism and practicality. While commenters praised the concept of decentralization, there was a strong emphasis on "friends over federation"—the idea that usability and human connection are more important than technical purity. This pragmatism extended to skepticism about the feasibility of a fully distributed web, with one user lamenting that the window for a semantic, email-like social graph may have closed due to the speed of platforms like Facebook.

The discussion also touched on the broader implications of content ownership. One user framed social media as a marketplace where content is the product and attention is the currency, suggesting POSSE disrupts this by keeping the "goods" on the creator's own property. There was also a counter-perspective that the desire to return to personal sites is a rejection of modern internet culture (and LLMs), though this was met with a defense of online communities for those who lack local ones. Finally, practical warnings were issued regarding the licensing of third-party tools that facilitate this workflow.

## [39th Chaos Communication Congress Videos](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2025)
**Score:** 376 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46464426

> **Article:** The article links to the official media repository for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39c3), a major annual hacker conference held in Hamburg, Germany. The page provides access to the video recordings of all talks from the event. The talks cover a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, hardware hacking, digital rights, privacy, and socio-political commentary on technology. The linked videos are hosted by the media.ccc.de platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on sharing and recommending specific talks from the conference. A prominent topic is Cory Doctorow's speech on "enshittification" and a post-American internet, which users praise for its strong critique of US tech policy and its influence on global data privacy laws. Several other talks are highlighted as favorites, including technical deep dives into hacking GPG, Bluetooth headphone vulnerabilities, and the challenges of in-house electronics manufacturing.

The conversation also touches on a notable controversy: the cancellation of a planned talk by AI researcher Joscha Bach following the public release of his private emails with Jeffrey Epstein. Commenters debate the nature of the emails (which one user clarifies focus on IQ, race, and sex in a non-criminal context) and the ethics of "canceling" a speaker over private correspondence, with some expressing disappointment that a public discussion on the matter did not occur.

Other points of discussion include the conference's political leanings, with one user describing a mix of "very good tech talks and left-wing extremism," a characterization that is challenged by others who argue that antifascism is a core part of the hacker ethos. Finally, there are lighter, community-oriented comments, such as an explanation for the waving cat icon in the video player (a Maneki-neko used as a stream health indicator) and a general appreciation for the event's spirit.

## [Parental controls aren't for parents](https://beasthacker.com/til/parental-controls-arent-for-parents.html)
**Score:** 356 | **Comments:** 374 | **ID:** 46464652

> **Article:** The article "Parental controls aren't for parents" argues that digital parental control systems are fundamentally broken and designed to serve corporate interests rather than help parents. The author, a self-described "beasthacker," details his frustrating experience trying to set up a safe digital environment for his son. He identifies several key problems: the overwhelming complexity of disparate systems (like the conflicting Nintendo and Microsoft accounts required for Minecraft), the lack of granular control (e.g., being unable to block free downloads on the Nintendo eShop without blocking the entire store), and misleading app store ratings that allow "safe" apps to contain dangerous features like unmoderated chat. The author contends that these systems are intentionally designed to "beat down" parents, forcing them to give up and accept the default, most monetizable settings, thereby turning them into "ideal customers."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's core premise that parental controls are inadequate, but expands the conversation to include differing parenting philosophies and critiques of the tech industry.

A central theme is the widespread agreement that existing tools are frustratingly complex and ineffective. Multiple users shared personal anecdotes of struggling with specific platforms like Nintendo Switch (citing the confusing account systems and inability to block free downloads), Disney+ (which lacks per-show blocking), and Roblox (described as a "minefield"). The general sentiment is that these systems are poorly designed, often requiring parents to be technically proficient to navigate them.

This frustration led to a debate on the best parenting strategy. One prominent viewpoint, articulated by user `zaphar`, advocates for a "co-pilot" model where children only use devices with a parent present, eliminating the need for complex controls. However, this was immediately challenged as an unrealistic "luxury" for most families, especially with the prevalence of technology in schools. Another approach, mentioned by `jameskilton`, is a strict "no phone until 16" policy, which other users warned could lead to social isolation for the child.

The discussion also identified a deeper societal problem. User `epiccoleman` argued that the real issue is a widespread apathy among "normal" parents who are unaware of or unconcerned with the dangers of the modern internet. This connects to a more philosophical point from `miroljub`, who suggested that constant digital surveillance in childhood normalizes a lack of privacy, making future generations less likely to care about digital rights. Ultimately, while some users offered practical workarounds like router-level blocks, the consensus was that the burden remains on parents to educate their children and remain vigilant, as the technology itself cannot be trusted to provide a safe environment.

## [Standard Ebooks: Public Domain Day 2026 in Literature](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026)
**Score:** 353 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46462702

> **Article:** This article from Standard Ebooks announces the works that will enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2026. Under US copyright law, works published in 1930 will become freely available. The article highlights several notable titles from that year, including Agatha Christie's *The Murder at the Vicarage*, Kafka's *The Castle*, and Dashiell Hammett's *The Maltese Falcon*. The post serves as both a celebration of the public domain and a showcase for the high-quality, professionally produced ebooks that Standard Ebooks creates from these newly freed texts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing appreciation for the Standard Ebooks project and its high-quality, curated editions. A contributor to the project is present in the thread, answering questions about their work.

Several key themes emerge from the comments:

*   **Project Quality and Process:** Users praise the aesthetic and technical quality of the ebooks. One user asks about the process of sourcing and designing the distinctive book covers, while another provides a link to a detailed blog post comparing Standard Ebooks favorably to other digitization projects like Project Gutenberg. A contributor's anecdote about the manual effort required to create a clean ebook from a scanned paperback highlights the project's commitment to quality.

*   **Copyright Complexity:** The discussion touches on the complexities of international copyright law. Users point out that the article's "Public Domain Day" is specific to the US, and provide examples of how works can be in the public domain in one country (e.g., Canada, the US) but still under copyright in another (e.g., France). This leads to a debate about whether copyright extensions can retroactively restore copyright to works that had already entered the public domain.

*   **Future of Public Domain Culture:** One commenter presents a broader hypothesis that as more high-quality cultural artifacts enter the public domain, they will provide a powerful alternative to the "AI slop" of contemporary media. They envision a future where a steady stream of classic, high-quality content (e.g., from Standard Ebooks) could satisfy a significant portion of cultural consumption needs.

*   **Related Tools and Resources:** The conversation includes mentions of related projects, such as a personal library management app that integrates Standard Ebooks and a link to other HN discussions about Public Domain Day.

## [2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2026/year-linux-desktop/)
**Score:** 311 | **Comments:** 226 | **ID:** 46471199

> **Article:** The article "2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop" is a personal declaration by the author to switch from Windows to Linux as their primary operating system. The author expresses deep frustration with the current state of Windows, citing issues like intrusive AI features (Copilot), bloatware, ads in the Start Menu, and a general decline in quality and user control. They contrast this with the perceived benefits of Linux, such as stability, performance (especially on older hardware), customizability, and a more "honest" computing experience. The post serves as a forward-looking commitment to making the switch, acknowledging the challenges but concluding that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, especially with improvements in gaming compatibility via tools like Proton.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly supportive of the article's sentiment, reflecting a broader trend of users growing dissatisfied with Windows and exploring Linux. A central theme is the critique of modern Windows, with commenters pointing to inconsistent UI frameworks (mixing webviews with native libraries), performance degradation, and aggressive monetization through ads and data collection. Many agree that Microsoft's focus has shifted away from the consumer desktop to enterprise and cloud services, leading to neglect of the core OS experience.

Conversely, commenters highlight the maturing state of the Linux desktop. The success of Valve's Proton is frequently mentioned as a game-changer that has removed the primary barrier for many: gaming. The rise of user-friendly distributions and hardware vendors like System76 is also noted. While some raise concerns about software availability (e.g., Adobe Photoshop) and hardware compatibility (battery life, support), the consensus is that these are becoming smaller hurdles. The discussion also touches on a philosophical level, with many users expressing a desire for control, stability, and a less "hostile" operating system, which they find in Linux. The "year of the Linux desktop" is framed not as a single event, but as a gradual, ongoing migration driven by user frustration and community-driven improvements.

## [Daft Punk Easter Egg in the BPM Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?](https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/)
**Score:** 294 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46469577

> **Article:** The article posits that the tempo of Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" is an intentional easter egg. The author analyzed the track and found its BPM to be exactly 123.45. They argue this isn't a random number but a thematic choice. The song is about the robotic, mass-produced nature of music, and a tempo like 123.45 is something a non-musical manager might simply type into a software field, perfectly fitting the song's narrative of being a cog in a machine.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of appreciation for the thematic connection, technical debate over the exact value, and broader discussion about Daft Punk's cleverness. The most upvoted comment strongly agrees with the article's premise, adding that the song is part of the *Interstella 5555* movie where the characters are abducted and "robotized," making the machine-like 123.45 BPM a perfect fit for the story.

However, the technical analysis was immediately scrutinized. A top-level comment pointed out a calculation error in the original article and, using the correct formula, showed the tempo is actually closer to 123.453 or 123.450 BPM, suggesting the 123.45 figure is only true for the YouTube version within rounding error. This sparked a highly speculative and popular sub-thread where another user attempted to reverse-engineer a more complex number (123.4567 BPM) by incorporating the track's initial silence and beat count, embracing the "red string conspiracy board" nature of the analysis.

Other key discussion points included:
*   **Precedents:** Users cited other famous electronic music "easter eggs," such as Aphex Twin encoding his face in a spectrogram and Venetian Snares encoding his cat.
*   **Source Material:** The conversation touched upon the original sample, "Cola Bottle Baby" by Edwin Birdsong, with a user noting its different tempo (116 BPM).
*   **General Skepticism:** Some users tempered the excitement with technical reality, noting that achieving perfect tempo is difficult even in modern hardware/software and that the value could be a slight average rather than a constant.
*   **Thematic Counterpoint:** One user pushed back on the movie tie-in theory, pointing out that the song was released years before the movie.

## [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
**Score:** 291 | **Comments:** 585 | **ID:** 46465327

> **Article:** This article from The Register marks the 30th anniversary of IPv6, reflecting on its slow and incomplete adoption. It acknowledges that while IPv6 was created to solve IPv4's address exhaustion, it has not replaced its predecessor. Instead, IPv6's primary success has been in absorbing the massive growth in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments, where it is widely deployed but largely invisible to end-users. The article frames the current state as a "dual-stack" world where IPv4 remains essential for many services, and its scarcity has turned it into a valuable, tradable asset. The core message is that IPv6 succeeded in its practical goal of enabling internet growth but failed in its original vision of a clean, global transition away from IPv4.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide between IPv6's large-scale, often invisible success and its persistent friction for individual users, developers, and smaller network administrators. A central theme is the contrast between massive traffic volumes on IPv6 and a widespread lack of practical knowledge among engineers, leading to doubts about its long-term future.

Key points of contention and experience include:

*   **Adoption is Real but Uneven:** While some engineers in large enterprises report that over 75% of their internet traffic is IPv6, many others in residential, self-hosting, or specific regional contexts find their ISPs or services offer little to no support. The massive adoption in regions like China is noted as a significant driver of global statistics.
*   **User and Developer Friction:** For individuals and self-hosters, IPv6 is often described as a "nightmare." Issues include ISPs refusing static prefixes for residential customers, critical software and services (like some game servers) lacking support, and the general complexity of managing a dual-stack environment. This forces reliance on IPv4 or complex workarounds like tunnels.
*   **The Privacy Debate:** A major point of contention is privacy. Some users argue that IPv6's device-level addressing is a gift to surveillance, preferring the "casual anonymity" of IPv4's NAT. Others counter that this is a misunderstanding, pointing out that ISPs can be subpoenaed for both IPv4 and IPv6 assignment data, and that browser fingerprinting is a far greater threat regardless of the IP version.
*   **Economic and Practical Realities:** The discussion highlights the economic consequences of IPv4 scarcity, with predictions that IPv4 addresses will be treated like real estate, rented or sold as a separate commodity. This creates a financial incentive to stick with IPv4, even as IPv6 addresses are technically free.
*   **The Future Outlook:** The consensus is that IPv6 is the undeniable future for mobile and IoT devices, where its vast address space is a necessity. However, for traditional computing and networking, the transition remains slow and fraught with practical hurdles, leading many to believe a dual-stack internet is the likely reality for the foreseeable future.

## [Clicks Communicator](https://www.clicksphone.com/en/communicator)
**Score:** 279 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46467057

> **Article:** The article links to the product page for "Clicks Communicator," a physical keyboard case designed for modern smartphones (initially for iPhone 15/16 series and Samsung S25). It aims to bring back the tactile typing experience of classic devices like the BlackBerry. The keyboard connects via USB-C or Lightning, features backlighting, and includes a dedicated "Command" key for iOS shortcuts. The product is marketed as a tool for faster, more accurate typing and increased productivity, allowing users to type without looking and reducing reliance on autocorrect.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is mixed but generally intrigued, centering on nostalgia, productivity, and technical limitations.

There is a strong undercurrent of nostalgia, with many users reminiscing about BlackBerry, Palm Treo, and the utility of physical keyboards. Several users express that they never adapted as efficiently to touchscreen typing as they were with physical keys. However, skepticism exists regarding the product's viability as a primary device. While some hope for a "distraction-free" experience, others argue that users lack the agency to avoid addictive apps like TikTok, suggesting the device is better suited as a secondary "work" device rather than a total phone replacement.

From a productivity standpoint, the device is praised by proponents for enabling touch-typing and reducing autocorrect errors, which is seen as a game-changer for writing long emails or code. Conversely, critics point out that the keyboard lacks essential keys (like Ctrl or arrow keys) and that modern dictation tools might be more efficient for interacting with AI agents than typing on a small physical board.

Technical discussions focus on customization and platform limitations. Users express a strong desire for the hardware to support Linux or custom operating systems like GrapheneOS, lamenting the lack of information on bootloader unlockability. There is also a divide on the form factor; while some prefer the keyboard case, others are waiting for a standalone MagSafe keyboard or are trying to use the "front screen" of foldables/flip phones to achieve a similar result.

## [Assorted less(1) tips](https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/)
**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46464120

> **Article:** This article provides a collection of advanced tips and tricks for the `less` command-line pager to improve user productivity. Key tips include:
*   **Navigation & Display:** Using `-R` to handle color codes correctly, `-X` to prevent clearing the screen on exit, and `-E` to quit automatically if the content fits on one screen.
*   **Filtering:** Using `&` to filter lines to show only matches (with regex support) and `&!` to exclude lines.
*   **Live Monitoring:** Using `+F` or `F` (within the pager) to "follow" a file or input stream, similar to `tail -f`, but with the ability to pause and search.
*   **Saving & Configuring:** Using the `s` command to save a portion of the output to a file, and using a `.lesskey` file to customize key bindings.
*   **Miscellaneous:** Using `-L` to disable pre-processing (useful for log files) and `Ctrl-R` for literal string searching.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's tips and expands on them with further suggestions and alternatives. A central theme is the comparison between `less` and other tools, with users mentioning `most` as a pager alternative and `glow` for rendering Markdown. Several users shared their own essential `less` flags, with a popular combination being `-SEXIER`, which combines many of the article's tips for a more user-friendly experience.

The `less +F` follow mode was a highlight, with multiple users expressing surprise at its power, especially the ability to pause, search, and resume following within the same session. The utility of the `s` key to save output from a pipe was also praised as a great way to capture data without pre-committing to a file. A recurring pain point for macOS users is the lack of `lesskey` support on the system-default version, forcing them to install a newer version via Homebrew to enable key customization. Finally, users mentioned modern alternatives like `ov` and `moor`, suggesting that while `less` is powerful, the ecosystem is still evolving.

## [A confession from a mainstream food delivery app engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/gbrh2zxeou)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46461578

> **Article:** The article is a purported confession from an engineer at a mainstream food delivery app (likely DoorDash or a similar platform). The author claims that "Priority Delivery" is a scam that does not actually speed up delivery but merely sets a boolean flag that the dispatch logic ignores. The post alleges the company manipulates driver pay by hiding customer tips and using psychological tactics to squeeze margins from both drivers and customers. The author states they are posting anonymously from a library to avoid legal repercussions from their NDA.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the confession's authenticity, with many users finding the details implausible. Several key arguments against the post's credibility emerged: users noted that the author used a burner laptop on public Wi-Fi yet included specific details that could easily lead to doxxing. Others argued that the alleged level of transparency—where product managers supposedly explain the specific intent of "squeezing margins" directly to backend engineers—is unrealistic for large, siloed tech companies.

Regarding the specific claims, the community was divided. While some shared anecdotes about price discrimination and hidden fees, the claim that "Priority Delivery" does nothing was strongly contested. Several users argued that based on their personal experience, paying for priority delivery effectively prevents order bundling and ensures a direct route, contradicting the author's claim that the feature is entirely ignored by the system. The consensus leaned toward treating the story as unverified fiction or creative writing rather than a genuine whistleblower report.

## [Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal](https://unixv4.dev/)
**Score:** 133 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46468283

> **Article:** The article links to a website, "unixv4.dev", which provides a live, interactive terminal session emulating the PDP-11 architecture running the historical Unix v4 operating system from 1973. The site offers users a hands-on way to experience this vintage computing environment directly in their browser.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, reflecting the classic HN mix of technical curiosity, skepticism, and humor. The primary themes were:

*   **Access and Availability:** The site was immediately popular, with many users reporting that it was quickly "hugged to death" or rate-limited due to the traffic spike from HN. This prompted jokes about "slashdotting" and the "HN deathhug."

*   **Security and Privacy Concerns:** A significant point of debate was the trustworthiness of the service. One commenter raised concerns about the site's logging policy and the fact that it wasn't open source, making it difficult to verify where data was going. Others countered that the threat model was negligible for a curiosity-driven PDP-11 emulator, asking who would use it for sensitive tasks.

*   **Legality and Copyright:** Users questioned the legal status of the emulated software, wondering if the creators had obtained a license from the current owners (Novell/Caldera). A knowledgeable commenter clarified that Caldera had released research Unix versions up to v7 under a BSD-style license, likely making the project legal, provided the correct attribution notice was included.

*   **Technical and Historical Curiosities:** The discussion also delved into technical details. One user linked to an external blog post analyzing the site's source code and finding a buffer overflow, sparking a conversation about the state of security awareness in the 1970s. Another thread discussed the possibility of running the entire emulator in-browser to avoid backend load, and a user even offered to contribute a more period-accurate browser-based terminal emulator for the project.

## [A small collection of text-only websites](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/)
**Score:** 133 | **Comments:** 57 | **ID:** 46463635

> **Article:** The article "A small collection of text-only websites" presents a curated list of websites that prioritize plain text over rich media and heavy styling. It highlights sites like Daring Fireball (via its .text extension), NPR, and CNN, which offer lightweight, readable versions of their content. The author advocates for this minimalist approach, suggesting it improves accessibility, performance, and user experience for those who prefer simplicity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively, expanding on the article's theme by sharing additional examples and reflecting on the history and utility of text-only design. Key discussion points included:

*   **Sharing More Examples:** Users contributed numerous other "lite" or text-only versions of major sites, such as text.npr.org, lite.cnn.com, and lite.cbc.ca.
*   **Historical Context:** Commenters recalled that text-only versions were once common for "printer-friendly" pages and became critical during high-traffic events like the 9/11 attacks, when CNN's main site failed.
*   **Modern Implementation:** Developers discussed practical ways to implement text-only views, such as serving content via `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.txt` extensions, which can also serve as a good discipline for separating data from presentation.
*   **Broader Philosophy:** The conversation touched on related minimalist technologies like the Gemini and Gopher protocols. There was also a debate about whether sites on the "textonly.website" list are truly text-only or just minimally styled HTML/CSS, highlighting a distinction between pure text and minimalist design.
*   **Nostalgia and Aesthetics:** Participants noted the enduring, simple design of sites like berkshirehathaway.com and discussed how the quality of "print to PDF" functionality has degraded on modern websites.

## [Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams](https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html)
**Score:** 129 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46467677

> **Article:** The article "Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams" proposes a technical solution to the problem of academic cheating in the age of generative AI. The author argues that since written take-home assignments are now easily completed by AI, educators must return to in-person assessment. However, traditional oral exams are not scalable for large classes. The proposed solution is to use an AI agent to conduct one-on-one oral exams via webcam. The AI asks personalized, follow-up questions based on the student's submitted work (e.g., a project or essay) and analyzes their verbal responses in real-time to assess genuine understanding. The system is designed to be low-cost (approx. $0.42 per student) and can be run continuously. The author presents this as a necessary adaptation to maintain academic integrity when technology has made old methods obsolete.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep skepticism about the proposed AI oral exam system, focusing on its ethical implications, practical flaws, and the broader crisis in education it represents.

A central theme is the dehumanizing nature of being assessed by an algorithm. Many commenters expressed a strong visceral dislike for the idea of a high-stakes exam administered by a "shitty program," arguing that it lacks the respect and human element of an exam with a human professor. This sentiment was extended to the hiring world, with one user sharing a negative experience with an AI interview and another admitting they felt no remorse about trying to trick or mislead an AI system, something they would never do to a person.

The practicality and security of the system were heavily questioned. Commenters immediately identified numerous ways to cheat the proposed webcam-based system, such as using a teleprompter, bone-conduction microphones, or smart glasses to receive answers from another AI. This led to a cynical view that it would just create an arms race of "chatbots taking exams that are administered by other chatbots." The general feeling was that any purely technical solution to cheating is ultimately futile.

Several commenters questioned the premise of the article, suggesting that if AI is used for assessment, it could just as easily be used for teaching, rendering the entire educational model obsolete. Others proposed simpler, non-AI solutions like traditional written in-class exams or smaller, human-run oral sessions.

Underlying the discussion was a sense of resignation about the current state of education and hiring. Commenters noted that the "cheating" problem is real, with students and job applicants using AI and often not understanding their own submitted work. However, instead of seeing the AI proctor as a solution, the discussion framed it as a symptom of a broken system, with many concluding that the only real path forward is a radical rethinking of education and assessment, perhaps moving away from it altogether.
