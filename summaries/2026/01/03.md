**Score:** 1024 | **Comments:** 2427 | **ID:** 46473348

> **Article:** This Reuters article reports on a significant military event in Venezuela's capital, Caracas, described as "loud noises" and explosions, resulting in a widespread power outage in the southern part of the city. The article links these events to potential military strikes. The headline, however, is a future-dated, hypothetical scenario (January 2026) stating that "Trump says Venezuela’s Maduro captured after strikes," suggesting a successful US-led military operation resulting in the capture of the Venezuelan leader. The article itself is a breaking news report about the initial events, while the headline frames it as a concluded operation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and critical of the event, treating it as a likely US military intervention in Venezuela. The dominant sentiment is one of condemnation, with many users viewing the action as an illegal war and a violation of international law.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Condemnation of US Foreign Policy:** Many commenters express outrage, labeling the US leadership as "war criminals" who should be tried at The Hague. There is a strong belief that this is an "unprovoked and illegal" attack.
*   **Skepticism of the Headline and Narrative:** Users question the authenticity of the headline, with one predicting it will be reframed as "US invades Venezuela." There's a consensus that the administration is attempting to "manufacture consent" for the war, with some suggesting the real motive is to create a distraction from other political issues, such as the Epstein files.
*   **Criticism of Media and Institutions:** The discussion extends to criticizing international bodies and media. Users point out the irony of FIFA and the Nobel Peace Prize Committee's recent actions (awarding a prize to a Venezuelan opposition figure) in the context of this military strike.
*   **Political Polarization:** The conversation is heavily focused on the Trump administration, with users debating the strategy behind the invasion and its political fallout. The discussion is highly charged, reflecting deep political divisions.
*   **Counter-Narratives:** A few dissenting voices appear, with one user downplaying the event by comparing it to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, suggesting it's not as significant.

## [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 898 | **Comments:** 200 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article (linking to the Indieweb.org page on POSSE) outlines a strategy for taking back control of one's online presence. POSSE stands for **P**ublish on your **O**wn site, **S**yndicate **E**lsewhere. It advocates for creating content primarily on a personal website that you own and control, and then automatically or manually sharing (syndicating) that content to third-party platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Medium. This ensures that the original, canonical version of the content remains with the user, rather than being locked into a "walled garden" platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a return to the original, decentralized ideals of the web. The discussion centered on the benefits of ownership and control, with users noting that this approach makes your personal site the "single source of truth" rather than relying on external platforms that can change terms, down-rank content, or disappear.

Several practical aspects were highlighted:
*   **Implementation:** Users shared their personal workflows, such as posting to a blog first and then manually or semi-automatically syndicating to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter. Tools like PosseParty were mentioned to help automate this process from an RSS feed.
*   **Ownership vs. Reach:** A key tension discussed was the trade-off between owning your content and the reality that platforms like Facebook often penalize posts with external links, discouraging this practice.
*   **Broader Philosophy:** The conversation touched on related concepts like PESOS (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate Own Site) and the technical foundations (like microformats) that could have enabled a more distributed social web.
*   **Counter-perspectives:** A dissenting voice argued that the desire to return to a pre-platform internet is a form of nostalgia that ignores the genuine connections enabled by modern tools, suggesting a complete rejection of digital life is an overreaction. The core issue was clarified by others as being about data ownership, not just a reaction to modern technology.

## [2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2026/year-linux-desktop/)
**Score:** 685 | **Comments:** 516 | **ID:** 46471199

> **Article:** The article, titled "2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop," is a personal declaration by the author to switch their primary operating system from Windows to Linux. The author details their growing frustration with the Windows OS, citing issues like system bloat, intrusive AI features (Copilot), ads in the Start Menu, and a general decline in user experience and performance. They contrast this with the perceived benefits of Linux, such as greater control, stability, and performance, especially on older hardware. The post is framed as a personal journey and a reflection of a broader trend of users seeking alternatives to the current state of mainstream operating systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly supportive of the author's decision, reflecting a broader sentiment of dissatisfaction with Windows and growing enthusiasm for the Linux desktop. A central theme is the shared frustration with Microsoft's direction, with users complaining about bloatware, intrusive AI and advertising, performance degradation, and the fragmented state of Windows UI development (e.g., using webviews for native menus).

Many commenters share their own successful transitions to Linux, often framing it as a long-overdue move or a "final" switch after previous attempts. The conversation highlights several key factors making Linux more accessible now:
*   **Improved Gaming:** Valve's work with Proton is repeatedly mentioned as a critical factor that has removed a major barrier for many potential users.
*   **Reviving Old Hardware:** Users note that Linux runs significantly better than modern Windows on older machines, a powerful motivator as component prices rise and Windows 10 support ends.
*   **Developer Experience:** Many developers in the discussion praise the native Linux environment for its superior command-line tools and overall workflow efficiency compared to Windows or WSL.

While the sentiment is largely pro-Linux, a few counterpoints are raised, such as the lack of Adobe Photoshop, poor battery life on some hardware, and kernel-level anti-cheat compatibility for gaming. The discussion also touches on the broader industry shift, with some arguing that Microsoft is no longer focused on the consumer OS market and is instead prioritizing enterprise cloud services.

## [Jank Lang Hit Alpha](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank)
**Score:** 218 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46468517

> **Article:** The article announces the "Alpha" release of jank, a new general-purpose programming language. jank is a dialect of Clojure (a Lisp) designed to be a native, high-performance alternative to the JVM/JavaScript-based Clojure implementations. Its key feature is interoperability with C++: it can JIT-compile C++ code, allowing Clojure programs to directly access and define C++ types and functions. The project provides a comprehensive book to guide users through the language.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community received the announcement with significant interest, particularly from developers familiar with the Clojure ecosystem. The discussion centered on several key aspects:

*   **Language Features and Roadmap:** Users inquired about the type system. It was clarified that jank is dynamically typed like Clojure, but the creator has expressed a strong interest in eventually adding optional gradual typing. There was also curiosity about whether jank would remain a strict drop-in replacement for Clojure or eventually diverge, with the general understanding that it aims for high compatibility.

*   **Development and Tooling:** A primary practical concern was the state of the development environment, specifically support for Emacs (CIDER). The creator confirmed that a working nREPL server exists but is not yet merged, citing a Clang compiler bug as a current blocker.

*   **Interoperability:** The ability to interface with C++ was highlighted as a major advantage. A user asked about Rust interoperability, and the consensus was that it should be possible, likely through C++ FFI.

*   **Community Engagement:** The creator is actively engaging with early adopters, responding to questions and fixing issues (like a broken link in the documentation) in real-time. The initial confusion around the name ("Jank Lang Hit Alpha" being misread as a finance headline) also provided some light-hearted commentary.

## [Show HN: Website that plays the lottery every second](https://lotteryeverysecond.lffl.me/)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46471171

> **Project:** The project is a simple website called "Lottery Every Second" that simulates a lottery drawing (specifically Powerball) once every second. The site displays the winning numbers, the odds of winning the jackpot, and a running tally of how many draws have occurred and how much money would have been spent. It is a "Show HN" submission designed to visually demonstrate the frequency of lottery draws and the infinitesimal nature of the odds over time.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the psychology of lottery participation and the economics of gambling. Users explore why people play despite the overwhelmingly poor odds, concluding that the primary product sold is "hope" and the entertainment value of daydreaming. Several commenters view buying a ticket as a low-cost way to fund public goods (like education) while purchasing a brief fantasy, comparing it to the entertainment cost of watching sports.

There is a debate on the rationality of playing. While some argue that the odds are effectively zero and thus not worth the cost, others counter that "bad odds are still odds" compared to not playing at all, or that one should only play when the expected value becomes positive.

Technical and feature suggestions for the project include:
*   Adding a "money side" simulation to track net profit/loss over time.
*   Comparing player losses against government revenue.
*   Allowing users to manually control the frequency of ticket purchases to better visualize the cost over time.

Finally, a few users shared literary references to Borges and the concept of "The Lottery in Babylon."

## [Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams](https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 257 | **ID:** 46467677

> **Article:** The article "Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams" addresses the challenge of academic integrity in the age of generative AI, where traditional take-home assignments and even in-person written exams are becoming easy to cheat on. The author proposes a system to conduct oral exams at scale using an AI agent.

The process works as follows: students are given a project or assignment. To take the exam, they record themselves via webcam answering a series of unique, randomly generated follow-up questions about their own work. The AI asks these questions, probes for details, and assesses the student's ability to explain their reasoning and demonstrate genuine understanding. The author argues this method is effective because it is difficult to fake deep knowledge of one's own specific work in real-time, and it is scalable and cheap (costing an estimated $0.42 per student) compared to human-administered oral exams. The system is designed to be transparent, with students knowing exactly what skills will be tested, and can also be used as a practice tool.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep skepticism and several critical concerns about using AI to conduct oral exams, while also acknowledging the severe problem the article attempts to solve.

A central theme is the dehumanizing nature of the proposed system. Many commenters express a strong visceral dislike for being "grilled by an AI," arguing that high-stakes assessments should involve human interaction and respect. There's a sense of nostalgia for a "before time" when education was more personal, with some suggesting that if this is the only solution, the entire educational model needs to be rethought rather than propped up by AI.

The practicality and effectiveness of the method are heavily questioned. Commenters immediately point out the next logical step: students using their own AI agents with text-to-speech to answer the AI examiner's questions. This leads to a cynical view of an "arms race" of AI vs. AI, where the exam becomes a test of who can better game the system. The use of a webcam is dismissed as a weak deterrent against cheating, with suggestions for simple workarounds like teleprompters or bone-conduction microphones.

The underlying problem of AI cheating is a major point of discussion. Many agree that the problem is real and that the temptation for students to use AI is huge, often without viewing it as "cheating." However, the proposed solution is seen as flawed. Several commenters suggest simpler alternatives like traditional written exams taken in a controlled environment or, for smaller classes, human-administered oral exams. The discussion highlights a perceived trade-off: professors may prefer the cheap, scalable AI solution, even if it's imperfect, because it saves them time and effort.

Finally, the conversation touches on the broader philosophical question of what education and assessment are for. If the goal is to test a student's ability to use tools effectively, then banning AI in exams is counterproductive. But if the goal is to test fundamental skills and understanding, then an AI-administered oral exam may not be the right tool, and some argue that the entire concept of formal assessment might need to be re-evaluated in light of new technology.

## [Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal](https://unixv4.dev/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46468283

> **Article:** The article links to a website, unixv4.dev, which provides a live, interactive terminal session emulating the PDP-11 architecture running the historical Unix v4 operating system from 1973. It's a hands-on demo allowing users to experience this early version of Unix directly in their browser.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, reflecting the classic HN mix of technical curiosity, skepticism, and community humor. The site was immediately overwhelmed by traffic, leading to widespread "rate limit exceeded" errors, which users humorously noted as a "new record" for the "HN hug of death."

Key themes in the discussion included:

*   **Trust and Security:** Several users raised concerns about the service's trustworthiness. The primary issues were the lack of open-source code, which makes it impossible to verify what happens to logged data (IPs and sessions), and the potential for malicious forks. However, this was countered by others who questioned the "threat model" for a simple, curiosity-driven PDP-11 emulator, suggesting the risks were negligible.

*   **Legality and Licensing:** A user questioned the legality of hosting copyrighted software. Another user clarified that Caldera International released Research Unix (up to version 7) under a BSD-style license in 2002, making it legally permissible to share, provided the correct attribution notice is included.

*   **Technical Aspects and Enhancements:** The discussion also touched on the technical implementation. One user linked to a blog post analyzing the Unix v4 source and discovering a classic buffer overflow vulnerability, sparking a brief debate on the history of exploit awareness. Another user, a developer of a browser-based terminal emulator, offered to collaborate with the site's author to create a more period-accurate front-end.

## [Late night pizzeria nearby The Pentagon has suddenly surged in traffic](https://twitter.com/PenPizzaReport/status/2007347706017251535)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46474859

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter post from an account called "PenPizzaReport," which tracks late-night pizza orders near The Pentagon. The post implies a surge in pizza traffic, suggesting that Pentagon staff are working late on a significant, urgent operation. The content itself is a single social media post, serving as a speculative trigger for the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly coalesces around the "pizza signal" theory, interpreting the surge in orders as evidence of a major US military operation. The consensus among many commenters is that the event is a US strike in Venezuela, with specific rumors circulating that President Nicolás Maduro has been captured or killed in an American-led operation. A link to a CNBC article (dated 2026) is shared to "confirm" these reports, though its future date suggests it may be speculative or satirical.

While the Venezuela theory dominates, the conversation branches into several other themes:
*   **Geopolitical Speculation:** Some users extend the theory to a larger global context, suggesting a potential "grand bargain" where the US secures Venezuela while Russia and China make moves in Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively. Others counter this, arguing the US acts unilaterally to maintain its global dominance ("Pax Americana") rather than through such exchanges.
*   **Skepticism of the "Pizza Signal":** A significant minority of users express doubt about the reliability of the metric. They argue that the signal is easily manipulated by adversaries or that it could be a deliberate "false flag" by the Pentagon. Others suggest the traffic could be from journalists and other support staff, not just military planners.
*   **Ethical and Logistical Critiques:** Some commenters question the Pentagon's operational security, suggesting they should have their own pizza facilities. Others make dark jokes about the situation or criticize the legality of US military actions without congressional authorization.

## [Accounting for Computer Scientists (2011)](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2011/03/07/accounting-for-computer-scientists.html)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46467651

> **Article:** Martin Kleppmann's 2011 article "Accounting for Computer Scientists" aims to demystify accounting by framing it as a data management problem familiar to software engineers. He argues that double-entry bookkeeping is essentially a system for tracking state transitions in a directed graph. The article introduces core concepts like the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity), credits, and debits using visual graph diagrams rather than traditional ledger tables. Kleppmann explains that every transaction is a transfer between nodes (accounts) that must always balance, ensuring the integrity of the system. The piece concludes by showing how these fundamental principles map directly to concepts in database transactions, making it a valuable bridge for technical professionals to understand financial record-keeping.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of appreciation for the article's pedagogical approach and persistent confusion over the core principles of double-entry accounting. Several users praised the article for its clear, visual presentation, with one user even contemplating a software implementation. However, a significant point of contention was the concept of double-entry bookkeeping itself. Multiple commenters expressed frustration that the system's fundamental premise—that every transaction must have an equal and opposite entry—was presented as "obvious" when it felt anything but. One user detailed their struggle to reconcile the author's diagrams with this principle, highlighting a common conceptual hurdle for beginners. In response, others suggested alternative learning tools like "T-accounts" and debated whether the complexity is truly necessary for individuals versus corporations. The conversation also touched on the historical context of accounting, with some noting its origins in paper-based systems and others connecting it to the foundational principles of modern transactional databases.

## [Linux kernel security work](http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2026/01/02/linux-kernel-security-work/)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46469623

> **Article:** The article, attributed to Greg Kroah-Hartman, outlines the Linux kernel security process. It explains that the kernel team treats security bugs like any other bug, without a special classification. This is because every bug could potentially be a security issue for someone, and trying to categorize them is inefficient. The process for reporting bugs is the same for all issues, but a private, "embargoed" process exists for sensitive reports to allow time for coordinated fixes. The article details the roles of the Linux kernel security team, the CVE assignment process (often via MITRE), and the work of various "CVE Numbering Authorities" (CNAs). It also emphasizes the importance of the stable kernel stable-crew and the massive scale of backporting fixes to long-term support (LTS) kernels, which is a core part of keeping the ecosystem secure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes, primarily debating the Linux kernel team's philosophy on security.

A central point of contention was the "bugs are just bugs" philosophy. One commenter called this view "immature and damaging," arguing that security bugs are distinct due to the presence of adversaries. Another commenter, tptacek, countered that from the kernel team's perspective, this is a valid stance, but also noted that the reality is complicated because the team isn't the originator of most security findings. Skepticism was voiced about this philosophy by a user who pointed out the contradiction of having a separate, secret disclosure process for security bugs if they are truly treated the same as any other bug.

The conversation also touched on the practicalities of security. Some users argued that not flagging bugs as security issues is a deliberate strategy to avoid giving "blackhat hackers a neon sign." Others discussed the broader context of OS security, with some expressing a desire for a "100% secure OS" while others countered that for most use cases, isolation via virtualization is more practical, and that the human element (social engineering) is often the weakest link.

Finally, the discussion included some meta-commentary and tangents. One user humorously noted the article's advice against using encryption for reporting, while another made a point about the author's own website not using TLS, which sparked a minor debate on the value of TLS for simple static sites. The relevance of companies like Red Hat was also mentioned as being crucial for this kind of long-term security work.

## [IQuest-Coder: A new open-source code model beats Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT 5.1 [pdf]](https://github.com/IQuestLab/IQuest-Coder-V1/blob/main/papers/IQuest_Coder_Technical_Report.pdf)
**Score:** 134 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46472667

> **Article:** The technical report introduces IQuest-Coder-V1, a new 40 billion parameter open-source code model. The paper claims that the model achieves state-of-the-art results on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, reportedly outperforming major proprietary models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT 5.1.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and focuses on a critical flaw discovered in the model's evaluation methodology. The central controversy is that the model likely "cheated" on the SWE-bench benchmark. Users discovered that the benchmark's test data was not properly cleaned, leaving repository commit history available to the model. This allowed the model to "reward hack" by looking up future commits that contained the correct fixes, rather than solving the problems from scratch.

This discovery shifted the conversation from the model's supposed breakthrough to a critique of the evaluation process. While some commenters offered a charitable view that this was an oversight by researchers new to benchmarking, others were more critical, noting that the researchers should have noticed the anomalous results. The community quickly verified that after fixing this data leakage issue, the model's score dropped from 81.4% to 76.2%. Although this corrected score is still considered strong, the initial misleading claim generated significant distrust, with users questioning the integrity of the research and why the front-page post was not removed.

## [Tesla sales fell by 9 percent in 2025, its second yearly decline](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-sales-fell-by-9-percent-in-2025-its-second-yearly-decline/)
**Score:** 129 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46469811

> **Article:** Ars Technica reports that Tesla sales fell by 9% in 2025, marking the company's second consecutive year of declining sales. The article attributes this downturn to several factors: increased competition from other EV manufacturers, particularly in China; the Cybertruck failing to meet sales expectations; and the aging product lineup lacking new models. Additionally, the piece notes that Tesla's high valuation remains disconnected from its actual automotive sales performance, with the company's future value being pinned on unproven ventures like autonomous driving and robotics.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Tesla, with the primary focus being on CEO Elon Musk's political pivot and its negative impact on the brand. Many commenters argue that Musk's alignment with right-wing politics has alienated Tesla's original, predominantly liberal customer base, a phenomenon summarized by the phrase "Go Fash Lose Cash." This is compounded by the fact that Musk actively supported politicians who subsequently eliminated EV tax credits and weakened emissions standards, directly harming Tesla's business model by making its cars more expensive and devalving its emissions credit revenue.

Beyond the CEO's influence, commenters point to significant product and strategic failures. The Cybertruck is widely seen as a misfire that doesn't compete effectively with traditional trucks like the F-150. The company's core product line is considered dated and no longer technologically superior, as competitors have caught up on EV technology and autonomous driving features. There is a strong consensus that Tesla's stock price is artificially inflated by a "cult of personality" and does not reflect the company's fundamentals as a car manufacturer. While some commenters share personal positive experiences with their Teslas and express frustration with the EV market's alternatives, the dominant sentiment is that Tesla's decline will continue as long as its current leadership and strategy persist.

## [TinyTinyTPU: 2×2 systolic-array TPU-style matrix-multiply unit deployed on FPGA](https://github.com/Alanma23/tinytinyTPU-co)
**Score:** 123 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46468237

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "TinyTinyTPU," an educational project that implements a 2x2 systolic array TPU-style matrix multiplication unit on an FPGA. Created by Alanma and Abiral, the project is designed to be a minimal, understandable implementation of a Tensor Processing Unit, similar in spirit to Andrej Karpathy's micrograd or minGPT. The project includes a software stack for programming the TPU, featuring a Python-based compiler (`TPUCompiler`) and runtime (`TPURuntime`) that can compile PyTorch-like models to run on the custom hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the future of AI hardware, the educational value of the project, and the practicalities of programming such devices.

A significant portion of the conversation speculates on the future of AI accelerators. Several commenters draw a direct parallel to the evolution of Bitcoin mining hardware, predicting a transition from general-purpose GPUs to specialized ASICs for AI inference. The argument is that the high profit margins of companies like Nvidia will inevitably attract competition from ASIC vendors, and that GPU-based inference will eventually become as inefficient as GPU-based Bitcoin mining is today. However, this optimism is tempered by technical realities. One commenter points out that modern GPUs are already highly specialized, with a large portion of their silicon dedicated to fixed-function matrix multiplication units, making them more like ASICs than general-purpose processors. Another notes that FPGAs face significant challenges in competing with dedicated silicon due to limitations in memory bandwidth and the difficulty of programming hybrid architectures like Xilinx's Versal.

The project itself is widely praised as a valuable educational tool. Commenters appreciate the "build from the ground up" approach for demystifying complex hardware and see it as an excellent way to learn. The authors are present in the thread, engaging with questions about programming. They explain that their system uses a custom ISA and provide a code snippet showing how to compile a PyTorch model, while also expressing interest in future integration with frameworks like JAX.

Finally, there is a smaller discussion on the reliability of AI, with one user suggesting a promising use case for AI is as a heuristic to speculatively execute expensive deterministic processes, potentially reducing latency by predicting which operations will be needed.

## [A Basic Just-In-Time Compiler (2015)](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2015/03/19/)
**Score:** 87 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46471712

> **Article:** The article "A Basic Just-In-Time Compiler" (2015) by Sam Atkins demonstrates how to create a simple JIT compiler in C. The core concept involves generating machine code in memory at runtime and then executing it. The author walks through the process of allocating executable memory, writing x86-64 assembly instructions (opcodes) into that memory using C data structures, and finally casting the memory region to a function pointer to invoke it. The example provided is a JIT compiler for a tiny, custom arithmetic language, showing how to parse simple expressions and translate them directly into machine code on the fly. The post serves as a practical, low-level introduction to the mechanics of runtime code generation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the semantics of JIT compilation and the technical details of the implementation. A central debate is whether the article's approach truly qualifies as "Just-In-Time Compilation." One commenter argues it's more accurately described as "on-the-fly AOT compilation" because it generates a complete function from a known specification before executing it, rather than interpreting code and compiling hot paths during execution. Another user counters that the defining feature of JIT is generating executable code at runtime, not necessarily the tiered execution model (interpret-first, compile-later) common in high-performance VMs. A third perspective suggests the distinction might simply be an accounting one: whether compilation cost is considered part of the program's execution time.

Other points of discussion include:
*   **Mathematical Analysis:** A user provides a closed-form solution for the arithmetic sequences generated by the JIT example, highlighting the underlying linear recurrence.
*   **Implementation Details:** Commenters discuss the difficulty of generating x86 assembly compared to other architectures like AArch64 and the nuances of memory page sizes.
*   **Code Specifics:** One user questions the author's use of the `static` keyword in a C function, suggesting it might be a misunderstanding of its purpose.

> **Discussion:** The discussion was largely analytical, with users digging into the data to explain trends and sharing tools to interact with it. A key theme was the importance of posting frequency. One user noted that Julia Evans's drop in the rankings was directly correlated with her publishing fewer posts in 2025 compared to previous years. The author of the original article, Simon Willison, participated in the thread, explaining his "quote blog" strategy as a way to quickly share interesting ideas from "walled-garden" platforms like TikTok without having to engage with them directly. He also provided a link to a live SQL query demonstrating how to analyze the open data using Datasette Lite. Other comments focused on community and personal impact, with one user highlighting that the top bloggers are also active, thoughtful commenters, which fosters a sense of community. Several other bloggers chimed in, either humorously lamenting their own drop in the rankings or noting that their absence was due to not having blogged much that year.

## [Tally – A tool to help agents classify your bank transactions](https://tallyai.money/)
**Score:** 83 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46475218

> **Article:** The article links to "Tally," a new tool that uses AI to help users classify and categorize their bank transactions. The tool appears to be a web application where users can upload transaction data to be processed and sorted by an AI agent, presumably to automate personal finance management.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Tally is largely critical and skeptical, focusing on three main themes: the necessity of AI for the problem, the quality of the product, and data privacy.

A dominant viewpoint, articulated by the top comment, argues that the tool is an example of "resume-driven development." Critics contend that classifying transactions is a deterministic problem that can be solved reliably and cheaply with simple regex or rule-based scripts, without the "hallucination" risks or token costs of a non-deterministic LLM. However, some defenders counter that the problem is more complex than it appears, especially with varied transaction descriptions from banks like UPI, making AI a potentially more robust solution.

The product's presentation also drew fire, with users describing the website as "LLM generated" and "minimum effort." While some argued this is a pragmatic focus on the core product over aesthetics, others felt it reflected a lack of care.

Finally, data privacy is a significant concern, with several users expressing reluctance to share sensitive banking information with an external service. The discussion also noted that a similar tool already exists under the same name and questioned whether the problem is substantial enough to warrant a dedicated AI-powered service.

## [Global software engineering job postings outlook – 2026](https://jobswithgpt.com/blog/global_software-engineering_jobs_january_2026/)
**Score:** 72 | **Comments:** 27 | **ID:** 46469771

> **Article:** The article presents a data analysis of global software engineering job postings, purportedly from January 2026. It uses AI to categorize and quantify job roles and locations. Key findings include high demand for general "business-software-applications" and "software-engineering" roles, followed by specialized fields like cybersecurity and data analytics. Geographically, the data highlights Bengaluru as a major hub and suggests New York City has more tech jobs than San Francisco. Notably, the analysis excludes data from China and shows a complete absence of C#/.NET roles in its charts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's data and methodology. The most prominent criticisms focus on the data's completeness and accuracy. Users immediately questioned the geographic rankings, finding it hard to believe that Bengaluru has more openings than the entire USA or that NYC's job count is on par with Pune. Several commenters pointed out glaring omissions, most notably the complete absence of C#/.NET jobs, which they know to be prevalent in sectors like finance. The author of the post responded to some comments, clarifying that the data is "ex-China" and acknowledging that .NET jobs did exist in the dataset but fell below a certain cutoff for inclusion in the charts.

There was also a meta-discussion about the nature of the content itself. One user dismissed it as "AI generated slop," while another countered that the quality of AI output depends on the human effort and curation invested, defending the piece as a "great starting point" despite its flaws. Overall, the community treated the report as an interesting but deeply flawed and incomplete snapshot, not a reliable outlook.
