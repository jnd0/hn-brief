# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-03

## [Why users cannot create Issues directly](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3558)
**Score:** 711 | **Comments:** 263 | **ID:** 46460319

> **Article:** The linked GitHub issue explains why the Ghostty terminal project does not allow users to create issues directly. Instead, all user reports (potential bugs, questions, and feature requests) must start in the GitHub Discussions forum. The maintainers then triage these discussions; only once a report is fully understood, verified, and deemed actionable does a maintainer convert it into a formal Issue in the tracker. The stated goal is to ensure the issue list is a clean, prioritized backlog of work ready for contributors, rather than a noisy mix of user errors, configuration problems, and unrefined ideas.

## [I'm a developer for a major food delivery app](https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/)
**Score:** 564 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46461563

> **Article:** The article is a "confession" posted to Reddit by an anonymous user claiming to be a developer for a major food delivery app. The author alleges that the company intentionally manipulates the tipping system to maximize corporate profit at the expense of drivers. Specifically, they claim that the app's algorithms are designed to suppress or delay driver payouts, obscure how much of a tip actually goes to the driver, and use tips to subsidize base pay, effectively treating customer tips as part of the company's revenue rather than a direct supplement for the driver. The author states they have resigned and posted this from an anonymized connection, fully expecting legal repercussions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the post's authenticity but largely agrees that the alleged practices are plausible within the gig economy. The consensus is that while the specific story might be fabricated, it aligns with known business models of venture-backed tech companies prioritizing growth and profit over fair labor practices.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Skepticism and Plausibility:** Many users questioned the post's veracity, noting the lack of evidence and the convenient timing of the author's resignation. However, a majority felt the described behavior was entirely believable, with one user stating it's "surprising people think this is news."
*   **Systemic Issues in the Gig Economy:** The conversation quickly broadened from a single company to a critique of the entire industry. Commenters argued that the business model of food delivery apps relies on an "infinite supply of suckers" (drivers) and that such anti-user/anti-driver practices are a "typical VC/techbro company playbook."
*   **User and Driver Impact:** Several users discussed the real-world consequences. One pointed out that even if a minority of users quit in protest, the financial gain from exploiting the majority's tips would outweigh the loss. Others shared personal anecdotes of poor service, such as orders being stuck in limbo while the restaurant waits for a driver, highlighting the systemic inefficiencies.
*   **Consumer Response:** A few commenters discussed their own strategies, such as tipping in cash to bypass the app's system. However, it was noted that drivers often see the tip amount before accepting an order, creating a dilemma for customers who want to ensure good service without subsidizing the company.

## [FracturedJson](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki)
**Score:** 487 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46464235

> **Article:** FracturedJson is a tool and library for formatting JSON data into a more compact, table-like, and readable structure. It presents JSON in a 2D format where object properties are aligned in columns, making it easier to scan dense data. The project includes implementations in C# and TypeScript/JavaScript, with a Python wrapper available. It also supports JSON with comments (JSONC), a feature not present in the official JSON standard.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the utility and philosophy of FracturedJson's approach. A primary theme was the long-standing debate over JSON's lack of comment support. Many commenters were grateful that FracturedJson handles comments, calling the original reason for their exclusion (to prevent them from being used as parsing directives) "silly." However, others defended this design choice, arguing it was a deliberate move to prevent JSON from becoming as complex and misuse-prone as XML.

The tool's practical applications were widely discussed. Users immediately saw its value for improving the readability of API debug output and complex configuration files, with some noting its potential to reduce token counts for LLM processing. However, a significant counterpoint was raised that for human-edited config files, formats like TOML or YAML are generally superior, and that using FracturedJson could make `git diff` messy due to realignment.

There was also a strong desire for better tooling integration. Users expressed a wish for FracturedJson to be integrated into popular command-line tools like `jq` and for it to be usable in a standard Unix pipeline (reading from stdin). The conversation concluded with a call for a language-independent conformance test suite to ensure consistency across the different implementations and encourage adoption in more languages.

## [HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820)
**Score:** 483 | **Comments:** 253 | **ID:** 46463315

> **Article:** An article in *Eurosurveillance* details the remarkable success of the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. It shows that the prevalence of the two most oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18) has been reduced from 15-17% before vaccination to less than 1% in vaccinated women. This has led to a dramatic decline in cervical cancer rates, with Denmark approaching the WHO's threshold for disease elimination.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion overwhelmingly celebrates the Danish program as a major public health success, with commenters highlighting the dramatic drop in cervical cancer rates and the effectiveness of the national digital notification system (e-boks) for administering the vaccine.

However, the conversation quickly diversified into several key themes:
*   **Vaccine Effectiveness and Limitations:** While the vaccine has nearly eliminated targeted strains, commenters noted that a third of women still have non-vaccine HPV types. There is hope that future vaccines will cover these strains.
*   **Expanding the Message to Men:** A significant point of debate was the failure to effectively market the vaccine to men. One commenter argued that focusing messaging on male-specific cancers (penile, rectal, throat) would be more effective than focusing on female fertility. This led to a discussion about policy gaps, where men are now recommended to get the vaccine up to age 40 but are often only covered by insurance up to age 26.
*   **Data and Public Trust:** Users praised the ability to track the vaccine's effectiveness via electronic health records. Conversely, a sub-thread detailed how anti-vaccine arguments often rely on misleading data (e.g., cherry-picking studies or misrepresenting trial controls), with one user noting that a flagged anti-vaccine comment was indeed misleading.
*   **General HPV Education:** Several comments provided additional context, such as the high transmissibility of HPV (even without intercourse), the high prevalence in the general population, and the importance of vaccination for preventing throat cancers in men.

## [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
**Score:** 414 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46463644

> **Article:** The article "10 years of personal finances in plain text files" describes the author's long-term use of a plain-text accounting system, specifically Beancount, to manage their money. The author advocates for this method over traditional financial software, highlighting benefits like data ownership, version control with Git, easy searchability with standard command-line tools, and the ability to model complex financial instruments beyond simple bank transactions. The post details the author's workflow, including a directory structure with one file per year, and concludes that the system, while requiring an initial time investment, provides a robust and flexible way to maintain a complete financial picture.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive, with many users sharing their own experiences with plain-text accounting (PTA) systems like Beancount, Ledger, and hledger. The conversation revolves around several key themes:

*   **Advocacy and Benefits:** Users echo the article's main points, praising the flexibility, data ownership, and power of using plain text. They note that these systems can track far more than just money, including investments, RSUs, pensions, and even personal metrics like energy usage.

*   **The Learning Curve and Niche Appeal:** A central point of debate is the high barrier to entry. Several commenters acknowledge that PTA is not for everyone, requiring an investment of time to learn double-entry bookkeeping and the specific tool's syntax. It's seen as a niche solution for developers and power users who value control and are comfortable with a command-line interface.

*   **The Value of the Process:** Beyond the practical output, many commenters find value in the process itself. The act of manually entering and categorizing transactions forces a deeper awareness of one's financial habits, leading to better financial literacy and more informed decision-making. The time spent is framed as an investment in understanding one's own economy.

*   **Tooling and Workflow:** Users shared practical tips and tools, with a particular emphasis on the Fava web interface as a user-friendly GUI for Beancount. The use of version control (Git) for tracking changes was also mentioned as a key part of the workflow. The discussion also touched upon using LLMs to help build custom tooling for managing the data.

*   **Minor Criticism:** One comment thread raised a minor ethical point about the article's author, who wrote a book on Beancount, having very few direct contributions to the core Beancount project itself. However, other users defended the author, pointing to their extensive work creating content and tools within the Beancount ecosystem.

## [Happy Public Domain Day 2026](https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/)
**Score:** 414 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46460440

> **Article:** The article from The Public Domain Review announces that on January 1, 2026, a new set of creative works from 1930 will enter the public domain in countries with a "life plus 70 years" copyright term. This event, known as Public Domain Day, makes works published in 1930 freely available for reuse and adaptation. The article highlights several notable works entering the public domain, including the novel "The Maltese Falcon," the film "All Quiet on the Western Front," the first appearance of the character Betty Boop, and the first recordings of Duke Ellington. It also mentions literary works like "The Swallows and Amazons" and "The Good Earth," and notes that while the original character of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain in 2024, the 1930 version of "Pluto the Pup" is now also free to use.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the complexities and frustrations of modern copyright law. A central theme is the confusion over what actually becomes public domain, especially for music. One user asks how Charlie Parker's music can be public domain when his recordings involve collaborators who died more recently, leading to an explanation that the musical composition and the sound recording have separate copyrights. This complexity is met with a cynical suggestion to simply "pirate it" as copyright has become "lunacy."

The conversation also explores the practical implications of a work being in the public domain. Users discuss how this only applies to the original elements; a restored version of a film or a new translation would still be under copyright. Furthermore, it's noted that while you are free to copy a public domain work, you are not guaranteed access to it—if a rights holder controls all existing physical copies, they can effectively prevent its redistribution.

There is a significant debate about the length of copyright terms. One user proposes a system of exponentially increasing fees for copyright renewal, which is countered by the argument that this would favor wealthy corporations and harm individual authors whose works may only become popular decades after release. This leads to a sentiment that copyright should be tied to human lifespans and that its original purpose of protecting artists has been inverted. The discussion concludes with a general call for more open access to creative works, with one user expressing an ideal that "everything should be in the public domain."

## [39th Chaos Communication Congress Videos](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2025)
**Score:** 359 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46464426

> **Article:** The article links to the official media repository for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39c3), a major annual hacker conference. The page provides access to the video recordings of all talks presented at the event, covering a wide range of topics including cybersecurity, hardware hacking, privacy, and socio-political commentary on technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on sharing and evaluating specific talks from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress. A primary focus is Cory Doctorow's talk on "enshittification," which is praised for its strong critique of US trade policy and its role in forcing anti-circumvention laws on other nations. Users highlight several other popular talks, including technical deep dives on hacking Bluetooth headphones, GPG vulnerabilities, and in-house electronics manufacturing, as well as a presentation on fraud within Germany's "Deutschlandticket" system.

The conversation also delves into a notable controversy: the cancellation of a planned talk by AI researcher Joscha Bach following the public release of private emails he exchanged with Jeffrey Epstein. This sparked a debate among commenters about the nature of the allegations (which one user clarifies focus on IQ, race, and sex topics rather than abuse), the ethics of canceling a speaker over private correspondence, and the quality of Bach's public apology.

Finally, the discussion touches on the overall character of the congress. While some users express a feeling that the event is declining in technical quality, others strongly disagree by listing numerous in-depth technical talks. A separate, minor debate arises over the political nature of some talks, with one user labeling them "left-wing extremism," a characterization that is challenged by another commenter who defends antifascism as a core hacker value.

## [Standard Ebooks: Public Domain Day 2026 in Literature](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026)
**Score:** 334 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46462702

> **Article:** This article from Standard Ebooks announces the works that will enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2026. Under US copyright law, works published in 1930 will become freely available. The article highlights notable titles from that year, including Franz Kafka's *The Castle*, Agatha Christie's *Giant's Bread*, and Dashiell Hammett's *The Maltese Falcon*. It also explains the project's mission: to take these newly public domain texts and meticulously produce high-quality, beautifully designed, and professionally formatted ebook editions for everyone to enjoy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users celebrating the Standard Ebooks project for its high-quality curation and design. Key themes include:

*   **Appreciation for Quality and Curation:** Multiple users express gratitude for the project, praising the aesthetic quality of the books and noting that it has introduced them to classic literature they might not have otherwise read. The project's role as a filter for high-quality content is seen as increasingly valuable.
*   **The Complexity of Copyright:** A significant point of discussion is the confusing and often contradictory nature of international copyright law. Users share personal anecdotes of frustration, such as works being in the public domain in one country (e.g., Canada) but not another (e.g., France or the US), and the unsettling possibility of copyright being reinstated for works that had previously entered the public domain.
*   **Community and Contribution:** The thread highlights the human effort behind the project. A contributor from Standard Ebooks is present to answer questions, and another user shares their personal project of digitizing a rare, out-of-copyright book, underscoring the "selfless" work that benefits the public.
*   **Future Speculation and Tooling:** One user posits a future "cultural inflection point" where the growing volume of high-quality public domain media could rival contemporary, lower-quality content, potentially leading to new P2P platforms for classics. Others share related tools and apps that help manage and access these ebooks.

## [Parental controls aren't for parents](https://beasthacker.com/til/parental-controls-arent-for-parents.html)
**Score:** 331 | **Comments:** 352 | **ID:** 46464652

> **Article:** The article "Parental controls aren't for parents" argues that modern parental control systems are poorly designed, overly complex, and ultimately serve the tech companies rather than helping parents. The author details his frustrating experience trying to set up a safe digital environment for his son, highlighting issues like conflicting account systems (e.g., Nintendo and Microsoft for Minecraft), the inability to block free downloads on consoles like the Nintendo eShop, and the lack of granular controls on platforms like Disney+. The author contends that these systems are designed to exhaust parents into giving up, thereby creating "ideal customers" who accept default settings, subscribe to paid services, and allow unrestricted access to app stores and content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply divided on the issue of digital parenting, with debates centering on parental responsibility, the technical failings of big tech, and the societal impact of surveillance-based parenting.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the author's personal approach. Some commenters are highly critical, suggesting the author's problems stem from "ignorance" and a lack of research, pointing out that guides for setting up Nintendo controls exist and that the Gabb app guide contains explicit warnings about apps with stranger communication. Others, however, defend the author's frustration, agreeing that the systems are genuinely difficult, especially for non-technical parents, and that companies like Nintendo have a poor track record with online services.

This leads to a broader critique of the tech industry. Commenters share their own "enshittification" horror stories, such as Disney+ lacking per-show blocking and Hulu bundling unwanted influencer content. There is a consensus that these platforms are not designed with child safety as a priority, but rather to maximize engagement and revenue, making parental controls an afterthought.

The discussion then pivots to parenting philosophies, which break down into three main camps:
1.  **Tech-Assisted Monitoring:** The original author's method, which is criticized by some for outsourcing parenting to flawed software.
2.  **Direct Supervision:** One commenter advocates for never letting children use devices alone, a solution others dismiss as an unrealistic luxury in a world where schools require iPads and social life is online.
3.  **Education and Trust:** Several parents argue that communication and teaching children to be responsible digital citizens is more effective and important than any technical block.

Finally, a powerful counter-argument emerges against both tech-based and parental surveillance models. A commenter posits that growing up under constant digital control teaches children that a lack of privacy is normal, conditioning them to be unconcerned when corporations and governments later do the same. This is echoed by a user who notes the social isolation caused by strict, no-phone rules, highlighting the difficult trade-offs parents face.

## [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 294 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article (linked from the IndieWeb wiki) introduces the POSSE strategy: **P**ublish on your **O**wn **S**ite, **S**yndicate **E**lsewhere. This approach advocates for individuals to maintain ownership of their content by publishing it primarily on their personal websites or blogs, and then automatically or manually sharing (syndicating) it to third-party platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, or Substack. The core philosophy is to prioritize personal ownership and control over one's content and audience relationships, rather than relying entirely on centralized platforms that may restrict reach or claim ownership.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a return to the web's original, decentralized ideals. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Ownership and Control:** The primary motivation cited was regaining control over one's content and audience. Users argued that publishing on your own site ensures you own the "single source of truth," whereas platforms like Facebook or Medium own the content and can limit its reach or visibility.
*   **Practical Implementation:** Several users shared their personal workflows. One commenter detailed their manual process of posting to their site and then syndicating to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter, while others pointed to tools like "Posse Party" that can automate this via RSS feeds.
*   **Technical and Philosophical History:** A recurring point was the missed opportunity to build a truly distributed social web using older standards like RSS, microformats, and FOAF. There was a sense of nostalgia for a more open internet that could have competed with the rise of centralized "walled gardens."
*   **Counter-Perspectives:** Not all comments were purely supportive. One user argued that the desire for POSSE is a regression from the modern internet (specifically mentioning LLMs), suggesting a return to non-digital interactions. Another commenter pointed out the irony of discussing this on Hacker News, a centralized platform itself, though others countered that HN's model is distinct because it links out rather than trapping content. A practical warning was also issued about the non-commercial license of a popular syndication tool.

**Score:** 242 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46466074

> **Question:** This is a standard "Who is hiring?" thread on Hacker News for January 2026. It is a community-driven post where employers post job openings. The thread features a diverse range of roles, including senior software engineering positions at tech companies like Temporal (distributed systems), FetLife (DevOps), and Kadoa (AI/web scraping), as well as roles in specialized fields like energy (Piq Energy), scientific computing (Stellar Science), and academia (John Carroll University). The listings cover various employment types (remote, hybrid, on-site) and locations across the US and internationally.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion consists almost entirely of job postings from companies seeking to hire. There is no meta-discussion or chatter; each top-level comment is a job offer. The posts follow a consistent format, detailing the company, role, location, compensation (often specified), tech stack, and application instructions. A notable trend is the prevalence of roles involving AI/LLMs, either directly (Kadoa, Piq Energy) or as a desired skill (Clever Benefits). Several companies emphasize a high degree of ownership and a "full-stack" or "generalist" mindset. A few comments are simple inquiries about remote work eligibility, indicating that these threads also serve as a direct channel for candidate questions.

## [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 438 | **ID:** 46465327

> **Article:** The article, published on the 30th anniversary of the first IPv6 specification, reflects on the protocol's slow and incomplete adoption. It frames the situation not as a total failure, but as a complex transition that has taken a different path than originally envisioned. The piece notes that while IPv6 has not replaced IPv4, it has successfully absorbed the massive growth in mobile, broadband, and cloud networks, which is why the internet hasn't collapsed from a lack of IPv4 addresses. The article highlights that the primary reasons for the continued dominance of IPv4 are inertia, the entrenched complexity of legacy systems, and the widespread use of workarounds like Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT) that have delayed the perceived crisis. Ultimately, it portrays IPv6 as a necessary but only partially realized evolution, still struggling to become the default for many users and services.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply divided on the utility and future of IPv6, with perspectives often shaped by the user's specific context (e.g., enterprise network engineer vs. home hobbyist).

A central theme is the **practical experience gap**. Some engineers, particularly in large or modern networks, report that IPv6 is already dominant, carrying the majority of their internet traffic. They argue it's a quiet success where it matters most. However, this is strongly countered by many others, especially home users and self-hosters, who find IPv6 to be a source of friction. Their complaints include residential ISPs failing to offer stable prefixes, misconfigured networks, and a long tail of applications and services (including some popular games) that still lack proper IPv6 support, forcing users to maintain complex dual-stack setups or rely on IPv4-only solutions.

The discussion also features a significant **debate on privacy and security**. One prominent viewpoint argues that IPv6's design for end-to-end connectivity is a step backward for user anonymity, making devices easier to track than in an IPv4/NAT environment. However, this is countered by others who point out that privacy extensions exist to mitigate this and that other tracking methods (like browser fingerprinting) are far more significant. The security argument is two-sided: some see a dual-stack implementation as doubling the attack surface, while others believe IPv6's modern features can lead to simpler, more secure firewall rules if implemented correctly.

Finally, there is a strong sense of **ambivalence and resignation**. Many commenters feel that IPv6 adoption is a slow-moving inevitability driven by the sheer scale of mobile and IoT, but that for the average user or small-scale operator, the transition remains a low priority fraught with "janky" workarounds and a lack of clear benefits.

**Score:** 164 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46464120

> **Article:** The article "Assorted less(1) tips" provides a collection of useful, lesser-known features of the `less` command-line pager. Key tips include using `-R` for proper color rendering, `-X` to prevent clearing the screen on exit, and `-E` to automatically quit if the file's content is shorter than the terminal window. It also covers interactive features like using `&` to filter lines with regexes, `s` to save the current input to a file, and `+F` (or `F` within the session) to "follow" a file's output, similar to `tail -f`. The article also mentions the ability to customize key bindings using a `.lesskey` file and suggests alternatives like `glow` for Markdown files.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates and expands upon the article's tips, with users sharing their own favorite `less` features and alternatives. A major point of excitement is the `+F` / `F` command for following file output, which many commenters found to be a powerful alternative to `tail -f` because it allows for seamless switching between following new content and searching the existing buffer. The `s` key for saving piped output to a file was also highlighted as a highly practical tool for capturing long-running command results without pre-planning with `tee`.

Several users shared their preferred command-line flags, such as `-L` to disable pre-processing of log files (which can cause delays) and the combination `-SEXIER` for a more user-friendly experience. The discussion also touched on customization through `.lesskey` files and the use of `Ctrl-R` for literal string searching. Beyond `less`, there was significant interest in modern alternatives like `glow` (for Markdown), `ov`, and `moor`, which offer features like better rendering or improved stability.

## [A confession from a mainstream food delivery app engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/gbrh2zxeou)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46461578

> **Article:** An anonymous post on Reddit, allegedly from a food delivery app engineer, claims that several common features are deceptive. The author asserts that the "Priority Delivery" fee is a "scam" that merely sets a boolean flag which the dispatch logic ignores, and that the platform manipulates driver tips by using customer tips to subsidize base pay, effectively "stealing" them. The post also describes a toxic work culture focused on squeezing "human assets" and using data to exploit both customers and drivers for marginal gains.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the post's authenticity, with many commenters deeming it likely fake or fabricated. The primary reasons for disbelief include the author's use of a burner laptop on public Wi-Fi while simultaneously providing enough specific details to potentially dox themselves, and the implausibility of engineers being included in high-level business strategy meetings where such exploitative tactics are explicitly discussed. Commenters found this level of transparency to developers unrealistic for a large, siloed corporation.

However, many also noted that while the post itself might be fake, the unethical business practices it describes align with common user experiences and suspicions about the gig economy. Several users shared personal anecdotes confirming that "Priority Delivery" does seem to work as advertised (preventing bundled orders), contradicting the author's claim. The discussion broadened to include other grievances with these platforms, such as dynamic pricing (surge pricing, higher costs for frequent users) and the general lack of regulation. The consensus leaned towards treating the story as unsubstantiated fiction, but one that resonated with widely held beliefs about the exploitative nature of these services.

**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 25 | **ID:** 46469577

> **Article:** An article on madebywindmill.com posits that the tempo of Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" is intentionally set to 123.45 BPM. The author calculated this by measuring the total duration of the track and the number of beats within it. The article suggests this is a clever "Easter egg," a deliberate choice that thematically aligns with the song's lyrics about robotic efficiency and the narrative of the *Interstella 5555* movie, where the characters are turned into a machine-like music production unit.

## [FreeBSD: Home NAS, part 1 – configuring ZFS mirror (RAID1)](https://rtfm.co.ua/en/freebsd-home-nas-part-1-configuring-zfs-mirror-raid1/)
**Score:** 126 | **Comments:** 43 | **ID:** 46462108

> **Article:** The article is a technical guide for setting up a home NAS using FreeBSD, specifically focusing on configuring a ZFS mirror (RAID1). It walks the reader through the initial setup on a Lenovo ThinkCentre, covering disk partitioning, ZFS pool creation, and dataset configuration. The guide is presented as the first part of a series, aimed at users who want to build a robust, ZFS-based storage server from scratch.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with users expressing a strong appetite for more content on FreeBSD, ZFS, and the native hypervisor, bhyve. A key theme was the appeal of this software stack for users seeking a powerful, systemd-free alternative to Linux-based solutions like Proxmox.

Several technical points were debated and elaborated on:
*   **ECC Memory and ZFS:** One commenter noted the lack of ECC memory in the recommended hardware, sparking a brief but common debate. The consensus was that while ECC is ideal for preventing data corruption from memory errors, ZFS's checksumming is still highly valuable, and other filesystems are equally susceptible to such errors.
*   **ZFS Boot Environments:** A highly-valued feature, borrowed from Solaris, was highlighted. This allows users to create snapshots of the system before applying updates or patches. If an update fails, they can simply roll back to the previous "boot environment," making system maintenance much safer and more reliable.
*   **ZFS for Home Users:** A central question was whether ZFS is worth the complexity for a casual home user. The prevailing opinion was that it is, primarily for its data integrity features (checksums that warn of failing drives or cables) and its cheap, efficient snapshots, which provide an excellent local backup and versioning system. Commenters argued that software RAID like ZFS is also superior to hardware RAID for home use due to better portability and flexibility.
*   **Related Technologies:** The conversation also touched upon related concepts in other systems, such as NixOS's "system generations" and Android's A/B updates, which solve similar problems of atomic updates and rollbacks.

Overall, the discussion reflected a community of enthusiasts and power users who see FreeBSD with ZFS as a compelling, reliable, and flexible platform for a home server.

## [A small collection of text-only websites](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/)
**Score:** 124 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46463635

> **Article:** The article "A small collection of text-only websites" showcases a curated list of websites that prioritize content over presentation. These sites use minimal to no CSS, often serving content in plain text formats (like .txt) or through simple HTML. The author highlights examples such as Daring Fireball's .text version, NPR's text-only site, and various personal blogs, framing them as a refreshing alternative to the modern, often bloated, web.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to the post, with users expanding the list and exploring the concept of text-only web design. Several commenters provided additional examples of lightweight sites, including CNN's "lite" version and the historically minimalist Berkshire Hathaway site. There was a notable discussion on the practical applications of text-only formats, such as using `.json` or `.txt` extensions for API-like access or to simplify data serialization in web apps.

Many users connected the trend to nostalgia for the early web, recalling the era of "printer-friendly" versions and noting how poorly modern sites handle printing. A specific historical anecdote was shared about CNN switching to a text-only version on 9/11 to handle traffic. The conversation also touched upon related protocols like Gemini and Gopher, and some debate arose over the definition of "text-only," with one user distinguishing between truly plain text sites and those that are merely minimally styled.

## [Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone](https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03)
**Score:** 119 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46466364

> **Article:** Punkt. has unveiled the MC03, a new "premium secure smartphone" priced at €700. The device is notable for its subscription-based business model, which requires a mandatory €10/month fee to maintain full functionality. The company's marketing frames this as a privacy feature, stating, "If you don’t pay for a product, you are the product," and positioning the subscription as a way for users to "pay to retain your data rather than paying with it." The subscription is intended to fund core services, security updates, and privacy features, distinguishing the model from "free" OSes that monetize user data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction to the Punkt. MC03 is overwhelmingly negative, with commenters expressing skepticism and criticism on several fronts.

The primary point of contention is the subscription model. Many users find it unacceptable to pay a recurring fee for a device they have purchased, viewing it as "Phone-as-a-Service" rather than true ownership. The company's privacy justification was met with cynicism, with one user calling it "virtue signaling." However, a dissenting opinion emerged, arguing that paying for OS development is a more transparent and sustainable model than the hidden costs in mainstream devices or the unreliability of FOSS donations.

The product's value proposition was heavily questioned. Commenters struggled to see the target audience for a €700 phone that is "locked down" and cut off from major app stores, especially when compared to more established privacy-focused alternatives like GrapheneOS. A user brought up a critical post from the GrapheneOS team, which claimed that Punkt.'s OS is a heavily outdated fork of their project with inferior security and features.

The discussion broadened into a larger debate on tech independence. One commenter detailed their plan to build a portable, Linux-based system to completely leave the "phone" ecosystem, arguing that true freedom requires breaking away from corporate-controlled gardens. This reflects a deep-seated frustration with the current state of consumer devices. Ultimately, the consensus is that the MC03 fails to deliver on its promise of privacy and ownership, offering "same walls, different garden."
