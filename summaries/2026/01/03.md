# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-03

## [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 577 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article (via the IndieWeb wiki) introduces POSSE (Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), a strategy for taking control of one's online presence. The core principle is to publish content first on a personal website that you own and control, and then copy or "syndicate" that content to third-party platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, or Medium. This approach ensures that the user retains ownership of their original content and is not solely dependent on the longevity or policies of centralized social media platforms. It is presented as a way to reclaim ownership and agency on the internet.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a return to the web's original ideals of personal ownership and decentralization. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Practical Implementation and Tools:** Users shared their personal experiences with POSSE, with one commenter noting they manually cross-post from their site to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter. Automation was identified as a key challenge, and tools like PosseParty.com were mentioned as potential solutions that can syndicate from a site's RSS/Atom feed.
*   **Ownership vs. Platform Control:** A major point of agreement was that POSSE re-establishes the user's website as the "single source of truth," countering the model of platforms like Facebook that own and control user content. Some argued this is a direct response to platforms that may penalize external links.
*   **Broader Philosophical and Counter-arguments:** While most were supportive, a few comments offered different perspectives. One user argued that the desire for this model is a nostalgic reaction to the concentration of power in big tech and LLMs, suggesting a more radical step away from digital life altogether. Another commenter countered that the internet remains vital for connecting people with niche interests, and the core issue is ownership, not the existence of the platforms.
*   **Historical Context:** Some commenters lamented that the web missed an opportunity to build a truly distributed social graph using older standards like RSS and microformats, which would have made this model seamless.

## [FracturedJson](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki)
**Score:** 535 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46464235

> **Article:** FracturedJson is a tool and library for formatting JSON data into a more readable, two-dimensional, table-like structure. Instead of the standard nested indentation, it aligns elements vertically, making it easier to scan large arrays of objects or complex data structures. The project is implemented in C# and TypeScript/JavaScript, with a Python wrapper also available. It supports JSON with comments (JSONC) and can be used as a library or a command-line interface (CLI) that reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the practical utility of the tool, the long-standing debate over comments in JSON, and the choice of data formats for human-editable files.

A primary theme was the debate over JSON's lack of comments. One side argued that Douglas Crockford's decision was wise, citing Hyrum's Law and the risk of JSON becoming as complex as XML if comments were allowed. The other side found the reasoning "silly" and pointed out that the real-world need for comments is undeniable, leading to the widespread use of non-standard JSONC.

The tool's potential use cases were widely discussed. Comment support makes it appealing for debug output or game development configs. However, several commenters cautioned against using it for human-readable configuration files, arguing that formats like TOML or YAML are better suited for that purpose (with some humorous anti-YAML sentiment included). The ability to pipe data through the CLI was highlighted as a key feature, especially for integration with tools like `jq`.

Finally, a notable suggestion was made to create a language-independent conformance test suite to ensure consistency across the different implementations (C#, JS, etc.). This would help the ecosystem grow and maintain reliability. A tangential but interesting point was raised about the format's potential efficiency with Large Language Models (LLMs), as the structured formatting could reduce token counts.

## [HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820)
**Score:** 528 | **Comments:** 298 | **ID:** 46463315

> **Article:** An article in *Eurosurveillance* details the remarkable success of the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. The study shows that the prevalence of the two most oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18) has been reduced from 16% to less than 1% in the vaccinated female population. This has led to a dramatic decline in cervical cancer rates, with Denmark now meeting the WHO's threshold for elimination of the disease.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is broadly positive about the scientific findings and the public health achievement, but also explores several related themes:

*   **Success and Broader Benefits:** Commenters celebrate the program's success, with one noting the dramatic drop in cervical cancer rates in Denmark. Several users emphasize that the benefits for men are under-promoted, citing reductions in penile, rectal, and particularly nasopharyngeal (throat) cancers. There's a consensus that public messaging has failed to adequately target men and boys.

*   **Vaccine Strain Replacement:** A key scientific concern raised is the potential for "strain replacement." While the vaccine has nearly eliminated HPV 16/18, one-third of women still have infections with other high-risk HPV types. Users speculate whether these non-vaccine strains will become more prevalent, hoping for future vaccines to target them.

*   **Vaccine Safety and Misinformation:** A sub-thread discusses a flagged comment containing anti-vaccine misinformation. A user who investigated the flagged post explains how it used misleading tactics, such as cherry-picking data and omitting crucial context from clinical trials. This leads to a broader point that public health agencies' failure to transparently communicate complex issues (like vaccine efficacy in those with pre-existing infections) creates openings for misinformation to thrive.

*   **Access and Policy:** Practical issues of vaccine access were raised, particularly for men. In some regions, the vaccine is recommended up to age 40 but only covered by insurance up to 26, creating a gap where a generation of men is expected to pay out-of-pocket.

*   **Administrative Infrastructure:** The role of Denmark's digital infrastructure (e.g., a national digital post system) was debated. While some argued it was key to the program's success, others countered that similar vaccination rates are achieved in countries without such systems, suggesting it's helpful but not essential.

## [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
**Score:** 462 | **Comments:** 170 | **ID:** 46463644

> **Article:** The article "10 years of personal finances in plain text files" details the author's long-term use of a plain-text accounting system, specifically Beancount, to manage their money. The author advocates for this method over traditional budgeting apps, highlighting benefits such as data ownership, unlimited flexibility, and the ability to model complex financial situations (like investments, RSUs, and pensions) that commercial software often fails to capture. The post walks through their workflow, including how they structure their files (one per year) and automate transaction importing from bank CSVs. The author acknowledges the high initial setup cost and learning curve but argues that the long-term benefits of having a fully customizable and future-proof financial record are well worth the effort.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely validated the author's approach, with many users sharing their own positive experiences using Beancount or similar plain-text accounting (PTA) tools like Ledger and hledger. The discussion revolved around several key themes:

*   **The Power of Plain Text:** Users celebrated the core benefits of this approach: data ownership, longevity, searchability with standard tools (grep), and version control with Git. This method avoids vendor lock-in and ensures data remains accessible for decades.
*   **The Learning Curve and Niche Appeal:** A major point of discussion was the significant barrier to entry. Newcomers noted the need to learn double-entry bookkeeping and the various PTA tools. While some argued this approach is only for a niche of developers and power users, others countered that the deep financial awareness gained from the process is a valuable reward in itself.
*   **Workflow and Tooling:** Participants shared practical tips, such as splitting large files by year to maintain performance and using the Fava web interface as a GUI frontend for a better overview. The use of LLMs to help build custom tooling for managing the data was also mentioned as a modern enhancement to the workflow.
*   **Time Commitment:** The article's mention of spending 30-45 minutes per month was debated. One user calculated the total hours over a decade, while others defended the time as a worthwhile investment for the financial clarity and control it provides.

**Score:** 447 | **Comments:** 304 | **ID:** 46471199

> **Article:** The article "2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop" is a personal manifesto declaring the author's intent to switch their daily driver operating system from Windows to Linux. The author cites a "death by a thousand cuts" of frustrations with modern Windows, including performance degradation, bloatware, intrusive ads, and a general sense that the OS is working against the user. They contrast this with the perceived benefits of Linux: user control, performance on older hardware, and a more principled computing experience. The post is framed as a forward-looking resolution to make the switch permanent in the coming year.

## [Daft Punk Easter Egg in the BPM Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?](https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/)
**Score:** 418 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46469577

> **Article:** An article on Made By Windmill analyzes the tempo of Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger." The author noticed that the song's BPM is not a standard integer but is instead remarkably close to 123.45. They used audio analysis software to measure the duration of 445 beats, which yielded a BPM of 123.453. The article posits that this is a deliberate "Easter egg" by the famously meticulous duo, a numerically precise and clever detail hidden within the track.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with great enthusiasm to the article, treating the BPM as a likely intentional Easter egg. The most upvoted comment, by altairprime, provides a deep thematic analysis, linking the 123.45 BPM to the song's music video and its role in the *Interstella 5555* movie. The commenter argues that this machine-like, "manager-entered" tempo perfectly symbolizes the song's narrative of the band being abducted and forced to become robotic music producers.

The discussion then evolved into a "red string" mathematical debate. While the original article's calculation was questioned, this inspired further speculation. Altairprime returned with a more elaborate theory, suggesting the true BPM might be 123.4567, which would align with the song having exactly 456 beats and a 0.2345-second silence at the start, adding another layer of numerological fun.

Other key discussion points included:
*   **Comparisons to other artists**, citing similar Easter eggs from Aphex Twin and Venetian Snares.
*   A **side discussion on the original sample**, "Cola Bottle Baby" by Edwin Birdsong.
*   A debate on the **technical realities of electronic music production**, with several users correcting a claim that all electronic music has a perfectly steady tempo, pointing out the common challenges of MIDI sync, latency, and jitter.
*   A brief meta-discussion about a user being accused of writing a comment with AI, which was defended by others as a simple, human-written post.

## [39th Chaos Communication Congress Videos](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2025)
**Score:** 383 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46464426

> **Article:** The article links to the official media repository for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39c3), a major annual hacker conference held in Hamburg, Germany. The page provides access to the video recordings of the various talks and presentations delivered at the event. The content covers a wide range of topics relevant to the hacker community, including cybersecurity, hardware reverse-engineering, digital rights, and the political landscape of technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around highlighting specific talks and debating the conference's overall themes and quality. A significant portion of the comments focuses on a keynote speech by author Cory Doctorow, titled "A Post-American Enshittification-Resistant Internet." Users praise the talk for its strong critique of US tech dominance and its analysis of how American trade policy has forced other nations to adopt laws that benefit Big Tech at the expense of their own citizens and economies. The provided transcript excerpt, which illustrates this dynamic, is a key point of interest.

Beyond Doctorow's talk, the community shares and recommends other popular sessions. These include technical deep dives such as "Hacking the GPG," "Bluetooth Headphone Jacking," and an inspiring talk on "In-house electronics manufacturing from scratch." There is also a notable discussion around the cancellation of a talk by AI researcher Joscha Bach, which was pulled after his private emails with Jeffrey Epstein (concerning topics of IQ, race, and gender) were made public. Commenters debate the ethics of canceling a speaker over private correspondence versus public statements.

Finally, the discussion touches on the identity and quality of the CCC itself. While some attendees express concern that the conference is declining in technical depth, others vigorously defend the quality of the talks listed. A political undercurrent is also present, with a debate emerging over the inclusion of explicitly anti-fascist talks, which some users label as "left-wing extremism" while others argue that antifascism is a core tenet of the hacker ethos, which is inherently anti-authoritarian.

## [Parental controls aren't for parents](https://beasthacker.com/til/parental-controls-arent-for-parents.html)
**Score:** 373 | **Comments:** 390 | **ID:** 46464652

> **Article:** The article "Parental controls aren't for parents" argues that parental control systems are intentionally designed to be difficult and ineffective, serving the business interests of tech companies rather than the needs of families. The author uses personal anecdotes, particularly with a Nintendo Switch and the Gabb app store, to illustrate how these systems are convoluted. They contend that platforms force parents into a "deal" where enabling a single desired feature (like online multiplayer for Minecraft) requires accepting a host of undesirable ones (like an unfiltered eShop). The author frames this friction as a deliberate strategy to exhaust parents into giving up, thereby creating "ideal customers" who passively accept default settings, subscriptions, and in-app purchases. The piece concludes that these controls are not tools for parents, but rather mechanisms for companies to maintain control and monetize children's attention.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide in how parents approach technology, centering on the balance between technical solutions and personal responsibility. A primary theme is the critique of the original article's premise. Many commenters, like GaryBluto, argue that the author's frustrations stem from a lack of research, pointing out that solutions for the Nintendo Switch exist and that app stores like Gabb do provide warnings. This leads to a broader debate about the role of parental controls versus active parenting. One camp advocates for direct supervision and education, with one user describing a "no solo activity" rule. However, this approach is challenged by others who call it an unrealistic luxury in a world where schools use iPads and social life is managed online.

Another significant thread addresses the technical failings and "enshittification" of platforms. Users share frustrations with specific services, such as Disney+ lacking per-show blocking or Roblox being a "minefield." The Nintendo Switch's confusing account systems and the eShop's "softcore" games are highlighted as examples of corporate negligence, with some attributing this to Nintendo's historical incompetence with online services.

Finally, the discussion touches on the long-term societal effects of constant surveillance. One commenter posits that growing up under total parental control creates adults who are indifferent to privacy violations by corporations and governments. The conversation also explores the social consequences of restrictive policies, with some defending "no phone until 16" rules while others share personal experiences of being socially isolated as a result. Ultimately, the consensus leans towards a hybrid approach: using technical controls as a baseline but emphasizing constant communication, education, and adaptation as the most critical tools for parenting in the digital age.

## [Standard Ebooks: Public Domain Day 2026 in Literature](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026)
**Score:** 358 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46462702

> **Article:** This article from Standard Ebooks announces the works that will enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2026. Under US copyright law, works published in 1930 will become freely available. The article highlights notable titles from that year, including Agatha Christie's *The Murder at the Vicarage*, Kafka's *The Castle*, and Dashiell Hammett's *The Maltese Falcon*. To celebrate, Standard Ebooks has released high-quality, modern digital editions of several of these newly available books, showcasing their meticulous process of formatting, proofreading, and cover design.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely positive, with users praising the Standard Ebooks project for its high-quality editions and for making classic literature accessible. Several contributors and users share details about the effort involved, from the editorial work on specific titles to the manual cleanup required even with modern OCR technology.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Copyright Complexity:** A significant point of debate is the complexity of international copyright law. Users point out that the article only applies to the US, and provide examples of works that are public domain in one country (e.g., Canada, the US) but still copyrighted in another (e.g., France), highlighting the confusion and limitations for global access.
*   **The Value of Curation:** A user posits a "cultural inflection point" where the growing volume of high-quality public domain content will become a more reliable alternative to the "AI slop" of contemporary media, with time acting as the ultimate quality filter.
*   **Technical and Legal Nuances:** The conversation touches on related topics, such as the distinction between a book and its film adaptation in copyright law, the murky legalities of "donating" purchased digital books to libraries, and the challenges of sourcing and designing book covers for public domain editions.
*   **Community Projects:** The thread serves as a hub for related projects, with users sharing links to tools for managing personal ebook libraries and personal blogs comparing different public domain ebook sources.

## [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
**Score:** 336 | **Comments:** 674 | **ID:** 46465327

> **Article:** The article, published on the 30th anniversary of the first IPv6 specification, reflects on the protocol's slow and incomplete adoption. It frames the situation not as a total failure, but as a complex transition that has taken a different path than originally envisioned. The piece highlights that while IPv6 has not replaced IPv4 on the desktop, it has become critical in high-growth sectors like mobile networks, broadband, and cloud infrastructure, where it has successfully absorbed the pressure of new device growth. The article also touches on the economic consequences of IPv4's persistence, noting that the scarcity of IPv4 addresses has created a secondary market where they are bought, sold, and rented like a commodity, creating a financial incentive for some to delay the switch.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide between IPv6's large-scale success and its persistent friction for individual users and smaller operators. A central theme is the contrast between massive, largely invisible adoption in mobile and enterprise networks—where some engineers report over 75% of traffic is already IPv6—and the frustrating experience of hobbyists and home users. Many commenters share their difficulties, citing residential ISPs that refuse to provide static IPv6 prefixes, applications or games that lack proper support, and the general complexity of managing a dual-stack environment.

This leads to a strong current of resistance and skepticism. Some users proudly declare they will keep IPv6 disabled, arguing it's unnecessary or even undesirable. A key point of contention is privacy; one commenter argued that IPv6's routability makes users easier to track, a view that was largely refuted by others who pointed out that IPv4's Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT) offers similar "casual anonymity" and that browser fingerprinting is a far greater threat regardless of the protocol.

Despite the frustrations, there was a clear sense that IPv6 is an inevitability, particularly driven by the sheer scale of mobile and future IoT devices. The discussion concluded with a practical workaround for the lack of ISP-provided static IPv6 prefixes: using dynamic DNS update scripts to keep DNS records current.

## [Clicks Communicator](https://www.clicksphone.com/en/communicator)
**Score:** 314 | **Comments:** 205 | **ID:** 46467057

> **Article:** The article links to the product page for "Clicks Communicator," a physical QWERTY keyboard case designed for modern smartphones (specifically iPhone and Android models). It aims to bring back the tactile typing experience of classic devices like the BlackBerry. The product connects via USB-C or Lightning port, features backlighting, includes a dedicated "Command" key for shortcuts, and promises not to obscure the phone's screen. It is marketed as a tool for faster, more accurate typing and increased productivity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is largely positive, driven by nostalgia for physical keyboards (specifically BlackBerry and Palm Treo) and frustration with modern touchscreen typing. Many users express that they never adapted to glass keyboards and struggle with autocorrect, viewing this product as a potential solution for efficiency and productivity.

However, the discussion also explores the product's practical limitations and potential. There is a debate over whether this should be a "main device" or a niche accessory; some argue that without the ability to remove addictive apps like TikTok, it remains a secondary tool, while others believe the keyboard itself is enough of a differentiator to justify the purchase. Technical users expressed interest in the hardware but questioned its utility for coding, noting the lack of essential keys like Ctrl and arrows, and a strong desire for custom OS support (Linux, GrapheneOS) was voiced, contingent on an unlocked bootloader.

## [Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet](https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46471081

> **Article:** Neowin reports that Microsoft has quietly discontinued the official method for activating Windows 11 and 10 without an internet connection. Specifically, the company has removed the "Windows 10/11 Activation Troubleshooter" feature that allowed users with digital licenses to reactivate their OS after a hardware change, provided they could sign into their Microsoft account. This move effectively closes the official loophole for offline activation, forcing users to have an internet connection to manage their licenses.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant frustration and cynicism, viewing this change as another example of Microsoft's increasing hostility towards users. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Migration to Linux:** Many commenters cited this as the "final straw" pushing them toward Linux distributions like Debian and Mint. They argued that Linux is now a viable alternative, especially for gaming, and that Microsoft's restrictive policies are driving users away.
*   **User Contempt:** A prevailing sentiment is that Microsoft treats its customers with contempt. Users shared personal anecdotes of licenses deactivating due to hardware changes and receiving unhelpful support, suggesting the company's primary goal is to force new purchases rather than assist existing users.
*   **Corporate Strategy:** Commenters lamented the decline of a more user-friendly Microsoft, comparing the current situation to the more straightforward era of Windows 2000. The general consensus is that the company is prioritizing control and monetization over user experience, leading to a "clumsy, slow" OS.
*   **Workarounds and Alternatives:** While some discussed potential technical workarounds (like the "double install trick"), the overall tone was one of resignation. Many expressed a desire to abandon the platform entirely, viewing the constant friction as not worth the effort.

## [Assorted less(1) tips](https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46464120

> **Article:** The article "Assorted less(1) tips" is a guide to getting more out of the `less` command-line pager. It covers a range of tips, from basic usability to more advanced features. Key tips include using `-R` for color handling, `-X` to prevent clearing the screen on exit, and `-E` to quit automatically if the file is shorter than one screen. It also highlights powerful interactive features like using `&` to filter lines with regexes, `s` to save the current file or pipe output to a new file, and the `+F` flag (or pressing `F` inside `less`) to "follow" a file's output, similar to `tail -f`. The article also mentions the `~/.lesskey` file for custom keybindings and the `-L` flag to disable pre-processing of input, which is useful for log files.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates and expands upon the article's tips, with users sharing their own essential `less` configurations and discovering new features. A major theme is the power of `less` for following live data; users enthusiastically discussed the `+F` / `F` command, with one expressing frustration for not knowing it could be used mid-session. The interactive filtering capabilities (`&` and `&!`) were also highlighted as a key advantage over piping to `grep`, especially for exploratory log analysis.

Several commenters shared their preferred command-line flags, such as `-X` to avoid screen clearing, and the combination `-E` and `-X` (with one user humorously noting their go-to is `-SEXIER` for mnemonic purposes). The ability to save output with the `s` key was praised as a cleaner alternative to `tee` when the output's usefulness is uncertain. The discussion also touched on customization via `~/.lesskey` and the frustration of its absence on macOS. Finally, users mentioned alternatives like `glow` (for Markdown), `ov`, and `moor`, and noted that many of `less`'s search and navigation conventions are intuitive for Vim users.

## [Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams](https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 205 | **ID:** 46467677

> **Article:** The article "Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams" proposes a technical solution to the problem of academic cheating in the age of generative AI. The author argues that since AI makes it trivial to cheat on traditional take-home assignments and even written exams, educators must pivot to methods that verify genuine understanding. The proposed solution is to use AI agents to conduct scalable, randomized oral exams.

The system works by having an AI voice agent interview students via webcam. The exam questions are generated live based on a specific skill set, ensuring that each student gets a unique set of questions, making it difficult to share answers. The AI probes the student with follow-up questions to test for deep understanding, rather than just surface-level recall. The author presents this as a low-cost (citing a cost of ~$0.42 per student), automated, and effective way to ensure students have actually mastered the material they've submitted for their coursework. The goal is to use AI to restore integrity to the educational assessment process.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a deeply skeptical and often critical reaction to the proposed AI oral exam system. While acknowledging the severity of the cheating problem, most commenters find the proposed solution dystopian, flawed, and a symptom of a deeper crisis in education rather than a viable fix.

The core themes of the discussion are:

*   **Dehumanization and Student Experience:** A primary concern is the impersonal and stressful nature of being "grilled by an AI." Many commenters express empathy for students, arguing that high-stakes assessments should be conducted by humans to maintain respect and dignity. Some shared personal anecdotes about the anxiety of oral exams with intimidating professors, but felt an AI would be even worse. The general sentiment is that this approach feels disrespectful and reduces the student to a data point.

*   **The Arms Race of Cheating:** Several users point out the fundamental flaw that this system is already obsolete. They argue that students will simply use their own AI agents (with text-to-speech and speech-to-text) to answer the AI examiner's questions, leading to a "chatbot vs. chatbot" scenario. Others noted that even with a webcam, cheating is possible with teleprompters, bone conduction microphones, and smart glasses. The discussion concludes that any remote, unsupervised assessment is ultimately gameable.

*   **Questioning the Premise of Education:** The proposal sparked a deeper philosophical debate about the purpose of education. Commenters asked, "If you can use AI to teach and test, why not just use the AI to accomplish the goal directly?" This highlights a potential paradigm shift where the value of human learning and certification is questioned. Some suggested that if AI can do everything, perhaps the entire educational model needs to be rethought, moving away from traditional assessment altogether.

*   **Skepticism and Cynicism:** There was widespread cynicism about the practicalities. Commenters were doubtful that professors would adopt this en masse, but also cynical that they would, primarily to save time and effort ("spend the 20 hours gained scrolling on their phone"). The overall tone was one of rejection, with many viewing the scheme as "mega cringe" and a "shitty program" rather than an elegant solution.

*   **Alternative Solutions:** In contrast to the high-tech proposal, several commenters advocated for simpler, low-tech solutions like in-person written exams, supervised digital tests, or smaller, human-led oral exams, which they argued were more effective and respectful.

## [Jank Lang Hit Alpha](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 23 | **ID:** 46468517

> **Article:** The article announces the "Alpha" release of jank, a new programming language. jank aims to be a native, compiled Clojure dialect that integrates seamlessly with the C++ ecosystem. It is presented as a "Clojure, but compiled to native code" solution, designed to be a drop-in replacement for Clojure on the JVM while offering high performance and interoperability with existing C/C++ libraries. The project has a comprehensive book available at book.jank-lang.org to guide early adopters.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community received the announcement with excitement and curiosity. The discussion centered on a few key areas:

*   **Language Features and Philosophy:** Users inquired about the language's type system. It was clarified that jank is dynamically typed, like its parent language Clojure, but the author has expressed future interest in adding optional gradual typing. There was also a question about compatibility, with the author confirming the goal is to be a "drop-in replacement" that tracks Clojure closely, similar to how ClojureScript relates to Clojure.

*   **Development and Tooling:** A user asked about the state of development tooling, specifically for Emacs. The author responded that a working nREPL server exists but is not yet merged due to a Clang compiler bug, identifying this as a high-priority item.

*   **Community Engagement:** Several comments offered constructive feedback, such as pointing out grammatical errors and a broken link in the project's accompanying book. The author was responsive, confirming the link was fixed and welcoming feedback. The overall tone was supportive, with users expressing enthusiasm for the project's progress.

> **Discussion:** The commenters engaged in a philosophical and psychological debate about why people play the lottery despite the overwhelming odds against them. The consensus is that players are not buying a statistical chance of winning, but rather "hope" or a brief fantasy. Users noted that the week-long wait for a drawing is where the real "product" is sold, allowing for dopamine release and daydreaming that helps people cope with daily life.

Several users suggested improvements to the site, such as tracking a running financial balance to visualize the net loss over time, or adding a "buy ticket" button to simulate the cost of playing. There was also a discussion on the ethics of lotteries, with some pointing out that they fund public programs (like education), while others argued that they function as a regressive tax on the poor. Ultimately, the project served as a reminder for many commenters of the futility of playing, while others argued that "bad odds are still better than zero odds."

## [Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal](https://unixv4.dev/)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46468283

> **Article:** The article links to a website, `unixv4.dev`, which provides a live, interactive terminal session emulating a PDP-11 running the original Unix v4 from 1973. The site allows users to directly experience this piece of computing history in their browser. It includes a disclaimer that sessions may be logged for educational and debugging purposes, and that IP addresses are collected.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, though much of it was inaccessible due to the site being "hugged to death" by the traffic, with many users encountering rate limits and timeouts.

Key themes included:
*   **Trust and Security:** A primary debate revolved around the service's trustworthiness. One commenter raised concerns about the lack of open-source code, questioning where user data was going. Others countered that the threat model for a curiosity-driven PDP-11 emulator is minimal and it's "okay to have fun."
*   **Legality and Licensing:** The legality of hosting the old Unix code was questioned. However, a commenter clarified that Caldera licensed research Unix versions 7 and earlier under a BSD-style license in 2002, making such projects legally permissible.
*   **Technical Implementation and Nostalgia:** Users discussed the technical aspects, with one offering to contribute a period-correct browser-based terminal emulator. Another shared a link to a blog post about a buffer overflow vulnerability in the original Unix v4 code, sparking a discussion on the history of exploit techniques.

## [Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone](https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46466364

> **Article:** Punkt. has unveiled the MC03, a €700 smartphone that operates on a subscription model. The device requires a €10/month subscription to its "AphyOS" operating system to maintain full functionality, including core services, privacy features, and security updates. The company's marketing frames this as a privacy feature, stating, "If you don’t pay for a product, you are the product," and positioning the subscription as a way to pay to retain your data rather than paying with it. The OS is a fork of Android (AOSP) that is locked down to a curated set of applications, though it appears to be more open than their previous devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction to the Punkt. MC03 is overwhelmingly negative, with commenters expressing skepticism and criticism on several fronts.

The primary point of contention is the subscription model itself. Many users are put off by the idea of paying a recurring fee to maintain full control over hardware they have purchased, with some calling it "Phone-as-a-Service" and a "locked garden." The marketing claim that this model protects user privacy was met with cynicism, as a mandatory subscription creates a direct financial relationship and potential dependency on the company.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the OS. There were accusations that AphyOS is an outdated fork of GrapheneOS, a claim GrapheneOS itself has made. In response, some commenters noted that Punkt.'s own materials only mention AOSP, not GrapheneOS. This controversy, combined with the locked-down nature of the OS, led many to question who the target audience is, arguing that privacy-conscious users capable of paying for such a device would prefer to use a more open and self-manageable OS like GrapheneOS or a custom Linux setup.

The discussion also branched into broader themes of digital autonomy. One commenter detailed their plan to build a portable, Linux-based system to completely escape the "phone" paradigm and avoid subscription models. Others debated the viability of paying for software, with some arguing that while paying for privacy is a valid concept, this specific execution feels exploitative and lacks transparency about where the subscription revenue goes. The consensus was that the MC03 fails to deliver on its promise of breaking free from the existing tech ecosystem, instead offering "the same walls, different garden."

## [A small collection of text-only websites](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46463635

> **Article:** The article, "A small collection of text-only websites," celebrates websites that prioritize plain text over complex design and heavy assets. It highlights a curated list of sites that are minimalist, fast-loading, and often offer dedicated text-only or "lite" versions (e.g., Daring Fireball's `.text` extension, NPR's text site). The author presents this as a return to the web's roots, focusing on content and accessibility, and contrasts these with modern, often bloated, web design.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing appreciation for the minimalist approach and sharing related examples. The conversation quickly expands beyond the article's list. Several key themes emerge:

*   **More Examples:** Users contribute additional text-only or "lite" sites, particularly for news, such as `lite.cnn.com`, `text.npr.org`, and `cbc.ca/lite`. The classic financial site `berkshirehathaway.com` is also praised for its timeless, simple design.
*   **Nostalgia and History:** Commenters recall an era when "printer-friendly" versions of websites were common. One user vividly remembers CNN switching to a text-only version on 9/11 to handle extreme traffic, a stark contrast to today's resource-heavy sites.
*   **Technical Implementation:** A developer discusses their practice of providing `.json` or `.txt` endpoints for their web apps, which benefits both power users and enforces clean data models. The discussion also touches on the history of Markdown, with a specific mention of how Daring Fireball uses the `.text` extension.
*   **Philosophy and Critique:** The conversation touches on the philosophy of web design, with one user noting that Berkshire Hathaway's consistency shows a company that "knows what business it's in." There is also a minor critique of the term "text-only," with a user pointing out that some linked sites are just minimally styled HTML/CSS rather than truly plain text. A humorous tangent briefly discusses the name "Gemini" for the alternative internet protocol.
