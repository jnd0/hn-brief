**Score:** 530 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46464235

> **Article:** FracturedJson is a tool and library designed to format JSON data into a more readable, 2D "table-like" structure. It presents JSON arrays of similar objects in a compact, aligned format that resembles a spreadsheet or a data table, while still being valid JSON. The project includes implementations in C# and TypeScript/JavaScript, as well as a command-line interface. The core idea is to enhance human readability for data-heavy JSON files without sacrificing machine-parsability.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was broadly positive, with users appreciating the improved readability for certain data structures. A central theme was the perennial debate about comments in JSON. Many commenters supported FracturedJson's inclusion of comments, arguing that the original JSON specification's omission was overly restrictive, though others defended the decision as a necessary way to prevent misuse and feature creep, contrasting it with XML's complexity.

Several users expressed a strong desire for integration with existing tools, particularly `jq`, and for the ability to pipe data through a CLI, which was confirmed to be supported. While the format was praised for its clarity, there was a caution against using it for general human-editable configuration files, with many suggesting TOML or YAML as more suitable alternatives for that purpose. One commenter also noted that the format's compactness could be beneficial for LLM token efficiency, though another pointed out that minified JSON would be even more token-efficient. Finally, a sub-thread emerged about the value of language-independent conformance test suites for ensuring consistency across the different implementations of the formatter.

## [HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820)
**Score:** 519 | **Comments:** 298 | **ID:** 46463315

> **Article:** An article in *Eurosurveillance* details the remarkable success of the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. The vaccine has nearly eliminated the prevalence of the most oncogenic HPV strains (16 and 18) in vaccinated women, reducing their presence from a baseline of 16% to less than 1%. This has led to a dramatic decline in cervical cancer rates, with the incidence falling below the WHO's threshold for disease elimination, particularly among young women.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is broadly positive about the vaccine's effectiveness but delves into several key areas: the scope of its benefits, challenges in public health communication, and the practicalities of vaccination programs.

There was a strong consensus that the public health messaging has been a failure. Several users argued that the focus on cervical cancer and female fertility ignores the significant benefits for men, who are also at risk for HPV-related cancers of the throat, penis, and rectum. One commenter suggested that a more direct message about these risks for men would dramatically increase vaccination rates.

The discussion also touched upon the evolution of the virus. While the vaccine is highly effective against its target strains, some noted that non-vaccine HPV types remain prevalent. This led to a debate on whether these other strains will become dominant, highlighting the ongoing need for vaccine development.

A significant portion of the conversation centered on public trust and misinformation. One user reported that a comment citing an anti-vaccine blog was flagged, which sparked a debate about censorship versus moderation. Another user deconstructed the misleading blog post, explaining how it selectively presented data to create a false narrative about vaccine risks. This sub-thread highlighted a tension in how to handle misinformation: while some users feel that any questioning is suppressed, others argue that such content is deliberately deceptive and that public health agencies' failure to proactively address complex topics (like vaccination for those with pre-existing infections) creates openings for these conspiratorial narratives.

Finally, practical aspects were discussed, such as the high cost and limited insurance coverage for men seeking the vaccine, and the role of digital infrastructure (like Denmark's "e-boks") in the program's success. While one user credited the digital system, others countered that similar high vaccination rates are achieved in countries without such centralized digital records, suggesting the key factor is robust public health systems and registers rather than any single piece of technology.

## [Publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 498 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article (linking to the IndieWeb concept of POSSE) advocates for a "Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere" strategy. This approach encourages creators to host their content on a personal website they control, then automatically share or cross-post it to third-party platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, or Substack. The core philosophy is to maintain ownership of one's content and identity while using the reach of centralized social networks, rather than publishing directly on those platforms (the PESOS model).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a necessary reclaiming of ownership from "walled gardens." Several users shared their personal workflows, with one noting they manually post to their site and then syndicate to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter, while others expressed a desire to automate the process using tools like Atom feeds.

While the concept was praised, there was a debate on the practicalities and history of the idea. One commenter lamented that the web failed to standardize on semantic technologies (like microformats and RSS) that would have made this easier years ago. Another thread debated the motivation behind such a move: one user argued it was a reaction to the dominance of LLMs and a desire to return to a pre-internet lifestyle, but others countered that the primary driver is simply data ownership and avoiding corporate control, regardless of AI.

There were also practical warnings raised, such as the risk of social media algorithms down-ranking external links, and a caution regarding the non-commercial license of a specific syndication tool mentioned in the comments (Posse Party).

## [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
**Score:** 458 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46463644

> **Article:** The article "10 years of personal finances in plain text files" describes the author's long-term use of a plain text accounting (PTA) system, specifically the Beancount tool. The author advocates for this method over traditional budgeting apps, highlighting its benefits: data ownership and portability (files are just text), powerful search and analysis capabilities (using standard command-line tools like grep or custom scripts), and extreme flexibility to track not just money but any quantifiable asset (e.g., stocks, RSUs, vacation hours). The post details the author's workflow, including a directory structure with one file per year, and discusses the initial setup effort versus the long-term low-maintenance benefits.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive, with many users sharing their own experiences with Plain Text Accounting tools like Beancount, Ledger, and hledger. A central theme is the trade-off between the high initial learning curve and the long-term power and control this system provides.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **The Power of Plain Text:** Users echo the article's main benefits, emphasizing data ownership, the ability to track complex assets beyond simple bank transactions (like investments, pensions, and RSUs), and the ease of using version control (like git) for history and backup.
*   **Learning Curve and Accessibility:** Several commenters acknowledge that the barrier to entry is high, requiring an understanding of double-entry bookkeeping and a willingness to work with a command-line or text-editor-based interface. One user noted that the true value comes from the process itself, which forces a deeper understanding of one's own finances.
*   **Workflow and Tooling:** Users shared practical tips, such as splitting large files by year to maintain performance, using the Fava web interface as a GUI frontend, and leveraging modern tools like LLMs to help build custom scripts and tooling.
*   **Time Commitment:** A minor debate arose about the 30-45 minutes per month the author spends on their finances. Most commenters felt this was a reasonable and worthwhile investment for the level of insight and control gained.
*   **Criticism:** A dissenting voice argued that this approach is a niche solution for developers and that the vast majority of people would not find it ideal, a point that was acknowledged but largely countered by others who felt the benefits outweighed the complexity for them.

## [2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2026/year-linux-desktop/)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 270 | **ID:** 46471199

> **Article:** The author, Xe Iaso, declares that 2026 will be their "year of the Linux desktop," marking a planned switch from Windows. The post is a critique of modern Windows, citing frustrations with bloatware (like Copilot and Recall), UI inconsistencies (using webviews and React Native for system components), forced hardware upgrades for Windows 11, and a general decline in user experience. The author contrasts this with the appeal of Linux, which offers control, performance on older hardware, and a more "honest" computing experience. The post serves as a personal manifesto and a call to action for others feeling disenfranchised by Microsoft's direction.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates the author's sentiment, reflecting a broader dissatisfaction with Windows and a growing momentum toward Linux. A central theme is the degradation of the Windows user experience, with commenters lamenting the inconsistent and laggy UI, the prevalence of webviews in system applications, and intrusive advertising. Many agree that Microsoft's focus has shifted away from the consumer desktop to enterprise and cloud services, leading to neglect of the core OS.

Conversely, the feasibility and appeal of switching to Linux are explored. Commenters share positive experiences, noting that Linux revitalizes older hardware and offers a more stable, responsive, and controllable environment, especially for development and gaming (thanks to Valve's Proton). However, common barriers remain, such as battery life management on laptops, the lack of professional software like Adobe Photoshop, and kernel-level anti-cheat in games.

The discussion also touches on the "year of the Linux desktop" trope, with many long-time users sharing their own successful transitions years ago, suggesting the trend is cyclical but currently gaining significant traction. The debate over native vs. web-based UI frameworks also emerged, with some defending native UIs while others argue that web technologies offer better design flexibility. Ultimately, the consensus is that Microsoft's recent missteps are pushing a significant number of users, including non-technical ones, to seriously consider Linux for the first time.

## [39th Chaos Communication Congress Videos](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2025)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46464426

> **Article:** The article links to the official media repository for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39c3), a major annual hacker conference held in Hamburg, Germany. The page serves as a central hub for accessing video recordings of all the talks from the event. The talks cover a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, hardware hacking, digital rights, privacy, and societal implications of technology. The link provides access to the full library of presentations from the conference.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around sharing and recommending specific talks, with Cory Doctorow's speech on "a post-American enshittification-resistant internet" being the most prominent. Doctorow's talk, which argues that US trade policy has forced other nations to adopt laws that benefit American Big Tech at the expense of their own citizens and industries, sparked significant interest. A detailed excerpt from his speech was shared, highlighting the coercive nature of trade negotiations (using a CAFTA anecdote) and suggesting that current US tariffs might offer other countries an opportunity to break free from this dynamic.

Beyond Doctorow's talk, the community shared a variety of other recommended sessions. Popular mentions included technical deep dives on hacking Bluetooth headphones, analyzing FreeBSD jails, and a practical guide to in-house electronics manufacturing, which was praised for embodying the "hacker spirit." Other notable talks discussed were on GPG vulnerabilities, washing machine security, and fraud in Germany's public transit system.

The discussion also touched on a notable controversy: the cancellation of a planned talk by AI researcher Joscha Bach. This was reportedly due to the public release of private emails he had with Jeffrey Epstein, which some found offensive. Commenters debated the merits of the cancellation, with some defending Bach's right to private conversation and others supporting the conference's decision, while a separate, unrecorded discussion event was held to address the situation.

Finally, some users debated the overall quality and political slant of the conference. While one user lamented a decline in technical topics and a perceived "left-wing extremism," others pushed back, arguing that antifascism is a core value of the hacker community and that many highly technical talks were indeed present. A lighter, technical note also emerged regarding the video player's "waving cat" icon, which was explained as a "Maneki-neko" used by the video team to detect frozen streams.

## [Parental controls aren't for parents](https://beasthacker.com/til/parental-controls-arent-for-parents.html)
**Score:** 364 | **Comments:** 383 | **ID:** 46464652

> **Article:** The article "Parental controls aren't for parents" argues that digital parental control systems are fundamentally broken and designed to serve corporate interests rather than genuinely helping parents. The author details his frustrating experience trying to set up a safe digital environment for his son, highlighting several key failures:

1.  **App Store Ambiguity:** App stores (like Gabb) offer vague warnings about "communication with strangers" but provide no granular control to block specific, risky apps like GroupMe while allowing others.
2.  **Conflicting Ecosystems:** Gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch create a nightmare of conflicting account systems (Nintendo vs. Microsoft for Minecraft). To enable a single, safe feature (playing online with friends), parents are forced to unlock the entire Nintendo eShop, a store filled with unvetted, often inappropriate content, with no option to disable free downloads.
3.  **The "Ideal Customer" Trap:** The author contends this friction is intentional. Companies design the path of least resistance to be one of total surrender: parents, exhausted by complex settings and conflicting systems, eventually give in, disable controls they don't understand, and allow their children full access to the platform's ecosystem, turning them into the "ideal customer" who pays for subscriptions and makes in-app purchases.

The core thesis is that parental controls are a deceptive facade, not a tool for safety, but a mechanism to offload responsibility onto parents while ensuring corporate platforms remain maximally engaging and profitable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing their own frustrations with the current state of parental controls. The conversation revolves around several key themes:

A central point of agreement is the sheer complexity and unreliability of the technology. Users cite specific pain points, such as Disney+ lacking the ability to hide individual shows (only age ratings), the "enshittification" of bundled services like Hulu injecting unwanted content, and the particularly convoluted experience of setting up Minecraft on the Nintendo Switch, which requires navigating two separate corporate ecosystems (Nintendo and Microsoft). The consensus is that these systems are poorly designed and often fail to provide the promised control.

This leads to a broader debate on parenting strategies. One user advocates for a "co-pilot" model, where children only use devices with a parent present, completely bypassing the need for complex controls. However, this approach is immediately challenged as an unrealistic "luxury" in a world where schools issue iPads and social life is organized through phones. Another proposed solution is a hardline "no phone until 16" rule, which also faces pushback for being socially isolating for the child.

The discussion then branches into two opposing philosophies. One perspective, articulated by user `epiccoleman`, is that most "normal" parents are simply unaware of the dangers of the modern internet and don't see the problem. The other, more cynical view from `miroljub`, is that this constant surveillance is actively harmful, creating a generation that doesn't value privacy because they never experienced it, making them more susceptible to corporate and government overreach later in life.

Ultimately, the thread concludes that the only truly effective approach is active parental involvement and education. Several commenters emphasize that technology is not a substitute for parenting; the solution is to monitor activity, have ongoing conversations with children about online dangers, and teach them to be responsible digital citizens. The overarching sentiment is one of resignation: parents are forced to be constant, vigilant system administrators because the platforms themselves are not designed to be safe.

## [Daft Punk Easter Egg in the BPM Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?](https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/)
**Score:** 360 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46469577

> **Article:** An article on Made By Windmill posits that Daft Punk intentionally encoded a specific BPM (beats per minute) into their song "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger." The author analyzed the track's duration and number of beats to conclude its tempo is precisely 123.45 BPM. The article suggests this is an "Easter egg" – a hidden, clever detail – rather than a coincidence, fitting Daft Punk's reputation for meticulous production and thematic use of numbers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly engaged, with users analyzing the claim from multiple angles. The top comment provides a powerful thematic interpretation, arguing that the 123.45 BPM tempo perfectly mirrors the song's music video, in which the band is abducted and "robotized" by a manager who would likely just type a simple, sequential number like 12345 into a BPM field.

Several users engage in technical analysis and debate:
*   **Verification and Correction:** One user points out a calculation error in the original article, providing a corrected formula. This sparks a "red string" theory-crafting session where another user attempts to extend the math to find a more perfect "123.4567 BPM" and a corresponding 456 beats in the song.
*   **Real-World Testing:** A user reports testing the track in music software (Reaper) and finding the tempo to be closer to 123.47 BPM, introducing a note of skepticism about the precision of the claim.
*   **Broader Context:** The conversation expands to include other famous musical "Easter eggs" (Aphex Twin, Venetian Snares), the original sample source for the song (Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby"), and the nature of tempo stability in electronic music production.

A minor side-thread emerged about a user flagging a comment as AI-generated, which was quickly challenged by others as an overreaction, highlighting a recurring community concern about AI policing.

## [Standard Ebooks: Public Domain Day 2026 in Literature](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026)
**Score:** 355 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46462702

> **Article:** This article from Standard Ebooks announces the works entering the US public domain on January 1, 2026. This "Public Domain Day" will see books originally published in 1930 become freely available, including notable titles like *The Maltese Falcon* by Dashiell Hammett, *The Sound and the Fury* by William Faulkner, and *The Weans* by Robert Nathan. The post also highlights the specific contributions of its volunteer community, who have produced high-quality, modern ebook editions of these and other works for the project's 2026 launch.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the Standard Ebooks project for its high-quality editions and significant cultural contribution. Key themes emerging from the comments include:

*   **Appreciation and Quality:** Multiple users express gratitude for the project, noting the superior formatting and design compared to other sources like Project Gutenberg. The quality of the book covers was specifically complimented.
*   **Copyright Complexity:** A significant thread discusses the complexities of international copyright law. Users point out that the article's focus on US law is a major caveat, as works entering the public domain in the US may still be under copyright elsewhere (e.g., Canada, France), and vice-versa. The non-retroactive nature of some copyright law changes was also highlighted.
*   **Cultural Inflection Point:** One commenter theorized that as more high-quality cultural artifacts enter the public domain, they will provide a valuable filter against the rising tide of "AI slop," potentially leading to new platforms for consuming and preserving this content.
*   **Related Projects and Efforts:** The conversation spurred mentions of related tools, including a personal library management app that integrates Standard Ebooks, and a personal blog post comparing the quality of various ebook projects. A user also shared their own experience manually creating an ebook from a paperback, illustrating the often-unseen labor involved in digitization.

## [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
**Score:** 316 | **Comments:** 638 | **ID:** 46465327

> **Article:** The article, published on the 30th anniversary of the first IPv6 specification, reflects on the protocol's slow and incomplete adoption. It frames the situation not as a total failure, but as a complex transition that has taken a very different path than originally envisioned. The core argument is that IPv6 has succeeded in the areas where it was most needed—absorbing the explosive growth of mobile networks, broadband, and cloud services—thereby preventing a total exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. However, it has failed to "take over the world" and replace IPv4, which remains dominant in many enterprise and residential environments. The article highlights that the internet now exists in a prolonged "dual-stack" era, where both protocols run in parallel, and that the original goal of eventually turning off IPv4 seems increasingly distant.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide between IPv6's large-scale success and its persistent friction for individual users and smaller operators. A central theme is the clash between macro-level adoption statistics and frustrating personal experiences. While some engineers report that over 75% of traffic on their large networks is already IPv6, many others find it unusable or impractical for home servers, self-hosting, and small businesses.

Key points of contention and experience include:
*   **ISP Inconsistency:** A major pain point is the lack of reliable support from Internet Service Providers. Many residential users report that their ISP either doesn't offer IPv6 at all, or provides it in a "janky" way (like tunneling over IPv4) and refuses to give out static prefixes, forcing users to rely on dynamic DNS scripts.
*   **Application and Service Gaps:** Several users point out that IPv6 is still not a default for many services. This is especially problematic in gaming (where some game servers don't support it) and for mobile connectivity (where some 4G/5G networks still have issues), creating a situation where an IPv6-only service is inaccessible to a significant portion of users.
*   **The Privacy Debate:** A significant argument revolves around privacy. One commenter passionately argued that IPv6's device-level addressing is a gift to surveillance, preferring the "casual anonymity" of IPv4's network-level addressing. This was countered by others who pointed out that ISPs can be subpoenaed for either type of address, and that modern tracking relies far more on browser fingerprinting than on IP addresses.
*   **The "Why Bother?" Factor:** For many, the complexity and dual-stack maintenance overhead of IPv6 outweigh its benefits. The consensus is that IPv6 is seen as an optional, additional layer of configuration rather than a simple replacement, leading many to stick with the familiar, if limited, IPv4.

## [Clicks Communicator](https://www.clicksphone.com/en/communicator)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 201 | **ID:** 46467057

> **Article:** The article links to the product page for "Clicks Communicator," a physical keyboard case designed for modern smartphones (initially for iPhone 15/16, with Android versions available). It aims to bring back the tactile typing experience of classic devices like the BlackBerry. The product features a QWERTY keyboard that connects via USB-C or Lightning, includes shortcut keys for navigation and system functions, and claims to improve typing speed and accuracy while freeing up the screen real estate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is largely positive, driven by nostalgia for physical keyboards (specifically BlackBerry and Palm Treo) and frustration with modern touchscreen typing. Many users express that they never regained the typing efficiency they had with physical keyboards after switching to iPhones.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Productivity vs. Distraction:** A major debate centers on whether this device is a productivity tool or just another gadget. One user argues that the marketing should focus on the keyboard's superiority for "main device" productivity (writing emails, coding, editing spreadsheets) rather than framing it as a "second device" for digital minimalism. Others counter that social media addiction makes a single-device solution unrealistic for most.
*   **Technical Utility & Customization:** Tech-savvy users are interested in the hardware but want to know if it can be decoupled from the stock operating system. There are specific requests for Linux support, unlocked bootloaders, and GrapheneOS compatibility.
*   **Use Cases:** While some see it as a tool for general texting, others view it as a portable workstation for coding via SSH (using tools like Neovim or Claude Code), though some skepticism exists regarding the lack of dedicated keys like Ctrl or arrows.
*   **Criticism:** A minority view the product as lacking true innovation or question the logic of buying a dedicated hardware accessory rather than using software solutions (like custom launchers or dictation).

## [Assorted less(1) tips](https://blog.thechases.com/posts/assorted-less-tips/)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46464120

> **Article:** The article "Assorted less(1) tips" is a guide to getting more out of the `less` command-line pager. It covers several useful command-line flags and interactive commands. Key tips include using `-R` for raw control characters (color), `-X` to prevent clearing the screen on exit, and `-E` to quit automatically if the entire file fits on one screen. The article also highlights interactive features like using `&` to filter lines with regexes, `s` to save the current file or pipe output to a new file, and `+F` to "follow" a file or stream (similar to `tail -f`). It also mentions the `lesskey` utility for customizing key bindings.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expanded on the original article by adding more tips and exploring alternatives. A major theme was the `+F` / `F` command for following file output, which many users found more powerful than `tail -f` because it allows you to exit follow mode to search or navigate, then re-enter it. Several other flags were suggested, most notably `-R` (for color), `-X` (no screen clearing), and `-L` (to bypass pre-processing of files like logs).

Users also shared practical tricks, such as using `s` to save piped output to a file (avoiding the need for `tee`) and using `Ctrl-R` at the start of a search to treat it as a literal string. The discussion also touched on customization via `lesskey` (noting its absence on macOS's default `less`) and mentioned several modern alternatives to `less`, including `glow` (for Markdown), `ov`, and `moor`.

## [Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams](https://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2025/12/fighting-fire-with-fire-scalable-oral.html)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 200 | **ID:** 46467677

> **Article:** The article "Fighting Fire with Fire: Scalable Oral Exams" proposes a system to combat AI cheating in higher education. The author argues that traditional take-home assignments are now obsolete because students can easily use Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete them. This creates a problem where honest students are disadvantaged and instructors cannot accurately assess individual learning.

The proposed solution is to use AI agents to conduct oral exams at scale. The system works by having an AI interviewer ask students personalized, follow-up questions based on their submitted work (such as code or essays). The interaction is recorded via webcam to deter impersonation. The author highlights that this method is cheap (approx. $0.42 per student), allows for unlimited practice runs, and forces students to demonstrate genuine understanding of their own submissions rather than just submitting AI-generated content. The goal is to restore integrity to the assessment process by verifying that the student actually did the work and understands the concepts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply skeptical of the proposed AI-orals solution, viewing it as a dystopian response to a systemic problem. The debate centers on the dehumanization of education, the inevitable escalation of the cheating "arms race," and the fundamental purpose of assessment.

A dominant theme is the **loss of human connection and respect**. Many commenters expressed that being interrogated by an AI feels "dehumanizing" and disrespectful, especially for high-stakes exams. They argue that oral exams should be a dialogue between humans, and that removing the human element degrades the educational experience. Some shared personal anecdotes about how intimidating human examiners could be, but still preferred that to a machine, while others noted that AI might actually be less stressful for those with social anxiety, provided the AI is not programmed to be hostile.

There is also a strong sense of **technological pessimism and an arms race**. Commenters immediately pointed out that if AI is used to grade, students will simply use more advanced AI to cheat the system (e.g., using text-to-speech and hidden microphones). This led to a broader philosophical question: if the goal is to use AI to verify learning, why not just use AI to teach the course in the first place? Several users argued that the focus should be on changing the educational model entirely, perhaps moving away from traditional assessment, rather than trying to patch a broken system with more technology.

Finally, the discussion touched on the **blurring lines between education and employment**. Several users noted that AI-led interviews are already common in the tech industry, and the same problems (dishonesty, dehumanization, and assessing the wrong skills) are appearing there. This context suggests the problem isn't unique to universities but is a broader societal shift. While some defended the utility of the tool as a way to verify project-based work, the overwhelming sentiment was that this is a "cringe" and temporary fix that avoids addressing the root causes of why students feel the need to cheat.

> **Article:** The article announces that the "jank" programming language has reached its alpha release. jank is a native, compiled implementation of Clojure, designed to be a high-performance, drop-in replacement for Clojure on the JVM. The project provides a comprehensive book for documentation and learning, which was the primary focus of the Hacker News discussion. The author, Jeaye, notes that the official alpha announcement wasn't quite ready, but the excitement from the community has brought it to public attention.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing excitement for a native Clojure implementation. Key themes included:

*   **Documentation and Contribution:** The central point of discussion was the accompanying "jank book." Multiple users pointed out typos and broken links (e.g., "foreward" vs. "foreword"), and one offered to submit pull requests. The author was responsive, quickly fixing reported issues.
*   **Language Features and Roadmap:** Users inquired about the language's type system. It was clarified that jank is dynamically typed like Clojure, but the author has expressed future interest in adding optional gradual typing. There was also a question about whether jank would remain a faithful Clojure implementation or diverge, with the community hoping for a "drop-in replacement."
*   **Developer Tooling:** An Emacs user asked about tooling support, specifically for CIDER. The author confirmed that a working nREPL server exists but is not yet merged due to a Clang bug, identifying it as a high-priority item.
*   **Community and Humor:** The tone was supportive, with users offering "big kudos." There was also some light-hearted humor, with several commenters misreading "Jank Lang" as a person's name (e.g., French politician Jack Lang) or a financial term ("investment alpha").

## [Unix v4 (1973) – Live Terminal](https://unixv4.dev/)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46468283

> **Article:** The article links to an external website, `unixv4.dev`, which provides a live, browser-accessible terminal session emulating a PDP-11 running the original Unix v4 operating system from 1973. The site offers an authentic command-line interface for users to interact with this historic system, serving as an interactive educational and nostalgic demonstration of early computing history.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes, with the most immediate being the site's immediate unavailability due to the "HN effect," as users reported rate limiting and server overload. A significant portion of the conversation revolved around trust and legality. Users expressed concerns about the service logging IP addresses and questioned the lack of an open-source license, making it difficult to verify what data was being collected. This led to a debate on the "threat model" of an emulated vintage system, with some arguing it was harmless fun while others remained wary of non-OSS services.

Legality was also a point of contention, with one user questioning if the project had a license from the current copyright holder (Novell). However, another user clarified that Caldera (who acquired the rights) had released Research Unix versions up to v7 under a permissive BSD-style license, likely making the project legal.

Finally, there was technical and historical engagement. Users shared a link to a blog post about a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Unix v4 code, sparking a discussion on the history of exploit techniques. There was also a technical suggestion to run the emulator entirely in-browser using JavaScript to avoid backend load issues, and a discussion on which period-correct terminal emulation (VT-52 vs. VT420) would be most authentic for that era.

## [A small collection of text-only websites](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46463635

> **Article:** The article "A small collection of text-only websites" presents a curated list of websites that prioritize content over style by offering minimalist, text-focused versions. The author highlights sites like Daring Fireball (via its `.text` extension), NPR, and various "lite" versions of news outlets. The piece serves as a celebration of the "old web" aesthetic, emphasizing the benefits of fast loading times, readability, and accessibility. It implicitly advocates for a simpler approach to web design where content is the primary focus, free from the bloat of modern web development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to the article, with the discussion quickly expanding into a broader conversation about the value and history of minimalist web design. Key themes included:

*   **Nostalgia and Historical Context:** Several commenters recalled the era when "printer-friendly" versions of websites were common and noted that major news sites, like CNN, reverted to text-only modes during high-traffic events like the September 11th attacks to ensure stability.
*   **Practical Implementation:** Users shared their own methods for creating text-first content, such as serving data via `.json` or `.txt` extensions, and discussed the design principles behind famously simple sites like berkshirehathaway.com.
*   **Modern Alternatives:** The conversation extended beyond the HTTP protocol to include other text-centric protocols like Gemini and Gopher, which are designed for a minimalist internet experience.
*   **Aesthetic Debate:** A minor debate emerged about what constitutes a "true" text-only site, with one user pointing out that some "minimalist" sites are still just lightly styled HTML/CSS rather than pure text.
*   **Personal Anecdotes:** Commenters shared personal habits, like "printing to PDF" to archive articles, and expressed appreciation for the author of the article for compiling the list.

## [FreeBSD: Home NAS, part 1 – configuring ZFS mirror (RAID1)](https://rtfm.co.ua/en/freebsd-home-nas-part-1-configuring-zfs-mirror-raid1/)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46462108

> **Article:** The article is a technical guide for setting up a home NAS using FreeBSD. It focuses specifically on configuring a ZFS mirror (equivalent to RAID1) for data redundancy. The guide walks through the initial steps, including installing FreeBSD, partitioning the disks, and using the command line to create and manage the ZFS pool. It aims to provide a solid foundation for a reliable storage server using FreeBSD's native tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is broadly positive, with users expressing a desire for more content on FreeBSD, particularly regarding ZFS and the bhyve hypervisor. A key theme is the appeal of a modern server stack without systemd.

Several technical points are debated and elaborated on:
*   **ECC RAM and ZFS:** One user laments that the guide's hardware lacks ECC RAM, a common recommendation for ZFS to prevent data corruption. However, another user counters that this is a risk for all filesystems, not just ZFS.
*   **ZFS Benefits for Home Use:** A user questions if ZFS is worth the complexity for infrequent home use. The community responds with strong arguments for its value, highlighting its superior data integrity features (checksums that report disk or cable errors), intuitive command-line interface, and powerful, cheap snapshots for versioning and backups. It's also noted that software RAID like ZFS is often more resilient than hardware RAID.
*   **Boot Environments:** A significant contribution is the mention of "boot environments" (`bectl`), a feature that allows for atomic system updates and easy rollbacks by creating a snapshot of the boot environment. This is compared to A/B updates in Android and "system generations" in NixOS.
*   **Broader Context:** The conversation touches on related topics like ZFS on Linux, NVMe vs. HDD setups for performance, and a philosophical point that users shouldn't have to spend so much time on the "baselines" of storage and should focus more on application management and integration.

## [Punkt. Unveils MC03 Smartphone](https://www.punkt.ch/blogs/news/punkt-unveils-mc03)
**Score:** 132 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46466364

> **Article:** Punkt. has unveiled the MC03, a €700 smartphone that operates on a subscription model. The device runs "AphyOS," a privacy-focused, "de-Googled" version of Android. The mandatory subscription (approx. €10/month) is required to maintain access to core services, security features, and OS updates. The company markets this as a way for users to pay to retain their data privacy, rather than having their data be the product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction to the MC03 is overwhelmingly negative, with most commenters viewing the subscription model as a fundamental flaw. The primary criticisms are:

*   **The "Phone-as-a-Service" Model:** The most common objection is to the concept of paying a recurring fee to keep a physical device fully functional. Users feel this is an anti-consumer practice that treats them as a revenue stream rather than owners of their hardware. The idea of "renting" a device you've purchased is seen as a step backward.
*   **Lack of True Freedom:** Despite being marketed as a privacy device, many argue it's just another "walled garden." The reliance on a proprietary OS and subscription for core features prevents users from having true control, such as installing their own firmware. This is contrasted with projects like GrapheneOS, which offer true device ownership.
*   **Target Audience Mismatch:** Commenters are confused about who the phone is for. Tech-savvy users who value privacy are capable of setting up their own solutions (like GrapheneOS on a Pixel) and wouldn't accept a locked-in subscription. The average consumer is unlikely to pay a premium for a device with limited app support and a mandatory monthly fee.
*   **Skepticism of the Business Model:** Some users drew parallels to other privacy-focused services like Proton, suggesting the company is "virtue signaling" to capitalize on privacy concerns rather than offering a genuinely empowering product. There was also criticism that the OS is a fork of an old version of GrapheneOS, which the company has not publicly addressed.
*   **A Counterpoint on Funding:** One commenter offered a nuanced defense, suggesting that paying directly for an OS is a more transparent and sustainable model than the hidden costs in mainstream devices or the unreliable nature of FOSS donations. However, this view was a minority and did not overcome the strong negative sentiment toward the specific implementation.
