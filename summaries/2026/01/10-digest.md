In a landmark moment for AI-assisted mathematics, Terence Tao announced that Erdős problem #728 has been "more or less autonomously" solved, leveraging tools like Aristotle (a Lean proof assistant) and ChatGPT. While the headline suggests full autonomy, the reality was a collaborative dance between a world-class mathematician and AI, highlighting how these tools are becoming indispensable for grinding through formal verification and tedious pattern-matching. This breakthrough isn't just about solving one problem—it signals a future where AI accelerates theoretical research by rapidly testing hypotheses and constants, potentially chipping away at Millennium Prize Problems. Yet, skeptics note the solution still required human rigor to verify, underscoring that AI is a powerful co-pilot, not an autopilot, in the quest for knowledge.  

This AI wave is stress-testing business models across tech. Adam Wathan of Tailwind Labs candidly explained how tools like v0 and Cursor commoditized his UI component kits, forcing a pivot toward operational excellence, brand trust, and deep domain expertise—areas where human judgment still reigns. Meanwhile, the open-source ethos faces an existential crisis: Marc J. Schmidt declared he’ll close-source new code, arguing LLMs trained on public repos have eroded the monetization of libraries. While many countered that open-source thrives on altruism and career capital, not direct sales, the tension is palpable. The future may favor API-based metering over raw code, but the community’s resilience—evidenced by projects like Open Chaos, which lets voters steer its evolution weekly—shows open collaboration isn’t dead yet.  

On the desktop front, Linux is having a renaissance. A Verge editor’s seamless switch to Bazzite for gaming—thanks to Proton—echoes a broader sentiment: modern Linux is stable, bloat-free, and a "breath of fresh air" compared to Windows’ ad-infested, AI-pushing agenda. Yet Windows 11’s decline into "the slowest in 25 years" (plagued by bloatware and technical debt) isn’t just driving users to Linux; it’s exposing a deeper rot. Even Microsoft’s own migration pressure can’t mask the frustration of users on "unsupported" hardware struggling with sluggish performance. Meanwhile, developer tools aren’t immune to bloat. Oh My Zsh’s 380ms startup time sparked a classic debate: pragmatists defend its convenience for quick setups, while minimalists preach custom configs for sub-100ms speeds. Tools like Fish or Zim offer middle grounds, but the real takeaway is that performance is a trade-off—convenience today versus control tomorrow.  

Data visualization and security had their own reckonings. Dark Sky’s eulogy mourned Apple’s failure to replicate its "glanceable" hyperlocal forecasts, leaving users scavenging for alternatives like WeatherGraph or Breezy Weather. In contrast, the Snowden PDF leak was a masterclass in oversight: journalists’ incremental PDF edits left redacted text recoverable via tools like `pdfresurrect`, a stark reminder that digital sanitization is fraught. Print-and-scan was suggested, but modern printers embed invisible dots—there’s no easy win in opsec.  

Beyond the big themes, practical hacks and experiments emerged. The "5 minutes past" meeting trick aims to build buffers into calendars, but cynics note it’s a band-aid for a culture that disrespects time—real change requires leadership, not just scheduling tweaks. On the hardware front, OLED monitors face a text-rendering crisis: QD-OLED’s triangular subpixels cause fringing and eye strain, making them a hard sell for productivity despite their media prowess. And in infrastructure innovation, VoltAir’s drone-charging-on-power-lines is clever (using induction to perch and recharge), though wildfire risks and the "vampire drone" optics linger.  

Finally, geopolitical tech tensions simmered. The UK’s self-exemption from its cyber law bill reeked of "rules for thee," while Iran’s precision internet shutdowns—designed to mask state violence—highlighted how authoritarian regimes weaponize connectivity. As Starlink and mesh networks offer lifelines, the battle for digital sovereignty intensifies.  

*Worth watching*: The EU’s upcoming RGB-stripe OLED panels could finally solve the text-fringing dilemma, making OLED viable for coders. Also, track how AI’s role in math evolves—if it tackles even one Millennium Problem, the floodgates will open.
