# HN Daily Digest - 2026-01-10

The most alarming development today is Vietnam's decision to ban rooted phones from banking apps, a move framed as security but dripping with surveillance-state overtones. The policy, which also blocks unlocked bootloaders and ADB access, effectively criminalizes custom ROMs and advanced device control. While some argue it reduces bank liability for hacked accounts, the Hacker News thread quickly exposed the hypocrisy: banks still allow web access from admin-privileged machines, and the real motive appears tied to Vietnam's VNeID digital identity project. Commenters warned this isn't just about e-waste—it's a blueprint for authoritarian control, with personal risks for anyone attempting technical workarounds.  

This theme of institutional overreach echoes in other stories. Cloudflare's CEO called Italy's fines an attack by a "shadowy cabal," but HN saw hypocrisy in his appeal to political figures known for censorship. Meanwhile, Flock Safety's hardcoded API key—found 53 times in public repos—exposed America's license plate surveillance infrastructure, with the company stonewalling fixes for months. Both cases highlight how corporations and governments prioritize control over security or transparency.  

The European Commission's "call for evidence" on open source sparked similar skepticism. HN regulars braced for bureaucratic hydra monsters, noting Europe already birthed Linux and Debian. The real fear? That the EU will fund consulting firms to reinvent wheels instead of backing existing projects like Codeberg, all while chasing "digital sovereignty" from U.S. tech giants.  

In AI, Terence Tao celebrated an autonomous solve of Erdős problem #728 via the LEAN proof assistant, but the victory was nuanced. The "Aristotle" system isn't an LLM—it's a specialized tool that still needed human corrections. This mirrors the WebAssembly debate: WASM’s promise is real (Figma, AutoCAD), but its DOM-handling limitations and JavaScript dependency mean it’s not replacing JS anytime soon. WasmGC might change that, but ecosystem infighting over WASI standards suggests a long road ahead.  

Developer tools saw both innovation and absurdity. Kagi's Orion browser landed on Linux (WebKit-only, paid alpha), drawing ire for its closed-source nature. The "Scroll Wikipedia like TikTok" project used generative UI for vertical video, but users slammed its word-by-word text rendering as unreadable without audio. Meanwhile, Dwitter's 140-character JS demos sparked debates on whether `eval(unescape(...))` tricks are clever or cheating.  

Nostalgia surfaced with the London–Calcutta bus service (1957–1976), a 50-day hippie trail killed by Afghan wars. HN debated if modern travel is worse—sure, we have vaccines and civil rights, but can you still drive a Fiat 500 to Kabul? Elsewhere, Markdown's "worse is better" victory over DocBook was celebrated, though users still grumble about intra-word emphasis ambiguities.  

Finally, the "No Fakes Act" threatens open-source AI with liability traps. The bill’s fingerprinting requirement would force model creators to police misuse, risking statutory damages while shielding Big Tech. HN likened it to making hammer manufacturers liable for burglaries—a regulatory moat that could kill hobbyist AI.  

**Worth watching**: How the EU’s open-source initiative navigates community backlash. If it funds existing projects instead of creating bureaucratic forks, it might actually help. Otherwise, expect another "hydra monster."
