The Vietnamese government's decision to ban rooted phones from banking apps has ignited a fierce debate about security theater versus genuine control. While officials frame this as a necessary measure against fraud, the Hacker News community quickly dissected the realpolitik: it's a deliberate step toward integrating mobile devices into Vietnam's broader digital surveillance apparatus, specifically the VNeID project linking identity to hardware. The practical absurdity shines through—users are forced into carrying two devices or abandoning rooted phones that extend hardware lifespans, all while banks' web portals remain accessible from rooted desktops. Technically, the ban is a flimsy barrier; root-hiding tools currently bypass it, though Google's Play Integrity may eventually force a game of whack-a-mole with hardware vulnerabilities. This mirrors a global trend where smartphones morph from personal computers into locked-down terminals, sacrificing user autonomy for the illusion of security.

Meanwhile, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince's plea to U.S. political figures over Italian fines reveals the cynical calculus of tech power. His framing of AGCOM's anti-piracy enforcement as a "free speech" threat rings hollow to a community that sees Cloudflare as the ultimate gatekeeper. The irony of Prince aligning with Elon Musk—who bans critics while touting free speech—and JD Vance, a figure many view as antagonistic to expression, wasn't lost on commenters. This isn't principle; it's a corporation playing the political game to protect its monopoly, dressed in the tattered robes of internet idealism. The discussion highlighted how European regulators, while sometimes petty, are pushing back against a status quo where a single U.S. company dictates global access.

The European Commission's call for evidence on open source policy sparked a philosophical brawl. One faction equated open source with communism, only to be countered by libertarians claiming it as decentralization incarnate. Skeptics warned of bureaucratic EU-approved forks and politicians preferring the clear contracts of proprietary software, while optimists pointed to Europe's existing open source legacy—Debian, VLC, LibreOffice—as proof of potential. The real tension lies in the EU's goal: reducing dependency on U.S. tech giants. Open source isn't the endgame but a tool for digital sovereignty, though whether Brussels can avoid stifling it with red tape remains dubious.

In AI milestones, Terence Tao's announcement that Erdős problem #728 was solved "autonomously" by a specialized tool (Aristotle, working with Lean) marks a quiet revolution. This isn't a general LLM brute-forcing answers; it's AI reasoning within formal mathematical structures, hinting at a future where mathematicians offload tedious proof refinement to machines. The community noted this could accelerate research, though debates linger on whether it's true creativity or sophisticated pattern-matching. Contrast this with WebAssembly's reality check: once touted as a JavaScript killer, it's now a specialized tool for heavy computations (like Figma or games), hamstrung by DOM interaction hurdles, binary bloat, and a JavaScript ecosystem so robust that WASM's niche appeal struggles to justify its complexity.

On the infrastructure front, Flock Safety's hardcoded API key—exposing nationwide surveillance data—was a masterclass in negligence. The company's "never been hacked" spin collapsed under the weight of 55 days of unpatched vulnerability, with commenters sarcastically noting that handing over the key isn't hacking; it's incompetence. This ties into a broader pattern of security theater, echoed in the SendGrid phishing campaign exploiting political rage to bypass email filters. Both stories reveal how brittle systems and human psychology are weaponized, whether by lazy vendors or cynical scammers.

The creative coding scene offered lighter fare: a piano-by-ear memory game, a TikTok-ified Wikipedia generator (criticized as "enshittifying knowledge"), and a rocket orbit simulator that lets you Kerbal your way to orbit without atmospheric drag. Dwitter's 140-character JavaScript demos sparked debates on "cheating" via eval tricks and Unicode byte gymnastics, celebrating the art of constraints. Meanwhile, Markdown's history was revisited as a "worse is better" triumph over DocBook and Word, though its semantic ambiguities (like underscores vs. italics) remain a thorn in purists' sides.

Historical nostalgia crept in with the London–Calcutta bus service—a 50-day, £85 journey (roughly £2K today) that thrived before oil crises and border conflicts ended it. Comparisons to modern travel ignored how such trips were luxuries of time, not budget. In health, a Cochrane review suggesting exercise rivals therapy for depression faced skepticism: the chicken-and-egg motivation problem, debates over therapy/medication efficacy, and statistical nitpicking over "clinically meaningful" effect sizes all underscored how hard it is to translate studies into lived reality.

Finally, the Raspberry Pi + RTX 5090 experiment was a glorious Frankenstein's monster: technically impressive (60 FPS in *Cyberpunk* via ARM translation), but a testament to why we don't do this. It’s a fun hack that highlights the Pi's ecosystem strengths—and its decline as a cost-effective desktop against x86 mini-PCs.

**Worth watching**: The Aristotle/Lean AI math solver. It's a glimpse into a future where formal reasoning becomes collaborative, not just computational.
