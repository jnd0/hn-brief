# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-13

## [Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview)
**Score:** 1023 | **Comments:** 451 | **ID:** 46593022

> **Article:** Anthropic has released "Cowork," a research preview of a desktop application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for its powerful Claude Code agent. The goal is to make the advanced capabilities of Claude Code accessible to non-developers ("the general population"). The app allows users to perform non-coding tasks like organizing files, managing calendars, and creating presentations by interacting with a visual interface instead of a command line. The article positions this as a necessary step to broaden the adoption of agentic AI for everyday work and life management.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive, with a strong consensus that this is a logical and necessary evolution. Many users, including developers, confirm they already use Claude Code for a wide range of non-development tasks like managing personal finances, booking appointments, and classifying data. The key insight is that the underlying AI capability is already there; the main barrier for non-technical users is the command-line interface. Cowork is seen as a "harness" that bridges this gap.

A significant technical point of debate arises around the application's capabilities. One commenter cautions that the demo is misleading, as the AI is likely using standard command-line tools (like `ls`) rather than true visual understanding of the desktop. This sparked a broader conversation about the current state of AI image recognition, with some users sharing surprising successes with Claude's visual analysis, while others agree it's a current weakness that requires explicit prompting.

There is also some skepticism about the societal need for such automation, with one user sarcastically noting that the future of work seems to be automating meetings and slide decks. Another commenter raised a practical limitation: the current web-based version of Cowork runs in a sandboxed environment and cannot access the user's local command-line tools or custom scripts, which limits its utility for power users who have already built automated workflows.

## [Apple picks Gemini to power Siri](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html)
**Score:** 874 | **Comments:** 541 | **ID:** 46589675

> **Article:** According to a CNBC report, Apple has selected Google's Gemini AI model to power a future version of Siri. This represents a major strategic shift for Apple, which has been struggling to advance its own AI capabilities. The deal would see Apple officially acknowledge and integrate a competitor's technology at the core of its flagship voice assistant, following a previous integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT for more complex queries.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by a mix of surprise, strategic analysis, and skepticism. A key point of debate is the strategic wisdom of outsourcing a core user experience to a major competitor. While some see this as a mistake, many others interpret it as a pragmatic and smart business decision.

The most prominent theory is that this is a financial maneuver. Given the enormous capital expenditure required to train frontier models, Apple is avoiding this cost and instead leveraging its multi-billion dollar search deal with Google. One highly-upvoted comment frames this as Apple focusing on its strengths in "last mile" delivery and on-device inference, while letting Google "burn the gigawatts" on training. This is seen as a cost-effective way to provide a state-of-the-art model without the massive investment.

There is also significant discussion about the user experience. Some users express disappointment and a willingness to stop using Siri, while others hope for a model-selection option similar to the current ChatGPT integration. The move is also seen as an admission of Apple's lag in the AI race, with some commenters defending this as a typical "slow and steady" Apple approach, while others see it as a clear failure to innovate. Finally, a few comments touch on the reliability of the chosen partner, with Google seen as a more stable enterprise provider than OpenAI or Anthropic.

## [Floppy disks turn out to be the greatest TV remote for kids](https://blog.smartere.dk/2026/01/floppy-disks-the-best-tv-remote-for-kids/)
**Score:** 654 | **Comments:** 371 | **ID:** 46587934

> **Article:** An article on the "Smartere" blog details a creative tech project for children: repurposing old floppy disks as physical TV remote controls. The system works by using a floppy drive connected to a computer (like a Raspberry Pi) to read a unique identifier from a floppy disk when it's inserted. This identifier triggers a specific media action, such as playing a particular cartoon or music playlist. The author argues this method is ideal for kids because it's tactile, simple, and bypasses the confusing and ad-filled interfaces of modern smart TVs. The project is presented as a fun, low-cost DIY solution that gives children direct, screen-free control over their media consumption.

## [TimeCapsuleLLM: LLM trained only on data from 1800-1875](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM)
**Score:** 628 | **Comments:** 260 | **ID:** 46590280

> **Article:** The project "TimeCapsuleLLM" is a small language model trained exclusively on a historical dataset of texts published between 1800 and 1875. The model is available on GitHub and is based on either a nanoGPT or Phi 1.5 architecture, making it relatively lightweight to run. The core concept is to create an AI "time capsule" that has no knowledge of the modern world, allowing for experiments in historical simulation and testing the model's ability to reason about concepts not present in its training data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's discussion centered on the potential applications and philosophical implications of this model. A primary theme was using the model as a test for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Several users speculated on whether a model trained only on pre-20th-century data could independently deduce or reason about modern scientific concepts like quantum mechanics and relativity. The consensus was that it could not, as these discoveries relied on experimental data that did not exist in the model's training set, though it might be able to develop some of the underlying mathematics.

There was also significant practical interest in how to easily run the model, with users asking for convenient methods like pre-quantized files for Ollama or llama.cpp. On a more critical note, some users were skeptical of the project's utility, suggesting that for historical insight, a history book would be more accurate and far less energy-intensive. Finally, a user provided a humorous example of the model's output, which resembled a nonsensical Markov chain, highlighting the potential limitations of small models trained on limited data.

## [Postal Arbitrage](https://walzr.com/postal-arbitrage)
**Score:** 421 | **Comments:** 212 | **ID:** 46591708

> **Article:** The article "Postal Arbitrage" by Riley Walz explores a creative method of sending messages by leveraging Amazon's grocery delivery service. The core idea is to send a single, inexpensive item (like a lime or a bag of gravy mix) to a friend. The recipient then receives the item along with the packing slip, which the sender can write a custom message on. The author frames this as a form of "arbitrage" because the cost of the item plus the (often free) shipping for Prime members is potentially cheaper than the price of a postage stamp to send a traditional letter or postcard. The article is presented as a humorous, tongue-in-cheek experiment in using modern logistics systems for personal communication.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on "Postal Arbitrage" was multifaceted, with users engaging with the concept from several angles.

A central point of debate was the actual cost and economic viability of the scheme. Many commenters questioned the premise, pointing out that Amazon Fresh often has a minimum order value for free delivery, making it impossible to send a single cheap item. Others argued about the sunk cost of an Amazon Prime subscription, stating that the method is only "free" for those who already pay for Prime, while it would be quite expensive for non-members.

The conversation also touched on the historical context of arbitrage, with users noting the similarity to the original Ponzi scheme, which involved buying International Reply Coupons in one country and redeeming them for more valuable stamps in another. This led to a brief discussion on why Ponzi's original arbitrage failed (low profit margins) and how he pivoted to his infamous fraud.

Many comments focused on the experiential and philosophical aspects. Some celebrated the creativity and humor of the idea, while others argued that receiving a message printed on a receipt slip is a poor substitute for a handwritten card. A significant thread criticized the environmental impact and wastefulness of shipping an item solely for its packaging, with one user sarcastically suggesting that sending a free text message would be a better alternative. Finally, there was a minor tangent about the creator, Riley Walz, and his other projects like Jmail.world.

## [Ozempic is changing the foods Americans buy](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy)
**Score:** 413 | **Comments:** 757 | **ID:** 46587536

> **Article:** A Cornell University study analyzing retail data found that US households using GLP-1 medications (like Ozempic) significantly change their purchasing habits. Within six months of starting the medication, these households reduced their overall grocery spending by an average of 5.3% (8% for higher-income households). The composition of their spending shifted away from processed foods: spending on savory snacks, sweets, and baked goods dropped by roughly 10%. Conversely, purchases of yogurt, fresh fruit, nutrition bars, and meat snacks increased. The study notes that these changes tend to reverse if the medication is discontinued.

## [Date is out, Temporal is in](https://piccalil.li/blog/date-is-out-and-temporal-is-in/)
**Score:** 397 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46589658

> **Article:** The article "Date is out, Temporal is in" argues that JavaScript's built-in `Date` object is fundamentally flawed for handling human-scale time concepts like calendar dates, times, and time zones. The author explains that `Date` conflates these concepts with absolute, machine-level timestamps, leading to confusing behavior and difficult parsing. The article introduces the new Temporal API as the modern solution. Temporal provides dedicated objects for different time concepts (e.g., `Temporal.PlainDate`, `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`, `Temporal.Instant`), is immutable (methods return new objects), and offers a comprehensive, predictable API that correctly handles time zones, calendars, and edge cases like Daylight Saving Time.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive about the *idea* of Temporal but highly critical of the article's title and its claim that Temporal is "in." The primary point of contention is the current state of browser adoption. Multiple commenters point out that native support is extremely limited, with only the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome having it, and Safari and Edge lacking support entirely. They reference CanIUse data to show its global availability is negligible (around 1.8%), making it impractical for production use without a polyfill.

The conversation then shifts to the practicalities of using Temporal today. While the polyfill is available and praised, its significant size (~51KB) is noted as a potential issue for client-side applications. There's also a comparison to older libraries like Moment.js, which were criticized for being large and mutable, and a preference for the new, immutable API design of Temporal.

Some users engage in technical debates about the API's design, such as why `Temporal.Instant` cannot be constructed from date/time components (it's to avoid ambiguity with time zones and DST) and whether the article's philosophical language about "the fundamental nature of time" is justified (most agree it's just about developer ergonomics). Ultimately, the consensus is that while Temporal is the future, the article is premature, and developers must rely on polyfills for the foreseeable future.

## [LLVM: The bad parts](https://www.npopov.com/2026/01/11/LLVM-The-bad-parts.html)
**Score:** 347 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46588837

> **Article:** The article "LLVM: The bad parts" by Nikita Popov (author of the PHP JIT) critiques the LLVM compiler infrastructure, focusing on its complexity, instability, and performance pitfalls. Key issues highlighted include:

*   **Instability:** The internal C++ APIs are highly unstable, making it difficult for frontends (like PHP) to keep up with new LLVM versions. While the C API offers some stability, it is incomplete and not always consistent.
*   **Compilation Speed:** LLVM has become significantly slower over time, with massive memory usage during compilation, particularly for debug builds.
*   **Optimization Bugs:** The article details specific optimization bugs, such as Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM) creating excessive register pressure, which paradoxically slows down code.
*   **Documentation & Testing:** There is a lack of clear documentation for backend components (like SelectionDAG) and a shortage of comprehensive, IR-level test suites, making it hard to develop or maintain custom backends.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's claims, with contributors sharing their own experiences with LLVM's complexity and maintenance challenges. The conversation centers on three main themes:

*   **Compilation Performance:** Users confirmed that LLVM's build times and memory consumption have grown significantly, with some noting that 8GB of RAM is no longer sufficient for a comfortable build. Alternatives like Mozilla's Cranelift were mentioned as faster, albeit less feature-rich, options.
*   **Optimization and Safety:** There was a debate on the safety implications of using a complex, unauditable compiler for "safe" languages like Rust. While some argued this undermines Rust's guarantees, others noted that the Rust project actively contributes to fixing LLVM bugs, benefiting the entire ecosystem.
*   **Developer Experience and Stability:** Several commenters, including those maintaining LLVM-based projects, agreed that the unstable C++ APIs and poor documentation for backend components make development difficult. There was a call for better testing infrastructure and more "knobs" for frontend authors to tune optimization passes, rather than relying on LLVM's default heuristics.

## [The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you (2024) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0mLhHDcY3I)
**Score:** 249 | **Comments:** 228 | **ID:** 46593395

> **Article:** The article is a YouTube video titled "The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you." The video likely demonstrates the surprising and high difficulty of the in-flight chess game, contrasting its expected casual nature with a challenging, almost unbeatable AI opponent. The title suggests the bot is far more powerful than a typical passenger would anticipate, potentially leading to a frustrating experience for those expecting a simple game.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant and amusing contradiction in users' experiences with the Delta Air Lines chess bot, leading to speculation about why its difficulty varies so drastically.

The core debate is whether the bot is laughably easy or impossibly difficult. Several users, including a self-described 1600-2000 ELO player, claim to have beaten it easily, with one suggesting the bot makes random blunders. Conversely, other skilled players (one rated 2100) report being "destroyed" every time, noting the bot plays with perfect opening theory and makes no blunders. A user who is "bad at chess" found the "easy" mode trivial, while another who played it years ago found it insane that it could beat them on easy.

This discrepancy is explained by a compelling technical theory: the bot's difficulty was likely set by limiting its thinking time (e.g., "think for only a second"). As airplane processing power has vastly improved over the years, the same one-second limit now allows the engine to perform a much deeper analysis, effectively turning an "easy" setting into a grandmaster-level opponent. This phenomenon is compared to a bug in the macOS Chess app where a disabled difficulty slider combined with faster hardware made the game unbeatable. The discussion also humorously touches on a user confusing poker with blackjack and a joke that Turkish Airlines' easy bot is intentionally weak to make passengers feel smart.

## [Windows 8 Desktop Environment for Linux](https://github.com/er-bharat/Win8DE)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46588132

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for a project named "Win8DE", which is a desktop environment for Linux designed to replicate the "Metro" or "Modern UI" of Windows 8. The project is a theme or shell implementation that brings the tile-based, touch-focused interface of the controversial Microsoft OS to the Linux ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a nostalgic but divided reflection on the legacy of Windows 8's user interface. Many commenters express genuine appreciation for the Metro UI, praising its simplicity, speed, and fluidity, particularly on touch devices like Windows Phones. They view it as an underrated and forward-thinking design that Microsoft unfortunately abandoned.

However, this praise is contrasted by strong negative memories from users who experienced it on traditional desktops. The primary complaints were the jarring full-screen "Start Menu" takeover and the loss of contextual workflow, which many found disruptive and overwhelming on large monitors. A key point of contention is whether the UI was truly innovative, with some arguing that similar tile-based designs existed in shareware long before Windows 8.

Regarding the Linux project itself, opinions are mixed. While some are excited by the novelty and potential for tablets, others are skeptical, expressing a common belief that hobbyist FOSS projects often fail to deliver the polished user experience and non-technical UX required for a desktop environment. The conversation also touches on a desire for clones of other Windows versions, like Windows 7, and a critique that a true recreation would require the underlying application framework (XAML/WinRT), not just the visual theme.

## [X Didn't Fix Grok's 'Undressing' Problem. It Just Makes People Pay for It](https://www.wired.com/story/x-didnt-fix-groks-undressing-problem-it-just-makes-people-pay-for-it/)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46592827

> **Article:** A Wired article reports that X's (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot Grok continues to generate non-consensual "undressing" images and deepfakes, despite previous controversies. The article argues that rather than fixing the problem, X has effectively commercialized it by requiring users to pay for the ability to generate such content at scale. This has led to a flood of misogynistic and racist deepfakes being posted publicly, making the platform hostile for targeted groups and making it harder to track the abuse because the content is now behind a paywall.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Grok's functionality and X's handling of the issue, with several key themes emerging. A central point of debate is the comparison of Grok to traditional tools like Photoshop. Many commenters argue this comparison is disingenuous; while Photoshop is a manual tool, Grok automates the creation of harmful content and posts it publicly on a platform, lowering the barrier to abuse and enabling harassment at scale. The discussion highlights that the problem isn't just the tool's capability, but its integration into a social media platform where the output is used as a weapon.

There is significant skepticism towards the article's claim that Grok is now a paid-only feature, with one user pointing out that the free version still exists, but the integration with X's public reply system was turned off, which ironically makes the abuse harder to track. Commenters also note that other AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini have similar capabilities, but they are not designed to post outputs publicly, which is the crucial difference that enables the harassment on X.

The conversation also touches on the broader ethical and corporate responsibility aspects. Users express dismay at the platform's inconsistent content moderation, contrasting the banning of terms like "cisgender" with the allowance of CSAM and abusive deepfakes. The consensus is that while AI misuse may be inevitable on a local level, a corporation profiting from a tool that automates non-consensual sexual imagery is indefensible. The discussion concludes with a sense of futility about "putting a finger in the dike," acknowledging that as local AI models become more powerful, the responsibility of platforms to prevent abuse becomes even more critical.

## [Zen-C: Write like a high-level language, run like C](https://github.com/z-libs/Zen-C)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46587804

> **Article:** Zen-C is a new programming language that aims to provide the productivity of a high-level language while compiling to readable C for performance and compatibility. Its syntax is heavily inspired by Rust, featuring constructs like `var` for declarations, traits, tagged unions, and pattern matching. The project is very new, with the initial commit being less than a day old at the time of the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Zen-C was largely skeptical and analytical, questioning its purpose and place in the current programming language landscape. The key points of the conversation were:

*   **Syntax and Inspiration:** Commenters immediately noted the language's strong resemblance to Rust, with some calling it "Rust for people who are allergic to using Rust." A minor point of contention was the use of PascalCase for types (e.g., `I8`, `F32`), which felt inconsistent with the otherwise Rust-like syntax.

*   **Purpose and Necessity:** The primary question was "why?" Many argued that if one desires high-level features and performance, they should just use Rust or Zig directly. Compiling to C was seen by some as an odd choice when compiling to Rust or native assembly is possible, though others pointed out that using C as an intermediate language leverages decades of compiler optimization and tooling.

*   **Potential Advantages:** A few distinct benefits were identified for the C compilation strategy:
    *   **Ecosystem Access:** It provides a bridge to C's massive ecosystem of third-party libraries.
    *   **Tooling:** It can leverage existing C-based verification and analysis tools.
    *   **Portability:** It has a minimal runtime requirement, making it suitable for bare-metal or embedded systems where implementing a new runtime would be difficult.
    *   **Incremental Adoption:** It could allow teams to introduce a modern language into an existing C codebase incrementally.

*   **Precedents and Comparisons:** Several users compared Zen-C to other transpiling languages like Nim, Vala, and Crystal, noting that this is a well-established concept. It was also compared to Zig, which shares many of the same goals (C interoperability, comptime, manual memory management with ergonomics).

*   **Project Status:** The project's extreme newness was a major topic. Its rapid gain of stars led to speculation about bots or pre-launch marketing. The author's high commit activity was acknowledged, but the project is clearly in a very early, experimental phase.

**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46595419

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica reports that Google has removed some of its AI-generated health summaries from search results following an investigation that revealed "dangerous and alarming" flaws. The AI overviews were found to provide incorrect, fabricated, or potentially harmful medical information, putting users' health at risk. The article references a Guardian investigation as the original source. This incident is framed as a significant setback for Google's AI integration into its core search product, particularly in a high-stakes field like healthcare where accuracy is critical.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Google's AI implementation, with commenters expressing a general loss of trust in the search engine. The conversation revolves around several key themes:

*   **The Dangers of AI in Healthcare:** There is a strong consensus that healthcare is a uniquely sensitive domain where the "disruption" of AI carries life-and-death risks. Users shared personal anecdotes of the AI providing dangerously wrong information about medications, reinforcing the need for "human-in-the-loop" systems rather than full automation.

*   **Widespread Inaccuracy and "Hallucinations":** Beyond health, users cited numerous other examples of the AI summaries failing. These included mixing fan fiction with factual information for game queries (Minecraft), confidently promoting scams (fake Tesla wheelchair), and providing useless or generic summaries for weather data. This has led to a perception that the feature actively degrades the quality of search results.

*   **Erosion of Trust in Google Search:** Many commenters lamented the decline of Google Search, arguing that AI summaries, combined with aggressive advertising and SEO spam, have made the service unreliable. The sentiment is that users are now forced to scroll past AI-generated nonsense to find legitimate sources, with some stating they only use Google as a URL-finder for sites they already know exist.

*   **Corporate Responsibility and Liability:** The discussion touched on the legal ramifications of AI in medicine, with one user pointing out that such systems could be classified as "Software as a Medical Device" (SaMD), which carries significant liability. This contrasts with OpenAI's more cautious, dedicated "ChatGPT Health" launch, suggesting different safety approaches among tech companies.

Overall, the HN community reacted with deep skepticism and frustration, viewing the flawed AI summaries as a reckless product that undermines Google's core utility and trustworthiness.

## [Statement from Federal Reserve Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm?mod=ANLink)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 28 | **ID:** 46589489

> **Article:** The article is a transcript of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the American Economic Association's annual meeting. In the speech, Powell discusses the current state of the U.S. economy, highlighting strong labor markets and moderating economic growth. He reiterates the Federal Reserve's commitment to its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Powell states that the Federal Reserve is carefully assessing incoming economic data and the evolving outlook for inflation and the labor market, indicating that the pace of future adjustments to the policy rate will be dependent on the balance of risks. He concludes by affirming that the Federal Reserve is resolved to use its tools to achieve its dual mandate and to keep long-term inflation expectations anchored.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell's leadership, largely focusing on the perception of institutional failure and a lack of accountability. A central theme is the deep skepticism towards official economic data. Several commenters argue that official inflation and unemployment figures are manipulated or inaccurate, citing personal experience with high grocery prices as evidence that the "real" inflation rate is much higher than reported. This distrust extends to a belief that the Fed's models are flawed and that the institution has failed in its core mission.

Another major point of contention is the "transitory" inflation narrative from 2020-2021. Commenters point to this as a key example of the Fed's incompetence and poor judgment, which they argue led to a subsequent aggressive tightening cycle that caused widespread layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, from which they feel the sector has not fully recovered.

The discussion also touches on the political maneuvering surrounding Powell's term. Commenters note that while his term as Chair is ending, he still has time left as a Governor on the board. They speculate that the incoming administration's desire to remove him early is driven by a desire for control and "revenge" for past perceived slights, rather than any specific policy disagreement. The conversation concludes with a sense of cynicism about the entire system, viewing Fed officials as self-serving figures protected by long terms and revolving doors, with little to no real accountability for their decisions.

## [Show HN: AI in SolidWorks](https://www.trylad.com)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46591100

> **Project:** The project, "AI in SolidWorks," is a tool that integrates AI (specifically LLMs like Claude) to assist with CAD modeling via a natural language interface. The goal is to automate tedious tasks and lower the barrier to entry for using complex software like SolidWorks. The project is presented as an exploration of whether current LLMs can effectively handle the spatial reasoning and specific API calls required for CAD, rather than a fully polished product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a mix of technical critique, shared experiences, and broader philosophical questions about AI's role in CAD. A central theme is the current limitations of LLMs in spatial reasoning. Users point out specific flaws in the project's demo, such as incorrect fillets and, more fundamentally, a poor understanding of 3D space. The creator confirms this, noting that LLMs struggle with basic decisions like choosing the correct plane for a sketch and often fail when trying to write code using SolidWorks' native API.

However, the conversation reveals a workaround that several users find promising: using LLMs to generate high-level instructions which are then translated into concrete actions by a separate, more structured process (e.g., a "CLI" or another LLM). One commenter detailed their success with this approach in Altium (a PCB design tool), using LLMs for monotonous tasks like labeling and setting up design rules, effectively creating a "copilot" rather than a fully autonomous designer.

This led to a debate on the viability of startups in this space, with many noting that the technical barrier is low enough for individuals to bootstrap their own solutions, questioning the long-term defensibility of such businesses. The discussion also touched on user interface, with skepticism that text is the ideal input for 3D modeling, and a shared frustration with the high cost and stagnation of professional software like SolidWorks. Ultimately, the consensus is that while AI won't replace CAD experts soon, it shows significant promise as a tool to handle the most tedious and repetitive aspects of the design workflow.

## [Iran has now been offline for 96 hours](https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/2010750871274160361)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46591974

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter post by NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, reporting that Iran has been offline for 96 hours. This indicates a severe, government-imposed internet blackout, likely in response to widespread civil unrest and protests against the regime.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revolves around the nature of the protests, the effectiveness of the government's internet shutdown, and the geopolitical context.

Commenters express a mix of hope and pessimism regarding the uprising's potential for success. While some are optimistic that the protests could signal the end of the current regime, others are more cautious, pointing out that the Iranian government has a strong ideological base and a solid network of supporters, making a peaceful transition less likely than in other nations.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the technological battle for information. Users discuss the use of Starlink to circumvent the blackout, with reports that the Iranian government is jamming the service, possibly by targeting the GPS signals the dishes rely on. The practical methods for locating and seizing illegal dishes, such as signal triangulation, are also mentioned.

The discussion also becomes highly political, with a prominent counter-narrative arguing that Western powers, particularly the US and Israel, are not genuinely interested in Iranian freedom but are instead orchestrating the protests to achieve regime change for their own geopolitical benefit. This view is supported by a link to a post by journalist Glenn Greenwald. Other comments touch on the grim reality of the situation, the tragic human cost of the crackdown, and the disturbing excitement some feel about the potential "content drop" of videos and images once the internet is restored.

## [Ireland fast tracks Bill to criminalise harmful voice or image misuse](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2026/01/07/call-to-fast-track-bill-targeting-ai-deepfakes-and-identity-hijacking/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46588319

> **Article:** An article in The Irish Times reports that the Irish government is fast-tracking a new bill to criminalize the malicious misuse of a person's voice and image. The legislation is a direct response to a surge in sophisticated AI-generated deepfake scams. These scams often feature cloned voices and likenesses of prominent figures, such as former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Simon Harris, being used in fraudulent advertisements on social media to promote cryptocurrency and other financial scams. The bill aims to create specific criminal offenses for using AI to create harmful content without consent, moving beyond existing fraud or harassment laws to address this new technological threat directly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of skepticism, contextual analysis, and debate over the bill's potential scope and intent. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A significant portion of the discussion is dedicated to providing crucial context that the article only hints at. Multiple users explain that this legislation is not happening in a vacuum but is the result of a "long-standing feud" between social media platforms like Meta and YouTube, and Irish politicians and media. The specific catalyst is the rampant problem of deepfake scam ads featuring figures like Simon Harris, which platforms have been slow to effectively police. This context frames the bill as a targeted response to a specific, high-profile problem rather than a purely abstract legislative exercise.

There is considerable debate and concern over the bill's wording and its potential for overreach. Critics worry that phrases like "reckless as to whether or not harm is caused" and "causes alarm or distress" are dangerously vague. They fear this could be used to stifle legitimate journalism, satire, or criticism, potentially conflicting with freedom of expression rights. One user pointed out that a newspaper publishing a suspect's photo could arguably fall foul of this law. However, other users countered that the bill's intent is narrower, aimed specifically at preventing misrepresentation for malign purposes, not general reporting.

Finally, the discussion touches on broader philosophical and practical questions about regulating technology. Some users are cynical, suggesting the bill is a political tool to protect politicians' credibility or a disingenuous move by a government that is simultaneously attacking other freedoms. Others argue that criminalizing the *users* of AI tools is a flawed approach, likening it to failed wars on drugs or guns, and that regulation should focus on the technology providers and platforms at the source. The practical difficulty of enforcing such a law against actors in other jurisdictions was also raised as a major challenge.

## [Launch a Debugging Terminal into GitHub Actions](https://blog.gripdev.xyz/2026/01/10/actions-terminal-on-failure-for-debugging/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46587498

> **Article:** The article, "Launch a Debugging Terminal into GitHub Actions," presents a custom tool that allows developers to get an interactive terminal session inside a GitHub Actions runner. The tool works by using a reverse shell and a web-based terminal, enabling users to debug a failing workflow in real-time. The author created this solution to address the lack of a native "debug with SSH" feature in GitHub Actions, which makes troubleshooting complex build failures difficult and time-consuming.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive about the tool itself but uses it as a springboard to criticize GitHub Actions and lament the loss of a key feature from a competitor.

The core praise centers on the utility of interactive debugging. Multiple commenters, including a self-identified author of a similar tool (`tmate`), confirm that this capability is essential for efficiently troubleshooting CI/CD pipelines, saving developers hours of frustration and "commit spam."

However, the conversation quickly pivots to a broader critique of GitHub Actions. A recurring and powerful theme is the comparison to CircleCI, which offered a native "Rebuild with SSH" feature years ago. Several long-time developers express disappointment that GitHub has not implemented such a "table-stakes" feature, viewing its absence as a major productivity loss and a sign of stagnation.

The discussion also presents alternative approaches:
*   **Self-Hosted Runners:** Some argue this is the ultimate solution, as it provides direct access and better performance. A counterpoint is raised that this doesn't fully solve the problem, as it still doesn't replicate the specific authentication and permissions of the cloud environment.
*   **Existing Tools:** Commenters point to `tmate` as a well-established, easy-to-use alternative for this purpose.
*   **Reproducibility:** One user suggests the best practice is to make workflows entirely reproducible locally (e.g., with Dagger) to avoid the need for remote debugging altogether.

Finally, there are mentions of security concerns, frustration with YAML-based CI configurations, and a user noting that GitLab already has a similar "interactive web terminal" feature.

## [Chromium Has Merged JpegXL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7184969)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46597927

> **Article:** The article links to a Chromium code review entry confirming that the JPEG XL (JpegXL) image format has been merged into the main Chromium source code. This marks the official inclusion of the next-generation image format into the browser engine that powers Chrome and other major browsers, signaling a significant step toward its widespread adoption.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the long and contentious history of JpegXL adoption in Chromium, the technical and strategic reasons for the delay, and a comparison of JpegXL with its competitors, WebP and AVIF.

Key points from the discussion include:

*   **Reasons for Past Reluctance:** Users debated why Chromium resisted JpegXL for years. One user pointed to the original C++ library being unmaintained and a potential security risk. This was countered by the suggestion that Google's primary argument was strategic: they believed one new format (pitting JpegXL against AVIF) was sufficient, and adding multiple formats unnecessarily increased the browser's attack surface. A user also recalled that Google had previously claimed there wasn't enough interest to justify inclusion.

*   **The Rust Implementation as a Turning Point:** A major breakthrough was the development of `jxl-rs`, a new, memory-safe implementation of the JpegXL decoder written in Rust. This addressed the critical security concerns and made the format a viable option for a security-conscious browser like Chrome.

*   **Format Comparisons (Performance vs. Support):**
    *   **JpegXL vs. WebP/AVIF:** JpegXL is praised for being "flat out better" than WebP in both compression and speed. AVIF is noted for excellent compression but is often criticized for being extremely slow to encode, though one user clarified that this can be mitigated by adjusting CPU usage parameters.
    *   **Pragmatism vs. Progress:** A practical counterpoint was raised that for many users, the "boring" and universally supported JPEG and WebP formats are sufficient and more reliable, as new formats often face software compatibility issues.

*   **Features:** The new implementation is confirmed to support key advanced features, including animation, progressive decoding, wide color gamut, and HDR.
