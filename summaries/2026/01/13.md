## [Apple Creator Studio](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/)
**Score:** 321 | **Comments:** 281 | **ID:** 46601157

> **Article:** Apple announced "Apple Creator Studio," a new subscription service that bundles its suite of professional creative applications. For a monthly or annual fee, users get access to Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage. The subscription also includes new AI features and premium content for Apple's iWork suite (Keynote, Pages, and Numbers).

The service is offered in two tiers: a standard price ($12.99/month or $129/year) that includes family sharing, and a significantly discounted educational tier ($2.99/month or $29.99/year) for verified students and educators. Apple will continue to offer all the core Mac apps (excluding iWork) as separate, one-time purchases on the Mac App Store for users who prefer not to subscribe. The service is set to launch on January 28th.
>
> **Discussion:** The announcement sparked a multifaceted debate among Hacker News users, centered on Apple's business strategy, the value of the bundle, and the broader context of its professional software ecosystem.

A primary theme was the reaction to the subscription model. While some users immediately viewed this as Apple emulating Adobe's unpopular subscription practices, others pointed out that this is an addition to, not a replacement for, existing one-time purchase options. The affordability of the bundle, especially the steep educational discount, was widely seen as a strong value proposition, though some questioned the utility for individuals who only need one or two of the applications.

Discussion also touched on Apple's competitive positioning. Commenters saw this as a direct challenge to Adobe's creative suite dominance, and potentially Microsoft's as well, though the iWork apps were considered a minor part of the offering.

A significant and critical thread emerged regarding Apple's "pro" software development, specifically the lack of an Xcode for iPadOS. This led to a broader critique of the iPad's identity crisis—caught between being a simple, locked-down device and a potential Mac replacement. Commenters argued that Apple's strict code-signing and containerization rules make a true development environment on the iPad impossible, a problem they see reflected in the stalled updates for Swift Playgrounds and the limitations of the Vision Pro for development.

Finally, there was some skepticism about the long-term health of Apple's pro apps, with users noting the long gaps between major updates for some software and lamenting the discontinuation of older, beloved applications like Aperture. However, others countered that apps like Logic Pro still receive meaningful updates.

## [Chromium Has Merged JpegXL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7184969)
**Score:** 320 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46597927

> **Article:** The article reports that Chromium (the open-source project behind Chrome, Edge, and other browsers) has officially merged support for the JPEG XL image format. This is a significant reversal of a 2021 decision by Google to remove JPEG XL support from Chrome, citing a lack of user interest and the existence of other modern formats like WebP and AVIF. The merge means that JPEG XL will be available in future versions of Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, enabling features like progressive loading, HDR, wide color gamut, and animation support.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive, with many users celebrating the long-awaited addition of JPEG XL. The community explores the reasons for the years-long delay, the technical capabilities of the new format, and its practical implications.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **Reasons for the Reversal:** Commenters point to two main factors for Chromium's change of heart. First, the original C++ JPEG XL library was seen as unmaintained and a potential security risk. The adoption of a new, memory-safe implementation written in Rust (jxl-rs) is believed to have alleviated these security concerns. Second, some users recall Google previously citing a "lack of interest," suggesting that community pressure and the format's proven merits eventually won out.
*   **Format Comparisons and Performance:** There is a general consensus that JPEG XL is a superior format. It is described as "Pareto-optimal," offering better compression than WebP at similar quality levels, while also being faster to encode than AVIF. Users note that while AVIF offers excellent compression, its encoding speed can be prohibitively slow without careful tuning, whereas WebP is very fast. JPEG XL is seen as the ideal successor to both JPEG and PNG.
*   **Practicality and Adoption:** Some users express hesitation, remembering the difficult transition period for WebP, where files were often incompatible with older software. However, others counter that WebP is now universally supported and that JPEG XL has a better chance of rapid adoption, especially with Microsoft already providing a JPEG XL extension for Windows.
*   **Other Concerns:** A few side-topics were raised, including the fact that the official JPEG XL specification is behind a paywall (a common complaint for ISO standards), and a debate on whether Rust's memory safety truly guarantees security or can lead to developer overconfidence.

## [The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you (2024) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0mLhHDcY3I)
**Score:** 317 | **Comments:** 316 | **ID:** 46593395

> **Article:** The article is a YouTube video titled "The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you." The video likely demonstrates the surprisingly high difficulty of the chess game available on Delta's in-flight entertainment system. The title suggests that the bot is much stronger than passengers might expect from an airplane game, potentially leading to frustratingly quick defeats for casual players.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the surprisingly high difficulty of the Delta Air Lines chess bot, with users sharing conflicting experiences and theories. The key points of debate are:

*   **Conflicting Experiences:** There is a significant split in user reports. Some, including a 2000-rated player, found the bot to be weak, describing it as making random moves or occasional blunders that are easy to exploit. Conversely, other skilled players (including a 2100-rated user) report being "destroyed" by the same bot, which they claim plays opening theory perfectly and never blunders.

*   **The "Hardware Upgrade" Theory:** The most prominent theory to explain this discrepancy is that the bot's difficulty was originally set based on the processing power of older in-flight systems. As airlines upgraded the hardware over the years, the same software, now running on much faster processors, became exponentially stronger. This is compared to the macOS Chess app, which became notoriously difficult after an update, and the historical "Turbo button" on PCs used to slow down games for compatibility.

*   **Difficulty Scaling:** Users discuss how difficulty is typically scaled in chess AI. One user notes that it's often done by limiting the search depth or thinking time. If this is based on a fixed time (e.g., "think for 1 second"), a faster CPU will perform a much deeper search, making the bot far stronger than intended.

*   **Anecdotes and Jokes:** The discussion is peppered with related anecdotes, such as a user confusing poker with blackjack, and jokes about the bot being a person hidden under the floorboards. One user also mentions finding a sequence of moves that reliably crashes the game.

## [Scott Adams has died](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2026/01/13/scott-adams-dead-dilbert-creator-prostate-cancer/88158828007/)
**Score:** 315 | **Comments:** 189 | **ID:** 46603431

> **Article:** USA Today reports the death of Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, at the age of 69. The cause of death was prostate cancer, which had metastasized. The article notes Adams's significant cultural impact through Dilbert, which satirized corporate life for decades, as well as the controversies in his later years regarding his public statements.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by a complex mix of nostalgia for Dilbert's cultural impact and sharp criticism of Scott Adams's later-life behavior. While many commenters express sadness and share personal anecdotes about how the comic resonated with them in corporate environments, the conversation quickly pivots to Adams's controversial legacy.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **The Dichotomy of Creator and Creation:** Many users struggle to reconcile their appreciation for Dilbert's humor with their disdain for Adams's personal views. One highly upvoted comment describes Adams as a "complicated" figure, akin to family, whose positive contributions (humor, systems thinking) must be acknowledged alongside his "ugliness" (racism, grievance).
*   **The Decline of Adams's Public Persona:** There is a widespread sentiment that Adams "went completely off the rails" in his later years. Users debate the cause, suggesting it might be related to his divorce, the loss of his son to a fentanyl overdose, or simply that he stopped suppressing opinions he always held. The consensus is that his public provocations alienated many of his former fans.
*   **Dilbert's Cultural Significance:** Older users reminisce about the strip's peak influence in the 90s and 2000s, noting it was a "shared language" for office workers. The presence of Dilbert comics on office walls was seen as a litmus test for a company's self-awareness and sense of humor.
*   **Early Signs of Eccentricity:** Some commenters pointed out that Adams's unconventional and "lunatic" thinking (such as alternative theories of gravity and belief in manifestation) was evident in his books as far back as the 1990s, long before his more recent political controversies.

## [Local Journalism Is How Democracy Shows Up Close to Home](https://buckscountybeacon.com/2026/01/opinion-local-journalism-is-how-democracy-shows-up-close-to-home/)
**Score:** 288 | **Comments:** 201 | **ID:** 46600850

> **Article:** The article argues that local journalism is the essential, tangible expression of democracy at the community level. It posits that local reporters and publications are uniquely accountable to their audience, fostering a direct connection between citizens and the information they need to participate in civic life. The piece frames the decline of local news—due to media consolidation and the loss of traditional revenue streams—as a direct threat to the health of local democracy, leaving communities less informed and less engaged.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, treating the decline of local journalism as a critical problem for democratic oversight and community cohesion. The conversation explores the causes of this decline and potential solutions.

A primary theme is the economic unsustainability of local news. Commenters point to the collapse of advertising revenue, particularly classified ads for real estate which were once a cornerstone of local newspaper funding. This loss of a "subsidy" made the core product—attending city council meetings and holding power accountable—no longer financially viable. The discussion contrasts the accountability of small, local outlets with that of large media conglomerates, which can easily shut down a publication without regard for the community.

The conversation then pivots to potential solutions. Several users advocate for treating local journalism as a public good, funded either through direct government grants or a mandatory fee based on municipal budgets. However, this idea is met with skepticism about how to ensure independence and prevent the government from influencing the very journalists meant to hold it accountable. Alternative models discussed include lean, non-profit operations funded by individual patrons (similar to a Patreon model) and leveraging community platforms like Discord or Nextdoor, though the latter is noted to often devolve into gossip and complaints rather than substantive journalism.

Finally, the discussion touches on the quality and bias of existing local news. One commenter argues that local journalism has stagnated, becoming a "shill" for those in power, while another contends that this is an inherent feature of local media, not a new phenomenon. The debate over political bias was also present, with conflicting views on whether local reporting leans left or right.

## [Network of Scottish X accounts go dark amid Iran blackout](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25759181.network-scottish-x-accounts-go-dark-amid-iran-blackout/)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46599574

> **Article:** An article in The Herald reports on a network of fake X (formerly Twitter) accounts, which posed as Scottish individuals, going dark during an internet blackout in Iran. The investigation, originally from the UK Defence Journal, suggests these accounts were part of an Iranian-linked disinformation campaign. The fake personas, named 'Jake', 'Fiona', and 'Lucy', spread outlandish and false claims of political chaos and civil unrest in Scotland, such as the seizure of Balmoral Estate and tanks in Edinburgh. A disinformation analysis firm, Cyabra, claimed that as much as 26% of profiles discussing Scottish independence were fake. The article clarifies that the goal was not to influence Scottish people directly, but to exploit authentic political debates and sow division, potentially to influence audiences in other countries like the US.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this article reveals significant skepticism and a broader conversation about online disinformation. A primary theme is the debate over the campaign's true target audience. While one commenter suggests the goal is to influence Iranians, others argue it's more likely aimed at influencing Americans' perceptions of the UK, or simply to "magnify division and undermine trust in democratic processes" as the original article stated.

There is also considerable skepticism about the source of the report itself. Commenters point out that the information traces back to Cyabra, a Tel-Aviv-based disinformation analysis firm, and question the potential bias of an Israeli firm reporting on Iranian activities, especially amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The discussion quickly broadens to the general nature of online manipulation. Commenters share anecdotes about seeing similar "engagement bait" and misinformation on their own feeds, with one linking to a separate investigation about a Sri Lankan influencer making significant money by posing as a British person posting racist content. The topic of US-based astroturfing is also raised, with a commenter citing a years-old Reddit blog post showing Eglin Air Force Base as a highly "addicted" city to counter the common focus on Russia and China. Finally, there is a meta-discussion about the potential for sock puppet accounts on Hacker News itself, with one user noting that even prominent figures like Marc Andreessen appear to have been radicalized online, suggesting the platform is not immune to such influence.

## [Scott Adams has passed away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_JrOIo3SE)
**Score:** 239 | **Comments:** 271 | **ID:** 46602102

> **Article:** The article is a YouTube video announcing the death of Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip. The video's content is not detailed in the post, but the title serves as the primary news report of his passing. A comment provides a detailed timeline from Wikipedia, stating Adams died at 68 from prostate cancer. It notes that in late 2025, his health declined rapidly, leading to paralysis and heart failure. He publicly sought access to a cancer drug and, in his final podcast on January 1, 2026, indicated he was entering a "month of transition" before entering hospice.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is a complex mix of mourning for the creator of Dilbert and a reckoning with his controversial later years. The central theme is the duality of his legacy: many commenters express sadness and choose to remember him for his brilliant, insightful, and humorous depiction of corporate life, which they credit with teaching them more about business than any formal book. There is a clear sense of loss for his early creative genius.

However, this is frequently contrasted with his more recent political commentary, which several users note came to "overshadow" his work. While some dismiss his political views and still praise Dilbert, others allude to his controversial statements. The discussion also touches on the practicalities of his death, including the timeline of his illness and a comment on the "Boomer junk" that will be left behind. A recurring sentiment is a reflection on mortality and the fleeting nature of fame, noting that a figure once so culturally significant may not be known to younger generations.

## [Anthropic has made a large contribution to the Python Software Foundation](https://discuss.python.org/t/anthropic-has-made-a-large-contribution-to-the-python-software-foundation-and-open-source-security/105694)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46601902

> **Article:** Anthropic has made a large, multi-year financial contribution to the Python Software Foundation (PSF). The donation, reported to be $1.5 million over three years, is specifically earmarked to improve the security of the Python ecosystem, particularly the PyPI package repository. This investment is framed as a contribution from a major beneficiary of the Python ecosystem to help secure its critical infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the context, motivations, and implications of the donation. A primary theme was the importance of securing the software supply chain, with commenters noting that PyPI is a major target for attacks, especially when compared to the corporate-backed NPM. The donation was widely seen as a necessary step to bolster the security of a critical but underfunded resource.

There was a debate over the donation's size. Some felt the $1.5 million sum was relatively small for a well-funded company like Anthropic, while others countered that it was a significant and welcome contribution that shouldn't be met with cynicism.

The conversation also delved into the management and funding of the PSF. One commenter criticized the PSF's past decisions, contrasting the acceptance of this private donation with the refusal of a federal grant that had anti-DEI stipulations. This point was rebutted by others, including a Python core developer, who clarified that the PSF rejected the grant precisely to protect its core principles, framing it as a principled stand rather than poor management.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader issues of corporate responsibility in open source, with some commenters arguing that big tech companies that build their products on Python should be contributing more to its maintenance and security.

## [Text-based web browsers](https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/)
**Score:** 229 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46597518

> **Article:** The article "Text-based web browsers" argues that the gap between modern, complex web technologies and the capabilities of text-based browsers (like w3m) is widening, making their future bleak. The author posits that while the web *could* support lightweight, text-only content, it consistently chooses not to in favor of feature-rich, JavaScript-heavy applications. The piece suggests that trying to force the modern web into a text-based experience is a futile effort and that it's better to embrace the web's advanced features (like WASM) for what they are. The author advocates for alternative protocols like Gemini, which are designed from the ground up for text, as a more viable solution for lightweight content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise that the modern web is hostile to text-based browsers. A key point of contention is the recent blocking of the Lynx browser by Google Search, which users see as a major blow to the viability of text browsing. However, the conversation quickly pivots from a eulogy to a celebration of existing, powerful text-based tools.

Several niche but powerful applications are highlighted:
*   **edbrowse:** Praised as a "CLI" (Command-Line Interface) browser, not just a "TUI" (Terminal User Interface). It's lauded for its unique features, including being developed by a blind person (prioritizing accessibility), its scriptability for automation, and its integration of a mail client, IRC client, and SQL client.
*   **chawan:** Noted as a more modern and impressive "real" browser implementation for the terminal, as it handles CSS and JavaScript, unlike simpler alternatives like Browsh which "cheat" by using a backend graphical browser.

The discussion also touches on practical workarounds and developer-side solutions. Users mention using DuckDuckGo's HTML mode as a search engine alternative. On the development front, one commenter suggests using CSS Grid media queries (`@media: grid`) to create layouts optimized for text-based browsers, demonstrating that there are still ways for developers to cater to this niche. The consensus is that while the mainstream web has abandoned text, dedicated tools and communities keep the experience alive and powerful for specific use cases like headless servers, accessibility, and minimalist workflows.

## [Fabrice Bellard's TS Zip (2024)](https://www.bellard.org/ts_zip/)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46593802

> **Article:** Fabrice Bellard has released "ts_zip," a command-line utility that demonstrates text compression using a Large Language Model (LLM). The tool works by leveraging an LLM's ability to predict the next token in a sequence. This prediction is then used with an arithmetic coding algorithm to losslessly compress the original text. The article links to a benchmark showing the tool's performance on standard text compression challenges, highlighting the potential of AI-driven models to achieve high compression ratios by "understanding" the data's structure rather than just finding statistical redundancies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical validity of the benchmark and the underlying mechanics of LLM-based compression. A primary debate was whether the comparison to classical algorithms is fair, as ts_zip relies on a 150MB pre-trained model that is not included in the compressed file size. Commenters noted that standard benchmarks like the Large Text Compression (LTC) benchmark require the total size of the compressed data *plus* the decompressor program to be counted, preventing a "0-byte compressed file" trick. Without including the model's size, ts_zip has an unfair advantage.

However, many users explored the fascinating concept of "compression by understanding." The core mechanism explained was that LLMs produce a probability distribution for the next token, and this distribution is fed into an arithmetic coder for highly efficient, near-fractional-bit encoding. This is contrasted with Huffman coding, which cannot use fractional bits. The consensus was that modern compression is less about the encoding algorithm (which is a solved problem) and more about the quality of the predictive model. Other tangents included the potential for this technique in steganography and humorous anecdotes about the legendary status of the author, Fabrice Bellard.

## [Google removes AI health summaries](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/google-removes-some-ai-health-summaries-after-investigation-finds-dangerous-flaws/)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 145 | **ID:** 46595419

> **Article:** Ars Technica reports that Google has removed some of its AI-generated health summaries from search results following an investigation that found the feature produced "dangerous" and "alarming" inaccuracies. The article references a Guardian report that highlighted specific instances where Google's AI overviews provided flawed medical advice, potentially putting users' health at risk. This move is framed as a significant setback for Google's AI integration into its core search product, especially in a high-stakes domain like healthcare where accuracy is paramount.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Google's AI overviews, with users expressing a lack of trust in the system's accuracy, particularly for health-related queries. Several commenters shared personal anecdotes of the AI providing incorrect information, with one user noting it "hallucinated" details about a medication that were contradicted by official sources. The conversation broadened into a wider critique of Google Search's declining quality, with users complaining that AI summaries often mix factual information with fan theories or misinformation, and that the overall search experience is cluttered with ads and irrelevant results.

A key theme was the debate over the appropriate role for AI in healthcare. While one commenter argued that the focus should be on "human-in-the-loop" applications to augment professionals rather than replace them, another pointed out the practical reality that people are already using tools like ChatGPT for health inquiries. The discussion also touched on regulatory liability, with a mention of FDA rules for "Software as a Medical Device" (SaMD), highlighting the legal risks of deploying such systems.

There was also a meta-discussion about the reporting itself, with one user criticizing the Ars Technica article for omitting the word "some" from its headline, though others defended the article. The conversation concluded with a comparison to OpenAI's newly launched "ChatGPT Health," questioning whether different companies are taking divergent approaches to AI safety in the medical domain.

## [X Didn't Fix Grok's 'Undressing' Problem. It Just Makes People Pay for It](https://www.wired.com/story/x-didnt-fix-groks-undressing-problem-it-just-makes-people-pay-for-it/)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46592827

> **Article:** A Wired article reports that X's (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot Grok has a major "undressing" problem. Despite previous promises to fix it, the platform has instead seemingly monetized the feature by requiring users to pay for X Premium to generate images. The article details how Grok was used to create and publicly post non-consensual deepfake images, particularly targeting women, often in response to their posts. This has turned the replies section of the platform into a stream of misogynistic and racist AI-generated content, making the digital space hostile for targeted groups. The piece argues that by putting this functionality behind a paywall, X is not solving the issue but is effectively making people pay to engage in large-scale, automated harassment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Grok's functionality and X's handling of the issue, with several key themes emerging. A central point of debate is the comparison of Grok to traditional tools like Photoshop. While some argue that the underlying capability to create such images is not new, many others counter that Grok's integration into a social media platform, its ease of use, and its automated, public nature represent a fundamental difference. As one commenter put it, it's the distinction between doing it yourself and a service that will "generate and post" content for you on demand.

There is strong consensus that X's actions—making the feature a paid perk—are irresponsible. Commenters see this not as a fix, but as profiting from harassment. The discussion also highlights the platform's perceived hypocrisy, noting that while X flags the word "cisgender," it allows a tool that facilitates the creation of non-consensual sexual and racist content.

The conversation touches on the broader, intractable nature of the problem. Some users express pessimism, arguing that as AI becomes more powerful and accessible locally, moderation will become impossible. However, this is countered by the view that "inevitability" is not an excuse for corporate negligence. The discussion concludes with a call for accountability, suggesting that companies deploying such easily weaponized tools should be held responsible for the resulting harm, rather than placing the entire burden on individual users.

## [Indifference is a power](https://aeon.co/essays/why-stoicism-is-one-of-the-best-mind-hacks-ever-devised)
**Score:** 164 | **Comments:** 173 | **ID:** 46601121

> **Article:** The article, "Why Stoicism is one of the best mind hacks ever devised," argues for the practical value of Stoicism in the modern world. It presents the philosophy as a powerful mental toolkit for building resilience and managing one's inner state. The core idea is that by focusing only on what we can control (our judgments, reactions, and character) and accepting what we cannot (external events and the actions of others), we can achieve a state of tranquility and effectiveness, regardless of life's circumstances. It frames Stoicism as an "emotional armor" that allows individuals to navigate chaos without being overwhelmed by negative feelings like anxiety, anger, or despair.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted and often critical examination of modern Stoicism, moving beyond the article's simple endorsement. A central theme is the tension between authentic Stoic practice and its popular, often distorted, interpretation. Several users express concern about "pop stoicism," particularly its adoption by "manosphere" types, which they argue re-packages emotional suppression and asocial behavior under a legitimate philosophical banner. This "dissociated" or "fake" Stoicism is seen as a recipe for emotional burnout.

In contrast, a more nuanced view is offered by users like blamestross, who distinguishes between short-term emotional regulation and the crucial long-term work of "going back and feeling those emotions" to integrate them, warning that ignoring this step creates an "emotional debt." This practical advice is complemented by the suggestion to view Stoicism through the lens of modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), as detailed in David Burns' book "Feeling Good," which provides a concrete methodology for the Stoic goal of managing one's interpretations.

The discussion also delves into the philosophy's core tenets. One user critiques Stoicism for potentially lobotomizing ambition by teaching indifference to outcomes, but another counters that it only teaches indifference to things outside one's control, while demanding full commitment to one's actions and values. The dark humor and extreme nature of classical Stoic advice, such as Epictetus's comparison of grieving a wife to a broken cup, is highlighted, with users debating whether this is a profound reframing technique or an unrealistic and potentially harmful ideal. Ultimately, the conversation reveals a community grappling with the gap between Stoicism as a practical, therapeutic tool and its potential for misuse as an excuse for emotional avoidance.

## [The UK is shaping a future of precrime and dissent management (2025)](https://freedomnews.org.uk/2025/04/11/how-the-uk-is-shaping-a-future-of-precrime-and-dissent-management/)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 182 | **ID:** 46600194

> **Article:** The article argues that the UK government is developing a framework for "precrime" and "dissent management" through a convergence of new technologies and legislation. The author points to the rise of predictive policing, which uses data to forecast and prevent crime before it happens, alongside increasingly restrictive laws on protests (such as the Public Order Act) and the use of administrative powers to monitor and suppress dissent. The piece suggests these measures are being justified under the guise of "risk management" and public safety, but they effectively create a system where individuals can be targeted for their potential future actions or perceived threat, rather than actual criminal behavior. This shift, the article warns, moves the UK towards a society where suspicion is enough to warrant intervention, fundamentally altering the relationship between the state and the citizen and chilling free expression.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical and alarmed, framing the UK's proposed measures through the lens of dystopian science fiction and historical warnings. A dominant theme is the comparison to fiction, with numerous users referencing *Black Mirror*, *Minority Report*, and, most prominently, George Orwell's *1984* to highlight the dystopian nature of precrime and dissent management. The conversation also explores the practical and ethical failures of such a system, questioning the reliability of predictive technology and the potential for it to be used to suppress political opposition rather than genuine crime. There is a strong undercurrent of cynicism regarding the government's motives, with commenters suggesting these policies are a way for an unpopular government to maintain control without winning public debate. The classic dilemma of "who watches the watchers" is raised, with suspicion falling on both government and the large tech corporations that provide the data and infrastructure. Finally, some users contextualized the UK's direction as part of a long-term erosion of civil liberties, not just a product of the current administration.

**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 170 | **ID:** 46591974

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter post from NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, reporting that Iran has been offline for 96 hours. This indicates a severe, government-imposed internet blackout in response to widespread civil unrest and protests against the regime.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is multifaceted, reflecting the complexity of the situation. There is a strong sense of concern for the Iranian people, with many commenters expressing that the protests and subsequent crackdown are depressing and wishing the best for the citizens living through a "nightmare." The conversation revolves around several key themes:

*   **The Nature of the Protests and Regime Stability:** Users debate the likelihood of the protests succeeding. Some are hopeful, viewing the events as a potential end for the current regime. Others are more skeptical, pointing out that the Iranian government has a strong ideological base and loyal supporters, making a successful overthrow less likely than in other nations and raising the specter of civil war.

*   **Technological Countermeasures:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the "cat-and-mouse" game of information access. Users discuss the use of Starlink as a potential countermeasure to the internet blackout. However, it's noted that Iran is actively jamming Starlink signals, with speculation that they may be targeting the GPS signals the dishes rely on, and that they might have received technical help from Russia and China. The practicality of finding and seizing dishes on the ground is also mentioned.

*   **Geopolitical Conspiracy Theories:** A prominent and divisive thread is the claim that Western governments, particularly the US and Israel, are orchestrating the protests for their own geopolitical aims—specifically, to install a pro-Israel regime and dominate the Middle East. This view is supported by references to Glenn Greenwald and the history of US foreign policy. This theory is directly challenged by other users who call for reliable sources and point to contradictory evidence, such as the US designating certain groups as terrorists.

*   **Moral and Ethical Observations:** One commenter was criticized for expressing excitement about a potential "huge content drop" of videos and images once the internet is restored, highlighting a tension between morbid curiosity and empathy for those suffering. Another user made a sarcastic comment about children's protests over video games, which was clearly understood as an attempt at dark humor and not a serious comparison.

## [U.S. Emissions Jumped in 2025 as Coal Power Rebounded](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/climate/us-emissions-2025-coal-power.html)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46599079

> **Article:** The New York Times article reports that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2025, reversing a multi-year decline. This rise is attributed primarily to the rebound of coal power for electricity generation. The article suggests that despite the growth of renewable energy, coal remains a significant part of the U.S. energy mix, driven by economic factors and energy demand.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the U.S. emissions increase, with several recurring themes. A significant portion of the comments focuses on international comparisons, particularly with China. While some users attempt to deflect blame by pointing to China's emissions, others counter that China's emissions are trending flat or down and that historical per-capita emissions in the U.S. are far higher. The economic argument for coal is challenged by users who point out the industry's small employment numbers compared to other sectors like yoga instruction, questioning the political motivation for protecting it. There is also skepticism about the purported benefits of AI, with one user's claim that AI provides "tremendous value" being met with criticism about its environmental cost. The discussion also touches on potential solutions, with one user advocating for retrofitting existing coal plants for other fuels as a pragmatic transition strategy, though this is met with skepticism about the source of that information. Finally, some comments express a sense of doom, linking climate change to broader geopolitical instability and war.

## [What a year of solar and batteries saved us in 2025](https://scotthelme.co.uk/what-a-year-of-solar-and-batteries-really-saved-us-in-2025/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46602532

> **Article:** Summary unavailable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's significant energy consumption (over 21 MWh excluding solar), attributing it to his and his wife's two electric vehicles. Several key themes emerged:

*   **Cost and Payback:** While some users debated the 9-11 year payback period, considering factors like inverter replacement and roof longevity, the general sentiment was that it's a reasonable return, comparable to a bond. The author's high electricity usage makes the investment particularly effective.
*   **DIY vs. Professional Installation:** A prominent theme was the falling cost of batteries, with users sharing experiences of building DIY systems for under €100/kWh using Chinese components. However, others cautioned that this is often not permitted for non-certified electricians and can be complex.
*   **Hardware Choices:** Users questioned the prevalence of Tesla Powerwalls, pointing out that alternatives like BYD offer more capacity for a lower price. The idea of using an Electric Vehicle (EV) as a home battery (V2H) was also mentioned as an emerging possibility.
*   **Grid Arbitrage:** A user raised the idea of charging batteries from the grid at off-peak rates and selling back at peak rates, without solar. Commenters noted this is a large-scale commercial strategy and less viable for residential users due to less favorable rate structures with utilities.
*   **Practical Advice and Resources:** For those feeling overwhelmed, users recommended services like EnergySage for getting competitive bids and provided links to tax credit information and non-profit solar advocacy groups.

## [FOSS in times of war, scarcity and (adversarial) AI [video]](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FE7ULY-foss-in-times-of-war-scarcity-and-ai/)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46598991

> **Article:** The article links to a scheduled FOSDEM 2026 talk titled "FOSS in times of war, scarcity and (adversarial) AI." The talk, presented by Michiel Leenaars from NLNet (an EU-funded foundation), argues that the foundational ideals of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are being challenged by modern geopolitical realities. The abstract posits that FOSS is increasingly being weaponized by adversarial states and actors, and that the "naive" belief that openness inherently leads to positive outcomes is no longer viable. It calls for the community to reconsider how it handles trust, security, and the ethics of collaboration in a world where bad actors are state-sponsored and AI can potentially circumvent licensing protections.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revolves around the tension between the idealistic philosophy of FOSS and the pragmatic need for security and ethical enforcement in a hostile world. The central debate is whether FOSS should remain an unrestricted "gift to humanity" or if it needs to evolve to protect itself from misuse.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **The Idealism vs. Reality Debate:** One user argued that FOSS should be given freely without expectation, viewing any attempt to restrict usage as hypocritical. Others countered that this view ignores the reality that FOSS tools are being "weaponized" against the very communities that build them, necessitating a defensive response. The Paradox of Tolerance was cited to argue that unlimited tolerance can lead to the destruction of tolerance itself.
*   **Practical Solutions and Limitations:** A user noted that trying to legislate "good use" through licenses is difficult, especially as AI code generators can now mimic FOSS logic to create "clean room" implementations that bypass license restrictions. Instead of restrictive licenses, they suggested technical solutions like formal proofs, compartmentalization, and zero-trust architectures.
*   **Trust and Social Structures:** While some argued for zero-trust models, another user countered that trust is inevitable; the goal should be to organize it through social structures (like "chain of trust") rather than eliminating it.
*   **Geopolitical Context:** Users noted that the talk's sponsor (NLNet/NGI) is EU-funded, framing the discussion within the context of the EU's stance on adversarial nations. It was pointed out that war makes nationality a factor in collaboration, potentially siloing open-source development along geopolitical lines.
*   **Skepticism and AI Claims:** There was some skepticism regarding the timing of the post (the talk hasn't happened yet) and the premise of the talk. One user made a controversial claim that current AI models are inherently truthful and ethical, which sparked a brief, separate debate about the nature of AI.

Overall, the community acknowledged the validity of the talk's concerns, expressing a mix of sadness that the "techno-optimism" of the past is fading and a search for practical ways to secure the open source ecosystem without abandoning its core principles.

## [Mozilla's open source AI strategy](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-open-source-ai-strategy/)
**Score:** 114 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46599897

> **Article:** Mozilla has announced a new open source AI strategy aimed at building a trustworthy AI ecosystem. The initiative is built on three pillars: 1) **Mozilla.ai**, a platform for developing "agentive AI" applications with a focus on transparency and user control, 2) **Mozilla Data Collective**, an effort to create ethical and transparent data sourcing and licensing models, and 3) **Real-world Deployments**, partnering with organizations to implement these open AI solutions. The strategy is backed by Mozilla Ventures, which invests in responsible AI companies, and aims to provide an alternative to the closed-source, big-tech-dominated AI landscape.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical and skeptical of Mozilla's new AI direction. A dominant sentiment is that Mozilla is neglecting its core product, the Firefox browser, with many commenters demanding the company focus on improving browser performance and features instead of "shitty AI initiatives." There is significant distrust regarding Mozilla's corporate strategy and financial reliance on search engine deals, particularly with Google, with some commenters viewing the AI push as a "grift" or a distraction from their fundamental conflict of interest as a user-focused entity that depends on revenue from Big Tech.

Beyond the browser-focused criticism, users debated the specifics of the AI strategy. Some were skeptical of the "open" nature of the Mozilla.ai platform, labeling it a "closed-source SaaS competitor" to existing tools, while others countered that the underlying tools would be open source. The historical context of Mozilla's impact was also debated, with a correction on the claim that Firefox single-handedly dropped IE's market share to 55%, though it was acknowledged that Firefox was instrumental in breaking IE's monopoly mindset. A few users expressed hope for the initiative, seeing a need for a major foundation to back open source AI, but the overall tone remained one of deep skepticism towards Mozilla's relevance and execution.
