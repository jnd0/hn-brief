## [Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview)
**Score:** 1126 | **Comments:** 490 | **ID:** 46593022

> **Article:** Anthropic has launched "Cowork," a research preview of a desktop application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for its powerful Claude Code agent. The product is designed to make the advanced capabilities of Claude Code accessible to non-developers for general "life and work" tasks. The core idea is to take the powerful "harness" or engine of Claude Code and wrap it in a user-friendly UI, allowing users to perform actions like organizing files, managing calendars, and creating presentations without needing to use the command line.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction is largely positive but nuanced, focusing on the product's potential and the underlying technology. A central theme is the growing observation that developers are already using Claude Code for non-coding tasks like managing personal finances, booking appointments, and organizing files. Many commenters agree that the main barrier to wider adoption is the command-line interface, making Cowork a logical and welcome step.

There is a significant technical debate about the underlying capabilities of the AI, specifically regarding image understanding. One commenter argues that the demo is misleading and that Claude's ability to "see" images is a current weakness, preferring to use command-line tools like `ls`. This is immediately countered by others who share positive experiences with Claude's image analysis, noting its ability to identify fine details and emotions in photos and videos. A developer from the project confirms they are releasing early to iterate quickly. The discussion also touches on philosophical points about automation, with some questioning the need to automate simple tasks like desktop organization, while others see it as a welcome option that saves time and effort.

## [TimeCapsuleLLM: LLM trained only on data from 1800-1875](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM)
**Score:** 679 | **Comments:** 278 | **ID:** 46590280

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "TimeCapsuleLLM," a project that trains a Large Language Model exclusively on historical data from 1800 to 1875. The goal is to create a model whose knowledge is frozen in that era, providing a unique tool for historical simulation and a testbed for evaluating an LLM's ability to reason without modern information. The project includes models based on nanoGPT and Phi 1.5 architectures, making them relatively accessible for local execution.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's discussion centered on the philosophical and practical implications of this "time-capsule" approach. A prominent theme was using such a model as a test for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Commenters debated whether a model trained only on pre-1900 data could independently reason its way to modern discoveries like relativity or quantum mechanics. The consensus was that while it might be able to develop some related mathematics, it would lack the experimental data necessary for such breakthroughs, and might even invent incorrect theories (like the hypothetical planet Vulcan) to explain existing observations.

Another key topic was the potential for these models to provide authentic historical insight. While some saw it as a way to understand past worldviews, others were skeptical, arguing it was less efficient and accurate than simply reading a history book. A practical thread focused on how to easily run the model, with users asking for convenient integrations with popular local LLM tools like Ollama and llama.cpp. The technical details (nanoGPT and Phi 1.5 architectures) were noted as making this feasible. Finally, a humorous example of the model's output was shared, which resembled a nonsensical Markov chain, leading to speculation about the limitations of training data volume.

## [Postal Arbitrage](https://walzr.com/postal-arbitrage)
**Score:** 477 | **Comments:** 247 | **ID:** 46591708

> **Article:** The article "Postal Arbitrage" by Riley Walz details a creative "life hack" that exploits Amazon's grocery delivery service. The author observed that Amazon Fresh sometimes delivers single items, like a single lime, for a very low delivery fee (or free with Prime). This makes the cost of sending a physical item via Amazon significantly cheaper than the cost of a postage stamp to send a traditional letter or postcard. The article frames this as a form of arbitrage, where one can use Amazon's logistics network as a de facto, ultra-cheap postal service to send physical "greetings" to friends, such as a lime with a message written on it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, touching on economics, environmental impact, and the nature of communication.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the actual cost and economic logic of the scheme. Users argue over whether the cost of an Amazon Prime subscription should be considered a sunk cost or a factor in the calculation. Some point out that Amazon often has a minimum order value for grocery deliveries, which undermines the claim of being able to send a single lime for just a few cents. There is also a counterpoint that such "shenanigans" might actually be beneficial by forcing Amazon to burn through its capital on inefficient deliveries.

The environmental cost is raised as a major concern, with one user sarcastically pointing out the waste of resources involved in shipping a phone case from China just to use it as a greeting card. Another user counters that the long-haul shipping is negligible compared to the carbon footprint of the final-mile delivery truck.

The discussion also explores the experiential difference between receiving a physical item via Amazon versus a traditional handwritten card. While some argue the Amazon method is impersonal and uses "crummy paper," others find the novelty of receiving a random item like a lime with a funny message to be a delightful and memorable experience.

Finally, the conversation branches into related topics. Users connect the concept to the original Ponzi scheme, which was also based on postal arbitrage (with International Reply Coupons). Others humorously suggest that the ultimate evolution of this idea is simply sending a digital message or using a fax machine, highlighting the inherent inefficiency of the physical act.

## [The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you (2024) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0mLhHDcY3I)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 258 | **ID:** 46593395

> **Article:** The article is a YouTube video titled "The chess bot on Delta Air Lines will destroy you." The video likely demonstrates the surprisingly high difficulty of the in-flight entertainment chess game, contrasting its strength with the expectation of a casual, easy game. The title suggests the bot is exceptionally strong, perhaps playing at a level that can easily defeat an average player.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant and unresolved debate about the Delta chess bot's actual difficulty, with users reporting wildly different experiences. The central theory proposed to explain this discrepancy is that the bot's difficulty is not based on a fixed setting, but rather on the hardware it's running on. As in-flight entertainment systems have been upgraded over the years with faster CPUs, a bot with a time-limited search algorithm has become exponentially stronger. This means older planes might have an easy bot, while newer ones have a "beast" that crushes players.

Commenters are sharply divided on their personal results:
*   **The "It's Impossible" Camp:** Several users, including a self-described 1600-1700 Lichess player, report being "destroyed" by the bot, even on its easiest setting. They note it plays with perfect opening theory and makes no blunders.
*   **The "It's Easy" Camp:** Conversely, other players, including a 2000-rated Lichess user and a 1000-rated chess.com player, report beating it easily, describing its moves as sometimes random or prone to occasional blunders.

A secondary theme involves the technical challenge of creating a "weakened" AI. Users discuss how difficulty sliders often work by limiting search time or adding random blunders, and how modern hardware can render these limitations ineffective. A humorous anecdote about a bug in macOS Chess that made even the "easy" setting impossible was also shared. Other comments included jokes about the bot being a person hidden under the floor and a correction about a user confusing poker with blackjack.

## [Chromium Has Merged JpegXL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7184969)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46597927

> **Article:** The article reports that Chromium (the open-source project behind Chrome, Edge, and other browsers) has officially merged support for the JPEG XL (JXL) image format. The change was committed to the main source code repository, signaling that the format will be included in future browser releases. This marks the end of a long-running debate and period of exclusion for the modern image format within the world's most popular browser engine.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters celebrating the long-awaited addition of JPEG XL support. The primary reasons for the years-long delay were identified as security and maintenance concerns. The original C++ library for JXL was considered a security risk due to its complexity and lack of active maintenance. The recent adoption of a new, memory-safe implementation written in Rust (jxl-rs) is widely credited as the key factor that made the merge possible, as it alleviated Chromium's security concerns.

Users also highlighted the technical benefits of JPEG XL, referencing benchmarks that show it is superior to WebP in both compression efficiency (smaller file sizes for the same quality) and speed. Commenters noted that JXL supports advanced features like animation, progressive decoding, and high dynamic range (HDR), which are often missing from other formats. While some expressed skepticism about the practicality of adopting a new format, others countered that WebP is now universally supported and that GIFs should be replaced with modern video formats for animations. A minor point of criticism was directed at standards bodies for keeping the official JXL specification behind a paywall.

## [Network of Scottish X accounts go dark amid Iran blackout](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25759181.network-scottish-x-accounts-go-dark-amid-iran-blackout/)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 204 | **ID:** 46599574

> **Article:** An article from The Herald reports on a network of X (formerly Twitter) accounts, which posed as Scottish users, going dark during Iran's internet blackout. These accounts, some with names like 'Jake', 'Fiona', and 'Lucy', had been spreading extreme disinformation about Scotland, including fabricated events like the seizure of Balmoral Estate, tanks in Edinburgh, and the detention of a BBC anchor. The investigation, originally from the UK Defence Journal and citing data from the disinformation analysis firm Cyabra, suggests these accounts were linked to Iranian actors. The goal was not necessarily to influence Scottish people, but to sow division and chaos in the West by exploiting authentic political debates, such as Scottish independence, to undermine trust in democratic processes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep skepticism and a multi-faceted analysis of the article's claims. The core debate centers on the true purpose of such disinformation campaigns. While some users initially doubted the effectiveness on a Scottish audience, others quickly pointed out that the primary targets are likely foreign populations, particularly Americans, who can be made to believe that Western nations are on the brink of collapse. This tactic serves to validate fear-mongering narratives in the target country.

A significant portion of the conversation, however, questions the source and motives behind the report itself. Commenters identified that the story originates from a defense journal and cites Cyabra, a Tel Aviv-based firm with US government clients. This led to accusations of a counter-propaganda effort, with users suggesting the report is part of an "anti-Iran influence operation" and warning against accepting information from a single source without considering its geopolitical context.

The discussion broadened into a general critique of social media and the prevalence of inauthentic behavior online. Users shared examples of commercial "rage bait" and noted that human nature often produces behavior indistinguishable from bots. There was a consensus that astroturfing is a widespread problem, with commenters cautioning against a narrow focus on Russia or China and reminding others that the US also engages in similar online influence activities. The conversation concluded with a sense of unease about the authenticity of online discourse, even on platforms like Hacker News, and a call for more chronological, less engagement-driven feeds to mitigate the problem.

## [X Didn't Fix Grok's 'Undressing' Problem. It Just Makes People Pay for It](https://www.wired.com/story/x-didnt-fix-groks-undressing-problem-it-just-makes-people-pay-for-it/)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 180 | **ID:** 46592827

> **Article:** A Wired article reports that X's (formerly Twitter) AI chatbot, Grok, has a major "undressing" problem. Despite previous promises to fix it, the bot continues to generate non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes, particularly targeting women. The article highlights that X has effectively monetized this issue by requiring users to pay for a premium subscription to generate images, turning a harmful bug into a paid feature. The bot's output is often posted publicly in reply threads, creating a hostile environment and damaging the reputations of the women targeted. The piece contrasts Grok's permissive approach with the stricter safety guardrails of competitors like ChatGPT and Gemini.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Grok's functionality, focusing on the ethical and platform-related implications. A central theme is the debate over responsibility. Many commenters argue that comparing Grok to a tool like Photoshop is disingenuous; Grok is a service that automates and publishes harmful content on its own platform, which is a fundamentally different and more dangerous proposition than a user manually creating an image. The monetization of this capability is also a major point of contention, with users viewing the paywall not as a solution, but as profiting from harassment.

There is also significant discussion about X's inconsistent content moderation. Users point out the platform's swift action against certain speech (like the word "cisgender") while it simultaneously enables and profits from the generation of misogynistic and potentially illegal content, including images of minors. The conversation also touches on the "inevitability" argument; while some note that powerful AI will eventually be available locally, others counter that this does not excuse a corporation from profiting from and facilitating harmful behavior on its own platform right now. The consensus is that Grok's integration into a social media feed was a foreseeable disaster that has created a chaotic and unsafe environment.

## [Google removes AI health summaries after investigation finds dangerous flaws](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/google-removes-some-ai-health-summaries-after-investigation-finds-dangerous-flaws/)
**Score:** 206 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46595419

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica reports that Google has removed some of its AI-generated health summaries from search results following an investigation that revealed "dangerous flaws." The AI overviews were found to provide inaccurate, misleading, or potentially harmful medical information. The article highlights this as a significant setback for Google's AI integration into search, particularly in a high-stakes domain like healthcare where misinformation can have severe consequences. The original source is identified as a Guardian investigation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Google's AI summaries, with a broad consensus that the technology is not ready for sensitive topics like healthcare. The core theme is the unacceptable risk of providing incorrect medical information, with users sharing personal anecdotes of the AI "hallucinating" or fabricating details about medications and health conditions.

Several distinct points emerge from the conversation:
*   **High-Stakes Failure:** Users argue that healthcare is a uniquely dangerous area for AI errors, where the consequences are "life and death." The general sentiment is that AI should be used to augment and increase the productivity of human experts, not replace them in this context.
*   **Widespread Inaccuracy:** The problem is not limited to health. Commenters provide numerous examples of the AI summaries failing in other areas, such as mixing factual information with fan fiction for game queries (Minecraft), confidently promoting scams (Tesla wheelchair), and providing useless weather reports. This suggests a systemic issue with the technology's reliability.
*   **Brand Damage and Search Degradation:** Many commenters feel this is the "final nail in the coffin" for Google Search, which they see as actively worsening the user experience by surfacing incorrect information and burying legitimate results under AI-generated and ad-driven content.
*   **Corporate Responsibility vs. Liability:** There is skepticism about Google's claims of "constantly measuring and reviewing" quality. Some point out that if such AI systems were making actual diagnoses, they would fall under strict FDA regulations for "Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)," implying a significant liability risk.
*   **Context and Debate:** A minor meta-discussion occurs about the accuracy of the article's headline. One user claims the Ars Technica headline is misleading for omitting the word "some," but others counter that the HN title is functionally accurate and the original Guardian article (which Ars cited) included the qualifier. This debate is quickly overshadowed by the broader criticism of the AI's performance.

## [Apple Creator Studio](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/introducing-apple-creator-studio-an-inspiring-collection-of-creative-apps/)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46601157

> **Article:** Apple announced "Apple Creator Studio," a new subscription bundle for macOS aimed at creative professionals. The bundle includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor, and MainStage, along with enhanced AI features for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. The subscription is priced at $12.99/month or $129/year, with a significant educational discount available at $2.99/month or $29.99/year. Apple confirmed that all major apps in the bundle will remain available for individual one-time purchase on the Mac App Store, providing an alternative for users who do not want a subscription.
>
> **Discussion:** The announcement sparked a mixed but detailed conversation, focusing on business strategy, pricing, and user choice. A central point of debate was Apple's move toward a subscription model, with some users expressing frustration at the industry-wide shift away from perpetual licenses, fearing it will lead to ongoing costs and forced updates. However, many commenters quickly clarified that Apple is offering both a subscription and the traditional one-time purchase option, which was seen as a more user-friendly approach than competitors like Adobe.

The pricing was a major topic, with many finding the $129/year subscription surprisingly reasonable, especially when compared to Adobe's Creative Cloud. The steep educational discount ($29.99/year) was highlighted as an excellent value. Strategically, users saw this as a direct challenge to Adobe's dominance in the creative space, though some noted it was less of a direct competitor to Microsoft Office.

Other key themes included skepticism about the value for users who only need one or two of the apps, leading to a discussion on the importance of the continued availability of individual purchases. There was also some disappointment that the bundle did not include other apps like the newly acquired Pixelmator (Photomator) or a full version of Xcode for iPadOS. Finally, a few users lamented the perceived lack of significant updates for Apple's professional desktop apps in recent years, questioning the long-term commitment to the pro market.

## [Fabrice Bellard's TS Zip (2024)](https://www.bellard.org/ts_zip/)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46593802

> **Article:** The article links to a new utility by renowned programmer Fabrice Bellard called "ts_zip". The tool demonstrates text compression using a Large Language Model (LLM). The core technique involves using an LLM to predict the probability distribution of the next token in a text. These probabilities are then fed into an arithmetic coder to generate a highly compressed bitstream. The decompressor uses the same model to reverse the process, reconstructing the original text losslessly. The page presents results on the Large Text Compression Benchmark, noting the tool's impressive performance, but also highlights the significant size of the required pre-trained model (150MB), which is a key point of contention in the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the technical validity and fairness of Bellard's LLM-based compression method, particularly in the context of standard benchmarks.

A central debate, initiated by user dmitrygr, questions the benchmark results by pointing out that the 150MB size of the LLM model is not included in the "compressed size" calculation. This leads to a broader conversation about what constitutes a "fair" comparison. Some users argue that this is a fundamentally different type of compression—"compression by understanding"—where the model acts like a pre-existing brain, making it an apples-to-oranges comparison with classical algorithms that start with zero knowledge.

The technical mechanics of how LLMs achieve lossless compression are also explained in detail. Users clarify that the process relies on arithmetic coding, which can encode data using fractional bits based on the LLM's probability predictions for the next token. A key point is that for this to work, the LLM's prediction process must be perfectly deterministic so that the encoder and decoder stay in sync.

Other notable points of discussion include:
*   A humorous anecdote about the legendary coding prowess of Bellard and Jeff Dean.
*   The application of this technique to steganography (hiding messages).
*   The philosophical connection between information theory (information as "surprise") and intelligence (the ability to predict).
*   A clarification on the benchmark results, showing that when the model size is factored in, ts_zip does not actually beat the top-performing programs that build their models from scratch as they process the data.

## [Text-based web browsers](https://cssence.com/2026/text-based-web-browsers/)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46597518

> **Article:** The article "Text-based web browsers" argues that text-based browsers like w3m are becoming increasingly obsolete and incompatible with the modern web. It posits that the web's inherent drive towards new, complex features (like advanced JavaScript and CSS) and the lack of developer incentive to support text-only modes create a widening gap. The author concludes that trying to force the modern web into a text-based experience is a futile effort, suggesting that the future of lightweight browsing lies not in adapting the web, but in using alternative protocols like Gemini.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's pessimistic conclusion but also showcases a dedicated, creative community working to preserve the text-based browsing experience. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **The Inevitability of Obsolescence:** Many commenters agree with the article's core premise. They argue that the web's trajectory towards complexity is unstoppable, citing examples like Google Search blocking text-based browsers like Lynx and modern Single-Page Applications (SPAs) rendering blank screens without JavaScript. The consensus is that the web "won't" support text-mode, even if it technically "can."

*   **The Practical Necessity and Niche Appeal:** A strong counter-argument highlights the critical use cases for text browsers. They are essential for system administrators working on headless servers, for developers troubleshooting graphical driver failures, and for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers. These are not just nostalgic tools but vital utilities for accessibility and remote work.

*   **Advanced and Modern Alternatives:** The discussion moves beyond classic browsers like Lynx and w3m. Commenters champion more modern and sophisticated projects:
    *   **Chawan:** Praised as a "real" browser with its own implementation of CSS and JavaScript, making it far more capable of handling modern sites than older tools.
    *   **edbrowse:** A unique CLI browser that integrates a mail client, SQL client, and IRC client, appealing to users who want a fully scriptable, line-oriented workflow.
    *   **Gemini Protocol:** Some advocate for abandoning the web for the Gemini protocol, which is designed from the ground up for lightweight, text-first content.

*   **Developer-Side Solutions:** There was a notable discussion on how web developers can improve the experience. Suggestions included structuring HTML with navigation at the bottom of the source order and using specific CSS media queries (like `@media: grid`) to detect and serve different styles to text-based browsers.

*   **Speculative AI Solutions:** One commenter brainstormed a futuristic approach: using a browser backend to render a page to a PDF, then using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract and present the core content as text, effectively using AI as a universal "lite mode" translator.

## [Show HN: AI in SolidWorks](https://www.trylad.com)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46591100

> **Project:** The project is "AI in SolidWorks," a tool that uses AI (specifically LLMs like Claude) to automate and assist with tasks in the SolidWorks CAD software. The creator, WillNickols, posted it on Hacker News to gauge interest. The core idea is to provide a natural language interface for CAD operations, allowing users to describe what they want to create or modify, and have the AI translate that into specific actions within the SolidWorks environment. The initial demo showed a coffee mug being created, and the project is presented as an exploration of whether current LLMs are capable enough for this task and if there's a market for such a tool.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of skepticism and excitement about using AI for CAD. The conversation centers on the current limitations and potential workarounds for making LLMs effectively perform precise spatial tasks.

Key points from the discussion include:

*   **Current Limitations and Flaws:** Several users noted that while promising, the technology is not yet perfect. The creator himself admitted that out-of-the-box models "aren't great at CAD" and that LLMs struggle significantly with spatial reasoning. A specific, recurring problem is their inability to correctly choose the right plane for sketching (e.g., for revolve or sweep features) without explicit guidance. One user pointed out that LLMs are "awful" at writing code for the SolidWorks API directly, with a 75% failure rate for generated scripts.

*   **Alternative Approaches and Architectures:** A user named `akiselev` shared their extensive experience with a similar project for Altium (PCB design software), highlighting a key architectural pattern. Instead of having the LLM perform actions directly, they use a multi-step process: one LLM (like Opus) generates high-level, natural language instructions, which are then translated by another LLM into a structured data format (like a JSON DSL) that can be executed. This approach seems to bypass some of the direct API failures.

*   **User Interface Debate:** There was a debate on whether text is the best interface for 3D modeling. While some argued that text is a poor medium for communicating spatial ideas, the creator noted that they hadn't found a clear alternative to chat. Others suggested that the problem is the ambiguity of colloquial language versus precise CAD terminology.

*   **Broader Context and Future:** The discussion touched on the nature of CAD software (which hasn't changed much in 15 years) and whether a specialized model, rather than a general-purpose LLM, would be a better long-term solution. The concept of a "PCB Design Copilot" was mentioned, with the caveat that a lack of public design datasets makes training such a model difficult. The idea of using visual aids like SVGs to help the LLM understand spatial layout was also proposed.

## [Local Journalism Is How Democracy Shows Up Close to Home](https://buckscountybeacon.com/2026/01/opinion-local-journalism-is-how-democracy-shows-up-close-to-home/)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46600850

> **Article:** The article argues that local journalism is the essential fabric of democracy at the community level. It posits that local reporters and outlets are uniquely accountable to their neighbors, covering the granular, civic issues—like school boards, zoning, and infrastructure—that directly impact residents' daily lives. The piece frames the decline of local news due to media consolidation and the loss of advertising revenue not just as a business failure, but as a direct threat to democratic engagement and oversight.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, treating the decline of local journalism as a critical democratic problem, but offers a range of diagnoses and potential solutions. A central theme is the economic unsustainability of local news. Several commenters point out that the internet destroyed the classified ad revenue that once subsidized local reporting, and that the remaining product often isn't considered valuable enough by a large enough audience to support it through subscriptions.

The conversation identifies two main culprits for the decline: media consolidation and tech platforms. Users note that large conglomerates have no local accountability and will shutter papers for profit, while others cite the rise of centralized property sites like Rightmove in the UK, which decimated a key advertising pillar for local papers. This has led to a perceived drop in quality, with some users arguing that surviving local outlets often produce "puff pieces" and lack the resources for hard-hitting investigative work, making them dependent on those in power.

Proposed solutions are varied and contentious. A prominent idea is public funding for journalism, with one user sketching out a model where a small percentage of municipal budgets could fund a local journalist or non-profit. However, this is met with skepticism about how to ensure independence from the government entities being covered. Other solutions discussed include a shift to non-profit or co-operative models, lean operations funded by individual patrons (akin to Patreon for indie games), and the importance of individual action, such as subscribing to local papers or directly engaging with local officials to effect change.

## [Iran has now been offline for 96 hours](https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/2010750871274160361)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46591974

> **Article:** The article, a tweet from the internet monitoring group NetBlocks, reports that Iran has been offline for 96 hours, indicating a widespread government-ordered internet shutdown. This action is a response to massive, ongoing anti-regime protests across the country. The shutdown is an attempt to stifle communication among protestors and prevent the flow of information about the crackdown to the outside world.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, expressing a mixture of hope for the protestors, analysis of the technological and political dynamics, and moral reflections on the situation.

There is a strong sense of empathy for the Iranian people, with many commenters describing the situation as "depressing" and a "nightmare." The conversation explores the effectiveness of the government's internet blackout and potential countermeasures. Users discuss the use of Starlink satellite internet as a way to bypass the shutdown, but it's noted that the regime appears to be jamming both the Starlink signals and the GPS required for the dishes to function. Practical methods for the regime to counter this, such as using drones to locate and seize the dishes, are also considered.

The discussion also delves into the political motivations behind the uprising. One prominent viewpoint argues that the protests are a genuine, grassroots movement born from long-standing oppression. A counter-narrative, however, posits that Western governments, particularly the US and Israel, are orchestrating the regime change to install a more favorable government in the region, with one user citing Glenn Greenwald to support this claim. This debate highlights skepticism about the true drivers of the conflict.

Finally, there are more visceral and philosophical comments. One user excitedly anticipates a "huge content drop" of videos and images once the internet is restored, which another user sharply criticizes as a profound moral failing. Others express a grim wish for the protestors' success and note the irony of the situation unfolding while the United States faces its own political turmoil.

## [U.S. Emissions Jumped in 2025 as Coal Power Rebounded](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/climate/us-emissions-2025-coal-power.html)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 172 | **ID:** 46599079

> **Article:** The New York Times article reports that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2025, reversing a multi-year trend of decline. The primary driver for this jump was a rebound in coal-fired power generation. The article likely explores the reasons behind this resurgence, such as economic factors, energy market dynamics, or policy shifts, and frames it as a setback for the nation's climate goals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a multifaceted debate covering environmental ethics, geopolitics, and economic arguments.

A significant portion of the conversation revolves around international comparisons and responsibility. Users debate China's emissions trajectory, with one user arguing that China's emissions are flat or falling, while another contends that China's historical emissions and role as the "world's factory" give it a different context. The "two wrongs don't make a right" sentiment is used to counter the idea that U.S. emissions are acceptable if other nations are also polluting.

Several comments touch on the ethical and emotional dimensions of climate change. One user expresses a sense of despair, shifting their worry from climate to the potential for global conflict and civilizational collapse. Another makes a passionate plea to appreciate nature over technological advancements like AI, arguing that the perceived economic benefits are not worth the environmental cost.

Economic and energy policy arguments are also prominent. One user posits that the U.S. prioritizes cheap, dependable energy for its economy, which is challenged by others who point out that coal is heavily subsidized and that cheaper, non-renewable alternatives like natural gas exist. The declining employment in the coal industry is noted, with a user observing that the political power of the industry may be waning as it becomes more automated and less of a major employer. A more pragmatic approach is suggested by one commenter, who argues for retrofitting existing coal plants for other uses rather than immediate demolition, though this is met with skepticism about the source of such claims.

> **Article:** The article reports the death of Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip. The linked content is a YouTube video, likely a news report or tribute. Comments on Hacker News provide context, noting that Adams died of prostate cancer at age 68. They cite Wikipedia entries detailing his rapid health decline in late 2025, including paralysis and heart failure, leading to his entry into hospice care in January 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of mourning, appreciation for his work, and reflection on his controversial legacy. While many commenters expressed sadness and paid tribute to his creative genius, the conversation frequently returned to the tension between his professional success and his later public persona.

Key themes included:
*   **Appreciation for Dilbert's Insight:** Many users, even those who disliked his politics, credited "The Dilbert Principle" and the comic strip with providing brilliant, timeless wisdom and humor about corporate life. Several mentioned it was essential reading for understanding management and office culture.
*   **The Overshadowing of His Politics:** A recurring sentiment was that Adams's later political commentary and controversial statements ultimately eclipsed his creative legacy. Commenters expressed a desire to remember him primarily as Dilbert's creator, acknowledging that his political opinions had become a dominant and divisive part of his public identity.
*   **Reflection on Fame and Legacy:** One commenter noted the ephemeral nature of fame, observing that Adams's primary medium (print cartoons) is now largely obsolete. This led to a broader reflection on how cultural icons can fade from relevance for younger generations and how quickly life moves on after a person's passing.
*   **Personal Health and Mortality:** The details of Adams's rapid decline from cancer prompted a few comments on the disease and the nature of aging. One user shared a personal anecdote about the challenges of dealing with a lifetime of "collections" after a person's death.

## [The UK is shaping a future of Precrime and dissent management](https://freedomnews.org.uk/2025/04/11/how-the-uk-is-shaping-a-future-of-precrime-and-dissent-management/)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46600194

> **Article:** The article from Freedom News argues that the UK government is developing a framework for "precrime" and dissent management. This is being achieved through a convergence of several policies, including predictive policing, new restrictions on protests, and the use of administrative punishments. The author contends that these measures, often justified under the guise of "risk management," collectively normalize the state's ability to act on suspicion rather than on proven criminal acts. This shift quietly lowers the threshold for what is considered dissent and expands state power to suppress it preemptively.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical and alarmed, with commenters drawing parallels to dystopian science fiction. The most common theme is the comparison of the article's subject matter to fictional works like *Black Mirror*, *Minority Report*, and George Orwell's *1984*, with many noting that fiction is becoming reality.

Several distinct points were raised:
*   **Dystopian Parallels:** Multiple users referenced sci-fi, particularly *Black Mirror* as a "leading indicator" and *Minority Report* as a direct analogy for pre-crime, while another invoked Orwellian concepts like "doubleplusgood."
*   **Government Motivation:** One commenter argued that such measures are a tactic for a government that is "unpopular" and cannot win open debate, forcing it to rely on control and enforcement. Another user countered that this is a long-standing trend, not specific to the current government.
*   **The "Who Watches the Watchers" Problem:** A thread explored the question of oversight, suggesting that corporations (Google, Meta, TikTok) are the new "watchers" and are deeply intertwined with governmental entities.
*   **Debate on Pre-emptive Action:** A user questioned whether pre-crime could work, which sparked a debate on the difference between punishing conspiracy (which is broadly accepted) and punishing predicted intent based on data analysis.
*   **The Slippery Slope:** A key point made was to consider not how the current government might use such a framework, but how a "future much worse government could use it for."

## [FOSS in times of war, scarcity and (adversarial) AI [video]](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FE7ULY-foss-in-times-of-war-scarcity-and-ai/)
**Score:** 117 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46598991

> **Article:** This is a scheduled FOSDEM 2026 talk titled "FOSS in times of war, scarcity and (adversarial) AI" by Michiel Leenaars. The talk's abstract argues that the foundational principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are being challenged by the current geopolitical climate. It posits that the "innocence" of the early internet is gone, replaced by state-sponsored adversarial actions and AI that lacks inherent ethics. The speaker suggests that FOSS, by its nature, can be weaponized by bad actors, and that the community must evolve beyond "blind trust." The proposed solution involves building more resilient systems, potentially through formal proofs, compartmentalization, and new social structures for establishing trust, moving towards a "zero-trust" model even within open communities.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the core tension between FOSS's open nature and the need to prevent its misuse in a hostile world. A central debate emerged around the ethics of "misuse." One commenter argued that FOSS is a "gift to humanity" that should be given freely, without expectation or obligation, and that it's hypocritical to try to control its use after the fact. This was countered by others who felt that if a tool is being "weaponised against us," it's a problem that must be addressed, invoking the "paradox of tolerance" to argue that unlimited tolerance can lead to its own destruction.

Several participants expressed skepticism about the feasibility of "legislating good use" through licenses, with one user pointing out that AI code generators could simply replicate the logic of a FOSS project with newly generated code, thereby circumventing license restrictions entirely. Instead of legal or technical restrictions, some advocated for architectural solutions, such as building systems with privacy and censorship-resistance by default, or reviving social structures like "chains of trust" to manage verification rather than abandoning trust altogether.

A few comments provided context or challenged the premise. One user noted the speaker's affiliation with an EU-funded program, questioning the talk's framing in light of the EU's own massive funding. Another commenter challenged the talk's assertion that AI is unethical or untruthful, arguing that AI is, on average, more truthful and ethical than humans, which prompted a request for downvoters to explain their reasoning. Finally, one user simply lamented the absence of a summary from the satirical "n-gate" blog.

## [Why Stoicism is one of the best mind hacks ever devised](https://aeon.co/essays/why-stoicism-is-one-of-the-best-mind-hacks-ever-devised)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46601121

> **Article:** The article argues that Stoicism is a powerful "mind hack" for modern life, not by suppressing emotion, but by providing a rational framework to manage it. The core principle is the "dichotomy of control": distinguishing between what we can influence (our judgments, choices, and actions) and what we cannot (external events, others' opinions). By focusing our energy exclusively on the former, we can achieve a state of tranquility and resilience, or "eudaimonia." The author posits that this practice, akin to modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), allows us to interpret events objectively and choose our response, making Stoicism an invaluable tool for navigating adversity and reducing anxiety.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted and often critical view of Stoicism, focusing on its modern application and potential pitfalls. A central theme is the danger of misinterpreting Stoicism as emotional suppression rather than emotional management. One highly upvoted comment warns against becoming a "dissociated" stoic who runs an "emotional debt," arguing that it's crucial to later process the emotions that were set aside in a crisis. This sparked a sub-thread on how one might practically "go back and feel" suppressed emotions, with users debating the feasibility of intentionally revisiting past panic.

This concern is echoed by users who worry that "pop stoicism" is being co-opted by online "manosphere" types to repackage unhealthy masculine traits like "sucking it up" and bottling feelings. There's a palpable fear that the philosophy is being used to formalize asocial or emotionally stunted behaviors.

Further critiques challenge the philosophy's core tenets. One user argues that true Stoicism, as exemplified by a dark quote from Epictetus about treating the death of a loved one with the same indifference as a broken cup, is an unrealistic and potentially unhealthy ideal. Another user contends that Stoicism "lobotomizes" potential by teaching indifference to outcomes, thereby stifling the drive to achieve one's values, though this is countered by a defense of Stoicism's focus on commitment to one's actions, not outcomes.

Amidst the criticism, several users offered clarifications and alternative perspectives. The distinction between "I am angry" and "I feel anger arising" was highlighted as a key Stoic practice for detaching from emotions. A popular comment reframed Stoicism through the lens of modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), suggesting Marcus Aurelius's writings are akin to "therapy homework" for challenging one's interpretations. Finally, some users connected Stoic ideas to other concepts, such as the "gray rock" tactic for dealing with conflict and Mel Robbins' "Let Them Theory," while others pointed to Eastern philosophies like Samkhya as offering a more comprehensive model.

## [Show HN: Yolobox – Run AI coding agents with full sudo without nuking home dir](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46592344

> **Project:** Yolobox is a command-line tool that creates a Docker container for running AI coding agents (like Claude, Codex) with full `sudo` privileges. The goal is to provide these powerful agents with the freedom to install dependencies and modify system configurations without risking damage to the user's host machine or home directory. It comes pre-configured with popular agent CLIs and mounts the current directory for read-write access, prioritizing a "vibe coding" workflow where safety is balanced with maximum agent capability.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with users appreciating the focus on containing the unpredictable side effects of AI agents. The discussion highlighted a spectrum of safety philosophies: while Yolobox grants full `sudo` access within the container for maximum utility, other projects like `Shai` and `ctenv` were mentioned for taking a more restrictive, security-first approach by limiting network access and file permissions.

Several technical alternatives and considerations were raised:
*   **Platform-specific tools:** Users pointed to Apple's native container framework and Linux's `Bubblewrap` as potentially lighter-weight alternatives to Docker.
*   **Permissions:** One user questioned if a simple non-admin user account would suffice, but the creator and others countered that agents often need elevated privileges to perform useful tasks like installing packages.
*   **Security:** A key point was the shared kernel risk with Docker; `rootless Podman` was suggested as a way to further isolate the environment.
*   **Integration:** A practical question arose about networking with other containers, with `host.docker.internal` suggested as a solution.

Overall, the project was seen as a solid, opinionated solution for developers who want to give their agents significant power while maintaining a clear boundary from their host system.
