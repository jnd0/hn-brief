# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-26

## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 988 | **Comments:** 607 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This system aggregates data from various government sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicaid. The report, based on court testimony and 404 Media coverage, suggests that this tool allows ICE to cross-reference datasets to identify and track individuals, raising significant privacy and civil liberties concerns regarding the use of health data for immigration enforcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the surveillance infrastructure, focusing on the dangers of data aggregation and the potential for abuse. Key themes include:

*   **The Fallacy of "Nothing to Hide":** Several users argued that privacy is essential not just for hiding wrongdoing, but as a protection against systemic errors and abuse of power. Commenters noted that even without malicious intent, bad data or algorithmic "hallucinations" could lead to dangerous consequences, such as wrongful raids.
*   **Infrastructure and Entrenchment:** There is a pessimistic view regarding the reversibility of these systems. Users expressed concern that once built, surveillance tools inevitably find broader applications and that they are designed to consolidate power, making it difficult for reformist leaders to dismantle them.
*   **Data Logic and Eligibility:** A sub-thread debated the technical feasibility of using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. While some questioned why Medicaid would hold data on undocumented immigrants, others clarified that Emergency Medicaid and state-level programs often do cover non-citizens, providing a vector for data collection.
*   **Federalism and Privacy:** One commenter argued that the centralization of data at the federal level—violating the principle of the 10th Amendment (states' rights)—creates a single point of failure and a "One True Database" that is inherently dangerous. They suggested that decentralized, state-level social services would offer better privacy protection through compartmentalization.
*   **Moral Responsibility:** A final sentiment targeted those who build these technologies, with users urging engineers to quit or "soft quit" (sabotage productivity) to resist contributing to the surveillance state.

## [A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 644 | **Comments:** 334 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The article, posted on the statistical modeling blog "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science," critiques a highly influential paper in management science that has been cited over 6,000 times. The author argues that despite its widespread citation, the paper is fundamentally flawed. The post highlights the broader issue of the academic incentive structure, where citation counts are often used as a proxy for quality and impact, leading to a "bandwagon effect" where researchers cite papers without critically evaluating or attempting to replicate their findings. The author suggests that the academic community should stop treating single studies as definitive proof and instead demand replication and robust evidence before building upon them.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes and systemic critiques of academic research. A central theme is the difficulty and career risk associated with challenging flawed or fraudulent work. Several users shared stories of failed replication attempts, including one where a family member discovered faked data in a biotech lab and had to switch research subjects to protect their career. Another commenter noted that their daughter's attempt to reproduce a well-cited paper was stonewalled by university administrators who feared political fallout from retracting a paper co-authored by a tenured peer reviewer. This points to a pervasive "don't rock the boat" culture, where junior researchers face career suicide for exposing misconduct by senior figures.

Commenters also discussed the systemic issues that allow flawed papers to accumulate citations. One user observed that researchers often cite papers they haven't read, simply copying citation lists, which inflates the count of low-quality work. Another proposed a "trust network" overlay for the citation graph to identify "tainted" papers and authors, though others were skeptical that such a system could avoid being gamed. The discussion also touched on the difference between retractions (for misconduct) and corrections (for errors), with some arguing that flawed papers should remain accessible with corrections to preserve the scientific record, rather than being retracted.

Finally, the conversation explored practical workarounds and the nature of scientific progress. One commenter suggested that instead of directly trying to replicate a flawed study (which is politically difficult and often unpublishable), a more effective strategy is to conduct "contrarian research" that produces a novel, contradictory result. Others emphasized that single studies, no matter how prestigious, should never be treated as definitive, and that true scientific consensus is built through partial replications and the cumulative work of the broader research community.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 581 | **Comments:** 285 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The article on netzbremse.de alleges that Deutsche Telekom (DT), Germany's largest ISP, is intentionally throttling the internet by under-dimensioning its network transit access points. The core accusation is that DT forces content providers to pay for direct, expensive contracts to reach DT customers at decent speeds, effectively creating a "fast lane" for paying partners while degrading performance for others. This practice is presented as a violation of net neutrality principles, where DT leverages its market dominance to extract fees rather than providing a neutral transit service.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply frustrated with Deutsche Telekom's infrastructure and business practices, with several key themes emerging.

A central point is the confirmation of DT's poor peering policies. Multiple users corroborate the article's claims, citing specific issues like DT's refusal to maintain adequate peering with Cloudflare, leading to severe latency and timeouts for German users accessing Cloudflare-protected sites, especially during peak hours. This is described as a deliberate strategy to force other networks to become paying customers rather than peers.

The conversation frequently touches on DT's de facto monopoly in many German regions. Users express frustration that there is often no alternative ISP, leading to a lack of competitive pressure to improve service quality. This is contrasted with Switzerland's open-access infrastructure model, which is held up as a better alternative. The lack of competition is a major source of user dissatisfaction.

Broader criticisms of Germany's digital infrastructure and societal contradictions are also prominent. Commenters lament the country's slow DSL rollout, the unreliability of services (e.g., lines failing in the rain), and a general bureaucratic inertia that hinders progress. This is framed as part of a larger pattern where Germany, despite being a major economy, struggles with modern technology, drawing comparisons to its troubled railway system and contradictory attitudes towards privacy and technology.

Finally, users share personal workarounds and solutions. Some have switched to alternative providers like Vodafone where available, while others have turned to satellite internet via Starlink to escape DT's service quality, despite personal reservations about the provider. The discussion also highlights the negative impact on developers and businesses, with some noting that German users are not a significant market for them due to these infrastructure issues.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 506 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source macOS application called "Posturr" that uses the webcam to monitor a user's posture. If the app detects that the user is slouching (specifically, if their head drops below a certain baseline height), it blurs the screen to provide a visual cue to sit up straighter. The project is a single Swift file and is available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on several key themes: privacy and security concerns, the technical implementation, and the practicality of posture correction.

A primary concern for many users was privacy, with commenters expressing hesitation to run an unaudited, open-source application that accesses the camera. However, others countered that the codebase is small enough (under 1000 lines) to be easily reviewed by the user or an AI tool, making it a low-risk proposition.

Technically, the author clarified a confusing reference to "Claude Mode" in the code, explaining it was an experimental and abandoned attempt to use an AI model (Claude) to assess slouching, which proved too slow and inaccurate compared to the current, simpler method of tracking head height. Some users suggested leveraging the open-source machine learning ecosystem for more advanced posture detection, though the author's current approach was deemed effective enough.

Finally, the discussion touched on the practicality of the app. Some users debated whether good posture is even possible with a laptop without an external monitor, while others shared their own ergonomic setups or humorous workarounds. The app was generally received as a clever concept, with several users expressing a willingness to pay for a more polished, notarized version.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 407 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the primary job of a writer is to earn the reader's attention immediately. It posits that before you can inform or persuade, you must first create a reason for the reader to invest their time. The piece likely explores techniques for creating compelling hooks, establishing stakes, and framing information in a way that resonates emotionally or intellectually from the very first sentence, rather than burying the lede or saving the "so what" for later.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis but complicates its application, focusing on the tension between engagement and integrity. A primary theme is the conflict between audience needs: technical readers often prefer to "just start with the interesting part first" and get straight to the details, while a general audience requires a narrative hook to become invested. Several commenters argue that the "make me care" approach is often a manipulative tactic to drive page impressions, advocating instead for a "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) philosophy that respects the reader's time by stating the point immediately.

The conversation also extends the principle to modern media, with one user analyzing TikTok as a "brute-force attack on human psychology" where creators have seconds to hook viewers, leading to an evolutionary arms race of attention-grabbing techniques. This sparked a counterpoint about the value of forced patience, with a commenter noting that they use platforms like SiriusXM specifically because the inability to skip songs has led them to discover music they would have otherwise dismissed. The discussion concludes with a debate on the nature of storytelling, with some users asserting that all good fiction is essentially a mystery to be solved, while others express a preference for stories that evoke feeling or explore ideas directly, finding mystery-based narratives to be intentionally obscure.

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 393 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article, titled "Yes, It's Fascism," argues that the actions of the Trump administration, particularly regarding the use of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), align with the definition of fascism. It points to the administration's deployment of state-sanctioned violence, the creation of an enforcement agency that operates with impunity, and the immediate justification of lethal force by labeling victims as "terrorists" without due process. The piece suggests that these actions are not isolated incidents but part of a systemic shift toward authoritarianism, supported by a loyal base and a complicit political apparatus.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly in agreement with the article's premise, with commenters expressing alarm and drawing direct parallels between current events and historical fascist regimes, specifically 1930s Germany. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **ICE as a Fascist Instrument:** Commenters frequently compare ICE to the Nazi "brown shirts" or "jackboots," arguing that the agency's recruitment process, high pay, and lack of accountability self-select for individuals willing to use excessive force. There is a shared belief that ICE is operating as a paramilitary force with impunity, particularly in Democratic-leaning states.
*   **Systemic Intent vs. Incompetence:** A debate emerges on whether the violence is a result of deliberate, systemic fascist intent or simply poorly trained agents given too much freedom. Most commenters lean toward the former, pointing to the administration's immediate rhetoric justifying the killings as evidence of a top-down strategy to normalize state violence.
*   **The "Boy Who Cried Wolf" Counter-Argument:** One user expresses "semantic satiation," noting that the term "fascism" has been used so frequently over the last decade that it has lost its impact, even if the current situation warrants the label. Other users rebut this by arguing that the warnings were accurate all along and are now coming to fruition.
*   **Political Paralysis and Future Outlook:** There is significant pessimism regarding the future. Users fear that the Republican party will not moderate after Trump and that the Democratic party is failing to propose meaningful structural reforms (e.g., abolishing or trying ICE) instead opting for superficial solutions like "more training." The consensus is that the current trajectory is unlikely to reverse, with fears that elections may be compromised or that the damage to democratic norms is already permanent.
*   **Historical Context:** Users referenced Umberto Eco’s essay on "Ur-fascism" and a historian's blog post analyzing 1933 Germany to substantiate their claims, framing the current moment within a broader historical pattern of authoritarian rise.

## [Oneplus phone update introduces hardware anti-rollback](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 368 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** The article reports that OnePlus has introduced a hardware-based anti-rollback mechanism in a recent software update for its phones. This mechanism uses "eFuses" (electronic fuses) within the phone's processor. When a user updates to a new firmware version, a physical fuse is permanently blown. If the user later attempts to downgrade to an older firmware version, the bootloader will detect that the fuse's recorded version is higher than the firmware's version and will refuse to boot. This effectively prevents users from installing older versions of the operating system, including custom ROMs that are built against older firmware components.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the motivations, technical details, and broader implications of OnePlus's anti-rollback implementation.

A central theme is the debate over the reasons behind this move. Several users speculate that it's a security measure to patch a vulnerability that allowed attackers to bypass theft-locking mechanisms by downgrading to an exploitable firmware version. This aligns with industry trends, as similar anti-rollback features exist in iPhones and Samsung's Knox. However, many commenters are cynical, viewing it as a way for OnePlus to lock users into their ecosystem, kill the vibrant custom ROM community, and force adoption of potentially inferior future updates, thereby encouraging new device purchases.

Technically, the discussion clarifies how the mechanism works. It's not just a software check; the primary bootloader, stored in the processor's read-only memory (ROM), reads a version number from the permanently blown eFuse. It then compares this to the version embedded in the secondary bootloader (XBL) before loading it. This makes the check hardware-enforced and difficult to bypass. The conversation also touches on how this integrates with Android's existing Verified Boot system, which protects the kernel and system partitions, creating a multi-layered defense against software rollbacks.

Finally, the conversation broadens to the philosophical question of ownership. Commenters argue that such manufacturer-controlled "kill switches" undermine the concept of truly owning a device you've purchased. This sentiment is extended to other products like modern cars, where software updates and remote "phone home" features also limit user control. The consensus is that while there may be legitimate security justifications, these features ultimately reduce user autonomy and reinforce the power of manufacturers over their hardware.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior local health officials in Iran estimate the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article cites the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which has confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating another 17,031. The report notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify the 30,000 figure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is polarized, with users debating the credibility of the death toll and the broader geopolitical context.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on skepticism regarding the source and potential motives behind the report. Several commenters draw parallels to the lead-up to the Iraq War, suggesting the figures could be "manufactured consent" for military intervention. They point to the article's own disclaimer that the numbers cannot be independently verified as a major red flag. This skepticism is contrasted by others who argue that the lack of on-the-ground reporting is a direct result of the Iranian government's severe internet shutdowns and suppression of information, making official silence a reason to take the reports more seriously, not less.

The discussion also branches into technical and historical topics. One user makes a detailed plea for the tech community to build "offline-first" applications and decentralized mesh networks, arguing that modern software is dangerously unprepared for state-level internet blackouts. This sparked a debate on whether such functionality should be a universal requirement or a niche feature. Elsewhere, users compared the 30,000 figure to historical events like the Dresden bombing, with others countering that such comparisons are unhelpful and that the nature of suppressing widespread protests differs significantly from aerial bombardments. Finally, some users questioned the sourcing of the 30,000 number, noting a discrepancy between the article's primary source and the title's attribution to "local health officials."

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The article reports that the White House altered an arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and ICE protester, to make it appear she was crying. The altered image was posted on the official White House X (formerly Twitter) account shortly after the original photo was shared by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The article frames this as a rapid and unapologetic use of generative AI for political propaganda, undermining public trust and contributing to a "post-truth" environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the White House's actions, viewing the incident as a dangerous escalation in the use of AI for political manipulation and a further erosion of democratic norms.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Erosion of Truth and Trust:** Many commenters expressed alarm that this incident exemplifies the "post-truth" political strategy, where the goal is not to present a factual narrative but to sow enough doubt that objective truth becomes irrelevant. This is seen as a deliberate tactic to bypass accountability.
*   **Weaponization of AI:** The event is frequently cited as a real-world example of how generative AI will be used for propaganda, disinformation, and political attacks. Commenters noted how quickly this technology has been adopted for such purposes, moving from theoretical concern to reality.
*   **Political Polarization and Base Support:** A recurring point is that the action, while damaging to institutional credibility, will not alienate the administration's core supporters. Some argued that this base is willing to overlook or even celebrate such actions, reinforcing a deep political divide.
*   **Legal and Social Consequences:** There was speculation about potential legal repercussions, such as a libel or defamation lawsuit from the individual in the photo. However, others were pessimistic, suggesting the Supreme Court might grant immunity or that a fair trial would be impossible. The incident also sparked broader despair about the state of US democracy and social cohesion.
*   **Skepticism of Online Discourse:** One commenter astutely pointed out the irony of judging public perception from online comments in an era of AI-driven fakery, highlighting the difficulty of discerning genuine sentiment from manufactured noise.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 269 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article, authored by MP Zarah Sultana, argues that Palantir, a US-based data analytics and surveillance technology company, should be excluded from UK public services, particularly the Ministry of Defence. The piece highlights Palantir's controversial origins, its deep ties to US intelligence agencies (including the CIA and NSA), and its work with authoritarian regimes. It expresses concern over the company's growing influence in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) and other public bodies, warning that this reliance on a foreign private corporation threatens national sovereignty, data privacy, and democratic oversight. The author calls for a public debate and a halt to contracts with Palantir, advocating for public investment in open-source, publicly-owned alternatives instead.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with commenters expanding the scope of the original article's concerns. A dominant theme is the broader issue of mass surveillance and the erosion of privacy in the UK. Several users argue that Palantir is merely a symptom of a deeper, systemic problem, suggesting the UK is already a "surveillance state" and that replacing one vendor with another does little to change the underlying trajectory. This sentiment is extended to other major US tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, with some commenters asserting that all are equally dangerous and that true change would require a complete divestment from critical foreign technology infrastructure.

Another significant thread focuses on the political and ideological nature of Palantir. The company's CEO, Alex Karp, is described as a "philosopher" with an ideological mission, leading to fears that the company's tools could be used to undermine democracy. This is contrasted with a more cynical view from one commenter who argues that Palantir is simply fulfilling a demand from governments for powerful surveillance and data-analysis tools, and that calls to reject it are naive.

The discussion also takes a sharp turn into ad hominem attacks and political polarization. The credibility of the article's author, Zarah Sultana, is challenged by one user who labels her a "racist conspiracy theorist," linking to an article about her attendance at a pro-Palestinian rally. This sparked a brief sub-thread about media bias and propaganda. The conversation is further colored by a sense of political pessimism, with users expressing hopelessness about the effectiveness of protests (which one claims are "illegal now") and the ability of elected officials to represent the public interest over "monied interests." Ultimately, the debate reflects a deep-seated anxiety about the intersection of big tech, government power, and individual liberty.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 191 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted a nationwide policy creating no-fly zones for drones around Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy (DOE) operations, including mobile assets like ICE convoys. Unlike standard Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), these zones do not provide specific geographic coordinates or activation times in public NOTAMs. Instead, the restricted airspace—a 3,000-foot lateral and 1,000-foot vertical bubble—moves with the federal assets. This means drone operators could unknowingly violate airspace restrictions simply by flying near a passing convoy, potentially facing legal consequences for an infraction they could not reasonably anticipate.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the new policy, with commenters viewing it as a tool for government overreach and a hallmark of authoritarianism. The primary concerns revolve around the vagueness and mobility of the restrictions, which make it nearly impossible for a law-abiding drone operator to avoid violations. Many compared the situation to dystopian literature like *1984* or the concept of "Catch-22," arguing that the FAA is creating laws that are impossible not to break.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Enforceability and Legality:** Users questioned the constitutional validity of a "secret" no-fly zone that moves without public notification. Some suggested this would likely be struck down in court if challenged, similar to vague laws like "reasonable and prudent" speed limits.
*   **Surveillance and Privacy:** There was significant concern that this policy is designed to prevent the public from documenting government operations, particularly those of ICE. Commenters noted that the rule effectively weaponizes the law against drone operators who might record activities, either intentionally or accidentally.
*   **Technical Loopholes:** Discussion touched on the technical feasibility of avoiding detection. While some noted that modern drones emit registered IDs (DroneID), others pointed out that sub-250g drones or custom-built drones without geofencing can operate "under the radar."
*   **Ambiguity of "Mobile Assets":** The definition of what constitutes a restricted asset was criticized as too broad. One user noted that a rental car carrying Department of Energy personnel could technically be considered a "mobile asset," creating a moving no-fly zone that is indistinguishable from normal traffic.
*   **Potential for Escalation:** A few users speculated that this NOTAM might serve as legal cover for federal agents to jam or destroy drones that approach too closely, treating them as threats without needing to assess intent individually.

## [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world (2019)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46758450

> **Article:** The article discusses the "3.5% rule," a theory proposed by political scientist Erica Chenoweth suggesting that no government has withstood a challenge where 3.5% of the population actively participates in non-violent protests. The rule posits that this level of participation is sufficient to bring about significant political change, often by causing defections among elites and security forces. The article frames this as a hopeful statistic for activists, emphasizing the power of mass, non-violent civil resistance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion critically examines the "3.5% rule," with many commenters arguing that it is outdated or fails to account for modern political realities. The central theme is the rule's apparent failure in recent global events.

Several users point to specific counterexamples where large-scale protests did not achieve their goals. The protests in Israel and Iran are cited as instances where participation far exceeded 3.5% but failed to dislodge the ruling governments. Hong Kong is also mentioned as a case where the rule proved ineffective. Commenters suggest that modern authoritarian regimes have developed more sophisticated methods of repression, such as co-opting protests, using non-lethal but demoralizing force, and controlling the narrative through propaganda (e.g., dismissing protesters as "paid actors"), which makes the non-violent strategy less effective than in the past.

A significant point of debate is the role of violence in successful movements. One commenter argues that non-violence only works when there is a credible threat of violence from another faction, using the relationship between Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Panthers as an example. This view is countered by a more nuanced interpretation of Chenoweth's work, which clarifies that the 3.5% figure is a descriptive statistic from historical data, not a guaranteed formula for success. This interpretation emphasizes that success depends on building a broad public constituency and creating conditions for elite defection, rather than simply hitting a numerical target.

Finally, the discussion broadens to question the very premise of collective action. One commenter notes that the rule is meaningless if there are multiple, opposing groups each with over 3.5% support. Another shifts the focus to the power of individuals, citing assassins and influential entrepreneurs as examples of single actors who can change the world, though this is debated with the counter-argument that such individual power is an illusion and real change stems from collective will.

**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 17 | **ID:** 46753708

> **Article:** The article links to "DPaint-js," a web-based image editor created by Steffest that is modeled after the classic Amiga software Deluxe Paint. The project is implemented in vanilla JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub. It aims to replicate the nostalgic feel and functionality of the original application for modern web browsers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the project, with commenters praising the clean, readable, and well-structured vanilla JavaScript code. Many appreciated its departure from complex modern frameworks, viewing it as a refreshing and well-executed nostalgic tool.

The discussion highlighted several key aspects:
*   **Creator's Background:** Users noted that the author is a talented graphic artist and demoscener, and that DPaint-js is used to create entries for competitions like GERP 2026, with links shared to impressive demo videos.
*   **Feature Comparison & Critiques:** While most were enthusiastic, some users compared it to the original Deluxe Paint. A key critique was that the core "custom brush" feature—where selecting pixels immediately turns them into a drawable brush—was missing in the main version. However, it was clarified that this feature is present in the development version. Another user pointed out the absence of a "Perspective" tool and noted the dark theme was a departure from the original's light theme.
*   **Technical Feedback:** A specific bug was reported regarding the smudge tool's blending behavior, which varied across browsers. The author acknowledged the issue and responded directly in the thread, stating he had pushed an update to improve it.
*   **Alternatives:** The existence of PyDPainter, a Python-based Deluxe Paint clone for desktop, was also mentioned as a relevant alternative.

## [Over 36,500 killed in Iran's deadliest massacre, documents reveal](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198)
**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46760329

> **Article:** The article from Iran International reports on a newly revealed document detailing a massacre in Iran, allegedly killing over 36,500 people in just two days across 400 cities. The event is described as the regime's response to widespread protests, with the article claiming that many victims were executed after being arrested or hospitalized. The piece suggests the scale of the violence far exceeds initial estimates and highlights the regime's use of external mercenaries to carry out the killings.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, focusing on the scale of the violence, the reliability of the source, and the geopolitical implications.

Many commenters expressed shock at the sheer number of casualties, with comparisons drawn to historical atrocities and other modern massacres, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, to contextualize the high death toll. Users debated the logistics of how such a high number of deaths could be achieved in a short timeframe, with some suggesting it involved systematic executions of those already in custody rather than just battlefield violence.

A significant portion of the debate centered on the credibility of the source, Iran International. Several users noted the outlet's funding links to Saudi Arabia and potential biases, with one commenter labeling it a "state aligned influence media" outlet. This skepticism was further highlighted by a quote from Mehdi Hasan, which criticized Western media for uncritically accepting high death tolls from Iran while questioning similar figures from Gaza.

The discussion also branched into political and geopolitical analysis. Users debated the effectiveness of sanctions and civilian pressure campaigns, questioning whether they inadvertently empower regimes to hire foreign mercenaries. The role of the U.S. and former President Trump was criticized by some for making promises of support that may have encouraged protesters without following through, potentially exacerbating the death toll. Finally, commenters discussed the nature of the Iranian regime, describing it as a totalitarian state and analyzing the internal ethnic dynamics that might facilitate such violence.

## [Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems](https://www.diljitpr.net/blog-post-postgresql-dlq)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 57 | **ID:** 46755115

> **Article:** The article describes a pattern for implementing a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in event-driven systems using PostgreSQL. It proposes a table-based approach where failed messages are stored. To process these failed messages, the article recommends using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` combined with `LIMIT`. This allows multiple worker processes to safely dequeue messages in parallel without locking the entire table, ensuring efficient and concurrent processing of dead-lettered events.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a split between practical acceptance and architectural skepticism regarding using PostgreSQL for queues.

**Practicality and Scale:**
Many commenters defend the approach for low-to-medium volume systems (e.g., under 100m events/day). They argue that the simplicity, SQL visibility, and ease of local development make Postgres an excellent default for most business applications. A specific example was cited where Segment successfully uses MySQL as a primary queue, suggesting that database-backed queues are viable at scale with proper engineering.

**Technical Nuances and Risks:**
Technical advice focused heavily on the `SKIP LOCKED` implementation. Commenters emphasized the importance of using `LIMIT` to prevent locking too many rows and the need to monitor query performance, as `ANALYZE` can lag on append-heavy tables, leading to poor execution plans. A significant risk highlighted was the lack of a circuit breaker: a spike in failures could overwhelm the DLQ table, causing database instability or message loss if the queue becomes unavailable.

**Architectural Skepticism:**
A minority of commenters criticized the pattern as using the "wrong data structure" for a queue, arguing that B-trees (Postgres' underlying storage) are inefficient for high-velocity insert/delete operations compared to specialized message brokers. They warned that while it works initially, scaling issues will eventually require a migration to a dedicated queue system.

**Tools and References:**
Users referenced existing open-source tools like `pgmq` that implement these patterns, as well as the use of `pg_cron` for cleanup tasks.

## [Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m77dmxlvlo)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46757162

> **Article:** A BBC article reports that a Spanish high-speed train derailment was caused by a fractured track. An official investigation found a "complete lack of continuity" in the rail at the site of the accident, which occurred in 2024. The report indicates that the fracture was present before the train derailed, and that several other trains had passed over the damaged section of track without incident prior to the disaster.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the causes of the accident, potential detection methods, and a comparative analysis of rail safety systems.

A primary theme was the failure of maintenance and monitoring systems. Commenters were shocked that such a significant track fracture could go undetected, especially since other trains had reportedly passed over it. This led to a detailed exploration of how track integrity is monitored. Users mentioned specialized measurement trains equipped with cameras and LIDAR (like the UK's "New Measurement Train" or Germany's "RAILab"), as well as manual inspections. There was a debate on whether all trains should be equipped with basic sensors for real-time anomaly detection. Some commenters also noted that the fracture might have occurred between an old and a newly replaced section of track, highlighting the challenges at transition points.

Another major point of discussion was the comparison between Spanish and Japanese high-speed rail safety. One user pointed out that despite Spain's extensive high-speed network, it has experienced multiple fatal derailments in recent decades, whereas Japan's Shinkansen has maintained a perfect safety record since the 1960s. This prompted speculation about differences in maintenance budgets, operational culture, and systemic safety approaches.

Finally, commenters debated the physics of derailments and potential mitigation strategies. While some suggested physical barriers between tracks, others argued this was impractical for high-speed trains due to the immense energy involved, which could worsen a crash by creating more debris. The consensus leaned towards prevention through robust track monitoring rather than attempting to contain derailments after they occur.

## [Jurassic Park - Tablet device on Nedry's desk? (2012)](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/jurassic-park-tablet-device-on-nedrys-desk.169883/)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46752261

> **Article:** The article is a 2012 forum thread from The RPF (The Replica Prop Forum) discussing a specific prop from the 1993 film *Jurassic Park*: a tablet-like device seen on the desk of the character Dennis Nedry. The discussion centers on identifying the prop and uncovering its real-world origins. The consensus is that the prop was not a futuristic concept but a real-world design mockup for a Motorola device (originally named iRadio, later Envoy), which was given to the film's production designer by the head of the frogdesign firm after a chance meeting with Steven Spielberg.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expanded significantly on the original article, treating the prop as a springboard to discuss the real-world technology featured in *Jurassic Park* and other sci-fi films. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

**1. The Real-World Tech of *Jurassic Park***
Multiple users highlighted that the film was grounded in real, cutting-edge technology of the early 1990s, rather than pure science fiction.
*   **The UNIX System:** One user noted that the 3D file system visualizer (FSV) used by Lex was a real tool, a clone of the SGI IRIX utility `fsn`. Another user, B1FIDO, confirmed this, explaining that Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations were the industry standard for graphics and were a natural choice for a film production.
*   **The Supercomputer:** The massive, black supercomputer with a wall of red LEDs was identified as a Thinking Machines Connection Machine CM-5, a real and iconic supercomputer from that era.
*   **The Circuit Breaker:** The manual prime-and-release circuit breaker that Dr. Sattler uses to restore power was also confirmed to be a real piece of equipment, with a user explaining the engineering reason for its design (preventing arc flash).

**2. Sci-Fi's History of Predicting the Future**
The conversation broadened to include other examples of sci-fi films featuring technology that preceded or accurately predicted real-world devices.
*   **2001: A Space Odyssey:** Users pointed out that the book (and film, which predates the moon landing) featured a handheld tablet-like device for reading news, which was remarkably prescient.
*   **Aliens:** A user highlighted the use of GRiD Compass laptops in the 1986 film, noting that these clamshell portables were real and available as early as 1982, making their inclusion plausible rather than futuristic.

**3. The Broader Legacy and Frustration with the Franchise**
While many celebrated the technical accuracy of the original film, this led to a critique of the subsequent *Jurassic Park* movies.
*   One user expressed a desire for a reboot that would hew closer to the original novel's horror elements and scientific depth, viewing the later films as a disrespectful decline into "bad sci-fi."
*   This sentiment was echoed by another commenter who found the 3D printer in *Jurassic Park III* more unbelievable than the dinosaurs themselves.

**4. Anecdotes and Meta-Commentary**
*   **Authenticity:** Users were impressed that the actual designer of the Motorola device (Hartmut Esslinger) participated in the original forum thread, providing a direct account of how the prop was sourced.
*   **Startup Theory:** A user humorously proposed a "Jurassic Park Theory of Startups," suggesting that the more easily a company's team can be mapped to the characters in the film, the more dysfunctional the company is.
