## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 1066 | **Comments:** 660 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This tool aggregates data from various federal sources, including the Department of Health and Human Services, to compile addresses and other information for targeting and enforcement actions. The report highlights concerns over the merging of health data with immigration enforcement infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the privacy implications of government data aggregation and the potential for abuse of power. A recurring theme is the danger of the "nothing to hide" argument, with users noting that data misuse can affect anyone, not just specific target groups. Several commenters expressed concern about the risks of bad data or algorithmic errors leading to wrongful enforcement actions, such as mistaken raids on innocent households.

There was significant debate regarding the specific link between Medicaid data and immigration enforcement. While some users questioned why Medicaid would hold data on undocumented immigrants, others clarified that emergency Medicaid services and state-level programs often do cover certain immigrant populations, providing a data trail for ICE to exploit. The discussion also touched on the political and ethical responsibilities of engineers working on such surveillance tools, with some suggesting "soft quitting" or data poisoning as forms of resistance. Finally, the conversation broadened to critique the expansion of the federal security apparatus, with some users arguing that decentralized, state-level social services would offer better protection against mass surveillance.

## [A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 660 | **Comments:** 337 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The article, posted on the statistical modeling blog "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science," critiques a highly influential paper in management science that has been cited over 6,000 times. The author, Andrew Gelman, argues that despite its massive citation count, the paper is fundamentally flawed. The post highlights the disconnect between citation metrics and actual scientific validity, suggesting that the academic incentive structure rewards novelty and high-profile publications over rigor and reproducibility. The core message is a warning against treating single, uncited studies as definitive evidence and a call for the scientific community to place greater value on replication efforts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with a strong consensus that flawed or non-replicable research is a widespread and systemic problem across many academic fields, not just management science. Commenters shared personal anecdotes of being unable to reproduce well-cited papers in biotech and sensor development, with some noting that pushing for retractions can be career-threatening, especially for junior researchers challenging senior figures. This points to a "don't rock the boat" culture that protects established but potentially erroneous work.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the systemic incentives that perpetuate this issue. Users argued that the academic system prioritizes novelty and citation counts over accuracy, making replication studies difficult to publish and often unrewarding. One commenter suggested a more "practical" approach might be to conduct "contrarian research" that produces a novel, opposing result, as this is more likely to be published than a direct replication attempt.

Several ideas for improving the scientific ecosystem were proposed. A user floated the concept of a "trust network" to overlay the citation graph, tagging papers and authors that uncritically cite flawed work to provide a more nuanced signal than raw citation numbers. However, others were skeptical, fearing that any such system would inevitably be gamed. The discussion also touched on the ethics of authorship, debating whether researchers who produce flawed work due to systemic pressures should be labeled as "bad people," with most commenters leaning towards critiquing the system rather than individual morality. The conversation concluded with a shared sentiment that the current academic environment is often hostile to those who try to correct the scientific record.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 585 | **Comments:** 286 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The linked article on netzbremse.de accuses Deutsche Telekom (DT), Germany's largest ISP, of intentionally throttling the internet by underdimensioning its network transit access points. The core allegation is that DT creates artificial bottlenecks to force external internet services to pay for direct, expensive contracts with them to ensure decent connection speeds for DT customers. This practice effectively penalizes services that do not have a direct paid agreement with the ISP, leading to slow loading times and poor performance for a significant portion of German internet users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's claims, with many users sharing personal experiences of poor performance from Deutsche Telekom, particularly when accessing sites hosted on services like Cloudflare. A central theme is DT's market dominance and alleged anti-competitive behavior. Users in certain areas have no alternative ISP, creating a de facto monopoly that allows DT to maintain subpar service without losing customers. The discussion contrasts Germany's situation with other countries like Switzerland, which have adopted open-access infrastructure models to foster competition.

Technical specifics are also debated. Some commenters point to DT's poor peering agreements, specifically its reluctance to maintain adequate connections at internet exchange points like DE-CIX, which forces traffic through inefficient, centralized routes. This is linked to a known issue with Cloudflare, where DT's customers experience extreme latency or complete service failures. The conversation broadens into a critique of German infrastructure and bureaucracy, with users drawing parallels to the decline of the railway system. As a practical workaround, some users have switched to alternatives like Starlink, citing better performance and reliability despite personal reservations about the provider. The overall sentiment is one of frustration with a powerful ISP that is perceived to be failing its customers and the broader internet ecosystem.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 538 | **Comments:** 178 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source macOS application called "Posturr" that monitors a user's posture using the webcam. If the app detects the user is slouching (based on head height), it blurs the screen to provide a visual cue to sit up straighter. The project is a single Swift file and is available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of interest in the concept and skepticism regarding its implementation and practicality. Several users expressed a willingness to pay for a polished, secure version of the app, emphasizing the need for security auditing and notarization given the camera access. However, others argued that the code is simple enough to be audited easily or reviewed by an AI.

A point of confusion was the mention of "Claude Mode" in the app's notification. The author clarified that this was an experimental feature where the app sent screenshots to an AI to assess slouching, but it was abandoned for being too slow and inaccurate; the current version uses simple head-height detection.

Technical discussions included:
*   **Privacy and Security:** The primary concern for many was the potential risk of an unaudited app having camera access.
*   **Detection Logic:** Users debated how the app distinguishes between slouching and natural variations in height (e.g., standing up or chair adjustments). The consensus was that the app likely establishes a baseline and updates it dynamically.
*   **Alternatives:** One user suggested using open-source pose estimation models from Hugging Face instead of the current stack.

The conversation also broadened to the general ergonomics of laptop use, with many agreeing that good posture is difficult to achieve with a laptop alone and requires an external monitor and a proper chair. Some users shared humorous or cynical takes, while others discussed related ideas, such as an app to detect when they aren't wearing their glasses.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 484 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the primary job of a writer is to earn the reader's attention immediately. It posits that before you can inform or persuade, you must first create a reason for the audience to invest their time. The piece likely explores techniques for creating compelling hooks, establishing relevance, and avoiding the common mistake of burying the lede. It frames the challenge of writing not just as conveying information, but as a battle against the reader's natural inclination to disengage, suggesting that narrative non-fiction and strong opening lines are essential tools for overcoming this inertia.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but complicates it by debating the ethics and practicalities of "hooking" an audience. A central tension emerged between two schools of thought: the "broadcast" approach, which prioritizes clarity and respects the reader's time by stating the point upfront (often cited as the military's "Bottom Line Up Front" or BLUF method), and the "attention-grabbing" approach, which uses narrative hooks to ensure the audience stays engaged long enough to receive the message.

Commenters explored the psychological impact of this dynamic, particularly in the context of modern media. Several users drew parallels to TikTok, describing it as a "brute-force attack on human psychology" that trains users to discard content that doesn't provide immediate gratification. This was contrasted with the value of patience; one user noted that forcing oneself to listen to full songs on SiriusXM (where skipping is harder) led to discovering tracks they would have otherwise missed, suggesting that the "make me care" imperative might be eroding our ability to appreciate slow-burn content.

There was also a critique of how this dynamic affects writers. Some argued that the pressure to create viral hooks forces authors to bury the actual substance of their work, leading to SEO-driven fluff rather than detailed, valuable content. The conversation concluded with a focus on audience awareness: while a hook is necessary, the most effective communication begins with understanding who you are speaking to and what they value, rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all gimmick.

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 409 | **Comments:** 202 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article from *The Atlantic* argues that the actions of the Trump administration, specifically regarding ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), constitute fascism. It draws direct parallels between current events and historical fascist regimes, citing the use of state-sanctioned violence, the lack of due process, and the administration's rhetoric in justifying lethal force against civilians. The piece contends that these are not isolated incidents but part of a systematic approach to authoritarian control, labeling the current political climate as a definitive shift toward fascist governance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly aligned with the article's premise, expressing deep concern and alarm over the current political trajectory of the United States. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **ICE as a Fascist Instrument:** Commenters frequently compare ICE to historical paramilitary forces like the Nazi Brownshirts, citing its perceived lack of accountability, alleged brutality, and the administration's swift defense of its violent actions. There is a strong sentiment that the agency is acting with impunity.
*   **Historical Parallels and Warnings:** Many users reference historical fascist regimes, particularly 1930s Germany, to contextualize their fears. Umberto Eco's essay on "Ur-fascism" is cited as a relevant framework for understanding the current situation. The discussion includes a debate on whether the term "fascism" has been overused to the point of desensitization, with some users arguing that past warnings are now being vindicated.
*   **Political and Social Division:** The conversation highlights a perceived deep divide in the country. Some commenters express shock at the level of support for aggressive immigration enforcement, noting that many Americans appear unconcerned by or supportive of the administration's actions. This leads to a sense of hopelessness about the possibility of broad-based opposition.
*   **Concerns About the Future:** There is significant anxiety about the future, focusing on two main fears: that the Republican party will not revert to a pre-Trump state and will continue to embrace authoritarian tactics, and that the Democratic party is failing to propose meaningful structural reforms to counteract this trend. The potential for canceled elections or a failure of constitutional safeguards in 2028 is a recurring concern.
*   **Calls for Action vs. Inevitability of Conflict:** While some users discuss the potential for peaceful resistance or electoral solutions, a prevailing undercurrent suggests that armed conflict may be inevitable to stop a fascist takeover, with historical precedent often cited to support this grim outlook.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 385 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named arin-s has ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro earbuds. The project is notable for being accessible over the internet, allowing users to join a queue and play the game remotely from their PC. The developer has also created a standalone viewer that works on mobile devices, though it currently only plays the game's intro loop without touch controls. Links to the project's GitHub repositories are available on the linked site.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement, curiosity, and technical analysis. The dominant theme was the continuation of the "It Runs Doom" meme, with users celebrating the port as another shrinking frontier for the game's legacy and linking to Wikipedia and Reddit compilations of similar ports. A secondary, more technical thread emerged around the hardware itself, with users discussing the practicality of the PineBuds Pro—specifically their limited battery life and audio quality—while the developer admitted they hadn't used them for their intended purpose.

The conversation also pivoted to a speculative and humorous debate about the feasibility of porting Doom to even more constrained devices, most notably the microcontrollers found in disposable vapes. Users calculated that the hardware in vapes is currently far too limited for such a task, estimating it might take a decade of technological advancement. Finally, a more philosophical discussion arose about the economic implications of such a port. One user questioned whether the ability to run Doom on complex hardware like earbuds represents a triumph of software efficiency or an economic failure to build cheaper, purpose-built hardware. However, another user countered that it's actually a sign of economic success, where economies of scale have made powerful, general-purpose processors the most cost-effective option for a wide range of consumer electronics.

## [Oneplus phone update introduces hardware anti-rollback](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 227 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** OnePlus has released a software update for certain phone models that activates a hardware-based anti-rollback mechanism. This mechanism utilizes "eFuses" within the phone's processor. When the device successfully boots a new firmware version, the bootloader permanently burns a fuse to record the new version number. If a user attempts to install an older firmware version (such as a custom ROM built against an older base), the bootloader detects the version mismatch against the fuse and refuses to boot. This effectively prevents users from downgrading their device's software.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the motivations behind this move, the technical implementation, and the broader implications for device ownership.

A primary theme was the debate over OnePlus's motivations. Several users speculated that the update was a security measure to patch a vulnerability that allowed attackers to bypass theft-locking features by downgrading to an older, unpatched firmware. Others, however, viewed it as an anti-consumer tactic to kill the custom ROM community, force users onto potentially slower official updates, and drive new device sales. The sentiment that OnePlus has lost its "hero" status and become a "villain" was prevalent, with many commenters noting the company's decline since its early days.

Technically, users dissected how the anti-rollback works. It was clarified that the mechanism is part of a secure boot chain where the primary bootloader checks the version of the secondary bootloader (XBL) against the value stored in the eFuses. If the version is lower, the boot process is halted. This is distinct from but similar to Apple's software-based signature enforcement, which also prevents downgrades. Commenters noted that eFuses are a common industry practice, used by Samsung to permanently disable features like Knox upon bootloader unlocking, and are present in most modern CPUs for various functions like disabling debug interfaces.

Finally, the discussion broadened into a philosophical debate about ownership and the right to repair. Commenters argued that such software-activated hardware locks prove that consumers do not truly own the devices they purchase, but are instead in a state of indefinite rental. This was compared to modern automobiles, where manufacturers retain significant remote control over the vehicle's functionality. The consensus was that these mechanisms fundamentally transfer control from the user to the manufacturer, undermining the concept of personal property in the digital age.

## [Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)
**Score:** 304 | **Comments:** 15 | **ID:** 46751826

> **Article:** The article "Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes" serves as a guide to understanding how indexes work in PostgreSQL. It covers fundamental concepts such as B-Tree indexes, multi-column indexes, and the conditions under which the query planner chooses to use them. The piece aims to provide practical knowledge for optimizing database performance, likely explaining the "leftmost prefix" rule and the trade-offs involved in index design.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on validating the article's advice in light of recent PostgreSQL developments and recommending further resources. While commenters praised the article as essential reading and appreciated its direct style, the most significant thread questioned the long-standing "leading column" rule for multi-column indexes. A user noted that PostgreSQL 18's new "index skip scan" feature fundamentally changes this conventional wisdom, allowing the database to use multi-column indexes even when the query does not reference the leading column—something that was previously inefficient. This sparked a debate on the performance implications of bitmap index scans versus standard index scans.

Beyond the article itself, the community frequently referenced "Use The Index, Luke" as the definitive external resource for B-Tree indexing. Other comments touched on related topics, such as the desire for native incremental view maintenance in PostgreSQL and the availability of similar indexing guides for MongoDB.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 295 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports, citing senior local health officials, that the death toll from recent protests in Iran could exceed 30,000. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures. The report references the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which had confirmed 5,459 deaths and was investigating another 17,031 at the time of writing.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, centering on skepticism of the reported death toll, the difficulty of verifying information from Iran, and the technological implications of state censorship.

A primary theme was the difficulty in verifying the 30,000 figure. Many commenters expressed skepticism, drawing parallels to historical instances of intelligence failures or manufactured consent for war, such as the lead-up to the Iraq War. The article's own admission that it could not independently verify the numbers was frequently cited as a reason for caution. However, other users argued that the lack of on-the-ground independent reporting is itself evidence of a severe crackdown, as the Iranian government has restricted access for observers and suppressed information. The debate over the authenticity of leaked videos was also present, with some questioning the footage they had seen while others pointed to the existence of graphic evidence on less-censored platforms and attributed the scarcity of footage to severe internet shutdowns.

A second major theme was the technological battle for information. A detailed comment argued that internet shutdowns have become increasingly sophisticated, rendering many standard digital tools (VPNs, Tor) useless. This led to a call for developers to prioritize "offline-first" applications and build decentralized, resilient communication tools (like mesh networks) that can function without a central internet connection. This sparked a counter-argument that such requirements add significant complexity and are not necessary for all applications, creating a debate about the practicality of building for "darkness" versus building for a typical connected environment.

Finally, the discussion included broader geopolitical and comparative analysis. Commenters compared the situation to other historical events like the bombing of Dresden to contextualize the scale of the alleged casualties. The response in other countries, such as the military in Bangladesh refusing to fire on protesters, was used to highlight the agency of security forces. The conversation also touched on the role of foreign actors, with some comments suggesting the US might be manufacturing consent for war, while another user claimed that imported "Arab thugs" and Russian/Chinese technology were aiding the Iranian government's crackdown and internet censorship.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The article reports that the White House posted an altered arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and ICE protester, to make it appear she was sobbing. The original photo showed her with a neutral expression. The article highlights the administration's unapologetic stance, citing a follow-up post from a deputy communications director stating "the memes will continue," and includes links to the original and altered images as well as subsequent social media commentary from White House officials.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the broader implications of the incident rather than just the specific event. Commenters expressed alarm that the use of AI and digital manipulation for political propaganda has arrived rapidly and is being used unapologetically by government officials. Many argued that the goal of such actions is not to present a specific truth, but to erode the concept of objective truth entirely, making it easier for supporters to dismiss facts that contradict their worldview.

There was significant debate regarding the legal and social consequences. While some suggested the subject of the photo could pursue a libel lawsuit, others countered that the current Supreme Court would likely grant immunity to the administration. The discussion also touched on the "post-truth" nature of modern politics, with users noting that the administration's base appears to support these actions regardless of their veracity. Finally, several comments pivoted to the societal impact of generative AI, worrying that the proliferation of "slop" is dissolving social trust and making it increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fabrication.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 204 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted a nationwide policy creating no-fly zones around mobile Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assets, including ICE ground vehicle convoys. Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), these zones do not have fixed geographic coordinates or published activation times. Instead, the restricted airspace—spanning 3,000 feet laterally and 1,000 feet vertically—moves with the DHS units. This means a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if a convoy passes nearby.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the new policy, with commenters viewing it as a tool for increased government secrecy and potential authoritarian overreach. The primary concerns focus on the lack of transparency and due process. Users argue that by not publishing the location of these moving no-fly zones, the FAA has created a situation where it is nearly impossible for a law-abiding citizen to avoid violating the law, a hallmark of authoritarianism cited by one user.

Several technical and legal loopholes were debated. Users noted that small drones under 250g may evade detection, and it is possible to build custom drones without standard identification beacons (DroneID), potentially bypassing enforcement. However, others countered that for commercially available drones, the policy serves as a "chilling effect" and a legal weapon; authorities can retrospectively identify and charge operators using data emitted by the drone, even if the violation was accidental.

There was also confusion regarding the scope and enforcement of the policy. Commenters questioned how operators are supposed to recognize "mobile assets" and whether the FAA maintains a real-time list of these zones. The ambiguity of what constitutes a protected asset (e.g., a rental car carrying DOE equipment) was highlighted as a significant legal gray area. Finally, speculation arose that the policy might be a precursor to the active jamming or destruction of drones near these convoys, with the NOTAM serving as legal justification for such actions.

## [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world (2019)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
**Score:** 253 | **Comments:** 171 | **ID:** 46758450

> **Article:** The article, based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, argues that non-violent campaigns are remarkably effective at overthrowing governments. The central "3.5% rule" is a finding from her data, suggesting that no government has withstood a challenge where 3.5% of the population actively and non-violently participated. The article posits that such movements succeed by leveraging broad public support and prompting defections among the regime's own supporters, rather than through direct force.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely challenges the 3.5% rule, citing recent and ongoing protests as counterexamples where participation far exceeded this threshold without success. Commenters point to Israel, Iran, Hong Kong, and Belarus as cases where mass mobilization failed to achieve its political goals, suggesting the rule may be outdated or context-dependent.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the role of state violence and modern repression. Users argue that governments have adapted their tactics, using a combination of overwhelming force, sophisticated propaganda (e.g., dismissing protesters as "paid actors"), and legal maneuvering to exhaust and demoralize movements. This has led to a sense that non-violent protest alone is no longer sufficient, with some commenters suggesting that the perceived effectiveness of past movements was partly due to the implicit or explicit threat of violence from other factions (e.g., the Black Panthers alongside MLK).

The discussion also refines the original thesis. One commenter clarifies that Chenoweth herself views the 3.5% figure as a descriptive statistic from historical data, not a prescriptive guarantee for future success. Another key point is that success is not binary; even if a regime isn't overthrown, sustained protest can still create meaningful political change. The conversation also touches on the nature of power itself, with one user arguing that a despot's power is ultimately derived from the population's compliance, making mass non-cooperation a potent, if difficult to organize, alternative to direct confrontation.

**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 18 | **ID:** 46753708

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "DPaint-js," a web-based image editor modeled after the classic Amiga software Deluxe Paint. The project is implemented in vanilla JavaScript and features a clean, readable codebase.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the project, praising its clean code, readable architecture, and nostalgic value. Several commenters, including those familiar with the demoscene, noted the author's talent and highlighted that the tool is actively used to create graphics for competitions.

The discussion also included technical feedback and comparisons. One user reported a bug with the smudge tool's blending behavior across different browsers, which the author acknowledged and began addressing. Another commenter pointed out that a key Deluxe Paint feature—custom brushes—was missing from the main version, though it was noted that this functionality exists in the development version. A separate project, PyDPainter, was mentioned as another desktop-based Deluxe Paint clone.

## [Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems](https://www.diljitpr.net/blog-post-postgresql-dlq)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46755115

> **Article:** The article describes a pattern for implementing a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) using PostgreSQL. The core technique involves a table with a `processed_at` timestamp and a consumer loop that uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to safely dequeue messages for multiple concurrent workers. The author presents this as a simple, durable, and SQL-native alternative to external queue systems like RabbitMQ or SQS, particularly suitable for applications already using PostgreSQL and handling low-to-moderate throughput.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a polarized debate on the viability of using PostgreSQL as a queue, split between pragmatic acceptance and principled opposition.

The primary argument against the approach is that using a database as a queue is an architectural anti-pattern. Critics contend that PostgreSQL is a B-tree with a remote interface, not a queue data structure, and that using it for this purpose will inevitably lead to performance degradation as queue size grows. There are also concerns about reliability, specifically the risk of the DLQ being overwhelmed by a spike in failures, which could cause message loss if not protected by rate limiting or circuit breakers.

Conversely, many developers defend the pattern as a practical and often sufficient solution. They argue that for low-to-moderate volume systems (e.g., thousands of tasks per hour), a Postgres-based queue is easy to implement, provides high visibility, and simplifies the tech stack by avoiding an additional service. Proponents point out that major companies like Segment have successfully used MySQL as a queue at scale, suggesting the concept is viable. This side emphasizes that "premature optimization" is a risk, and a database-backed queue is a perfectly reasonable starting point for most applications that may never reach extreme scale.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on technical implementation details. `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is highlighted as a key feature for enabling concurrent processing, though several commenters offered advice on its proper use, such as combining it with `LIMIT`, managing table statistics (`ANALYZE`), and planning for data lifecycle (deletions or partitioning). There was also a minor thread questioning the combination of `SKIP LOCKED` with tools like Shedlock, which are designed to prevent parallel execution.

## [Over 36,500 killed in Iran's deadliest massacre, documents reveal](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 127 | **ID:** 46760329

> **Article:** The article from Iran International reports on a newly revealed document detailing a massacre in Iran, allegedly killing over 36,500 people in just two days across 400 cities. The report identifies the victims as protesters and attributes the violence to the Iranian regime, specifically noting the use of foreign mercenaries to carry out the killings. The scale of the event is described as one of the deadliest massacres in the country's history.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, focusing on the scale of the violence, the credibility of the source, and the geopolitical implications.

Many commenters expressed shock at the brutality and scale of the killings, particularly the high death toll relative to the short timeframe. Users compared the numbers to historical events like the Tiananmen Square massacre and the ongoing conflict in Gaza to contextualize the severity. There was debate regarding the logistics of such a high death count, with some questioning how it could be achieved without heavy explosives, while others noted that the figure averages to a manageable number of casualties per city given the country's size.

A significant portion of the discussion centered on the source of the report, *Iran International*. Several users pointed out the outlet's funding ties to Saudi Arabia and its bias against the Iranian regime, leading to skepticism about the report's accuracy. Others countered that while the source may be biased, the underlying events and the regime's capacity for violence are well-documented realities.

The conversation also touched on the role of foreign actors and mercenaries. Users noted that the Iranian regime's reliance on external forces (reportedly from Afghanistan and Iraq) to suppress its own population is a double-edged sword, historically leading to instability. There was also criticism directed at U.S. foreign policy, specifically regarding Donald Trump's past promises of support to Iranian protesters which were perceived as encouraging people to take to the streets without providing tangible aid, potentially leading to higher casualties.

Finally, commenters debated the international response and the nature of the violence. Some lamented the perceived apathy of the international community compared to domestic outrage over lesser atrocities in the West. Others discussed the moral distinctions between state-on-state violence versus state-on-citizen violence, questioning why intra-state massacres often garner less sustained global attention than international conflicts.

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Clawdbot," an open-source personal AI assistant designed to run locally on a user's machine (e.g., a Mac Mini). It interacts with desktop applications and messaging services (like WhatsApp and iMessage) to automate tasks, conduct research, and build small apps on the fly, requiring an API key for an LLM like Claude.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of excitement and skepticism regarding Clawdbot's practicality and security. While some users, like hexsprite, report successful real-world applications—such as automating rental screenings and saving hours of time—others, including atonse and HorizonXP, found the setup tedious and the tool buggy, noting issues like lost context and comparing it unfavorably to established tools like Claude Code.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the security implications of granting an AI agent broad system access. Users like bravura and imranq highlighted the risks of prompt injection and the need for strict allowlists, drawing parallels to giving a contractor full access to personal data. There is also a debate on the tool's utility, with some, like blainstorming, questioning if it solves a real problem or merely creates "productivity theater," while others argue that AI lowers the cost of necessary "busy work" enough to unlock value. Ultimately, the community views Clawdbot as a fascinating glimpse into the future of personal automation, albeit one that requires careful tinkering and security considerations.

## [Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m77dmxlvlo)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 145 | **ID:** 46757162

> **Article:** A report has found that a fractured track was the cause of a high-speed train derailment in Spain. The break was described as a "complete lack of continuity" in the rails. The article highlights that several other trains had passed over the damaged section of track before the fatal derailment occurred, indicating a failure in detection systems.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters were shocked by the severity of the track fracture and expressed concern over the failure to detect it before the disaster. The discussion focused heavily on rail monitoring technologies, with users mentioning specialized measurement trains equipped with cameras and LIDAR, as well as the potential for onboard sensors or drones. There was a debate about whether physical barriers between tracks would be effective, with some arguing that the physics of a high-speed derailment would make barriers counterproductive, while others believed prevention was better than mitigation.

A significant portion of the conversation compared Spain's safety record to Japan's Shinkansen, which has maintained a perfect safety record since the 1960s despite higher passenger volumes. Users speculated that this difference might stem from maintenance budgets, operational culture, or quality control systems. The discussion also touched on the causes of rail fractures, noting that continuously welded tracks are under tension and can fail catastrophically, and that extreme weather or even sabotage (referenced in recent European context) can be factors. Finally, commenters debated the age and maintenance history of the specific track involved, with conflicting reports on whether it was newly installed or neglected.

## [Jurassic Park - Tablet device on Nedry's desk? (2012)](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/jurassic-park-tablet-device-on-nedrys-desk.169883/)

> **Article:** The article is a forum thread from The RPF (The Replica Prop Forum) discussing a specific prop from the 1993 film *Jurassic Park*: a tablet-like device seen on the desk of the character Dennis Nedry. The discussion aims to identify the device and uncover its origins. The thread reveals that the prop was not a fictional creation but a real design mockup for a Motorola product called the iRadio (later the Envoy), designed by the firm frogdesign. The head of frogdesign, Hartmut Esslinger, met Steven Spielberg on a plane and gave him the mockup to use as a prop in the film.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly evolved from the specific prop into a broader appreciation for the technological foresight and real-world tech used in *Jurassic Park* and other classic sci-fi films. The conversation is marked by a sense of nostalgia and admiration for the film's production design.

Key points from the discussion include:

*   **Confirmation and Amazement:** Commenters were thrilled by the revelation, with one noting the incredible odds of the actual designer of the prop chiming in to confirm the story. This lent a high degree of credibility to the finding.
*   **Real-World Tech in Film:** The conversation expanded to other real technologies used in *Jurassic Park*. This included the SGI IRIX workstation and its "fsn" file system visualizer (which was a real tool, not just a Hollywood creation), the Thinking Machines Connection Machine CM-5 supercomputer, and even the specific model of circuit breaker used in the power restoration scene. The consensus was that Spielberg had excellent connections to the tech industry of the era.
*   **Sci-Fi Predicting Reality:** Several commenters drew parallels to other works of science fiction that accurately predicted future technology. Arthur C. Clarke's *2001: A Space Odyssey* (the book, written before the moon landing) was cited for its description of a tablet-like device for reading news. The film *Aliens* (1986) was mentioned for its use of a GRiD Compass laptop from 1982, which was itself a futuristic device for its time.
*   **Broader Film Commentary:** The discussion included a critique of the later *Jurassic Park* sequels, with many agreeing that the first film was a masterpiece that balanced character and science, while subsequent movies devolved into less believable sci-fi. One commenter shared a humorous "Jurassic Park Theory of Startups," mapping company roles to characters in the film as a sign of bleak prospects.
*   **Additional Context:** A commenter expressed surprise that the discussion hadn't mentioned General Magic or Magic Cap, a pioneering (but ultimately unsuccessful) early PDA/tablet operating system from the early 90s, which would have been contemporary to the film's release.
