## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 1239 | **Comments:** 741 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This system aggregates data from various government sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicaid. The report highlights concerns over the merging of health data with immigration enforcement capabilities, suggesting that sensitive personal information is being repurposed for surveillance and deportation efforts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply concerned with privacy, government overreach, and the technical infrastructure enabling surveillance. The conversation can be categorized into several key themes:

*   **The Erosion of Privacy and "Nothing to Hide":** Several users argued against the apathetic stance of having "nothing to hide." They emphasized that privacy is a safeguard against abuse of power, particularly citing scenarios involving stalking by abusive partners in law enforcement or the potential for algorithmic errors ("hallucinations") to cause wrongful raids.
*   **Government Overreach and Infrastructure:** There was a consensus that the existence of such data-sharing infrastructure creates a permanent risk. Users expressed skepticism that any future administration would dismantle these tools, noting that systems built for one purpose (e.g., immigration enforcement) inevitably expand to others. Some comments alluded to the "Mark of the Beast" or the necessity of constitutional checks to prevent a "death of the free state."
*   **Technical and Data Integrity Concerns:** Users discussed the technical implications of centralized data. One suggested "poisoning" datasets with bait entries to disrupt the system, while another warned of the dangers of a "One True Database," advocating for data compartmentalization as a safety feature against bad actors.
*   **Debate on Medicaid Data Usage:** A sub-thread debated the legality and logic of using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. While some questioned the connection (noting that undocumented immigrants are generally ineligible for federal Medicaid), others clarified that Emergency Medicaid and state-level programs do create data trails for immigrants. A user noted that ICE likely does not distinguish between legal and illegal status when querying databases.
*   **Political and Economic Context:** Users linked the discussion to broader political issues, such as the debate over the citizenship question on the US Census and the massive budget of ICE (reportedly larger than many world militaries). There was also a debate regarding federalism, with some arguing that social services should remain at the state level to prevent centralized federal databases, while others countered that poorer states cannot sustain their own safety nets.
*   **Censorship and Platform Politics:** A meta-discussion occurred regarding the moderation of HN, with users noting that similar topics had been flagged or removed in the past, debating whether such topics constitute "politics" or relevant tech news.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 626 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the most critical task for any writer is to immediately establish a reason for the reader to be invested in the content. It posits that without an initial hook—whether through narrative, a compelling question, or immediate relevance—technical details or deep analysis will be ignored. The piece suggests that this principle is universal, applying to everything from blog posts to video content, and that failing to prioritize the reader's interest upfront is a fundamental failure of communication.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis while exploring its nuances and potential downsides. A primary theme is the tension between "making the audience care" and respecting their time. Several commenters advocate for a "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) approach, popular in military and technical writing, which prioritizes clarity and directness over narrative hooks. This is contrasted with the "attention-grabbing" techniques common in media, which some view as manipulative or designed to inflate page views rather than serve the reader.

The conversation extends to modern content platforms, particularly TikTok, which is described as a "brute-force attack on human psychology" due to its extreme time constraints. While one commenter finds this dynamic fascinating, another expresses a strong dislike for it, arguing that it trains users to discard anything that doesn't provide immediate gratification. They contrast this with the experience of listening to SiriusXM, where the inability to skip songs forces engagement and leads to discovering new favorites.

Other points of discussion include the importance of knowing your audience (technical vs. non-technical readers), the risk of "burying the lede" in favor of SEO-driven clickbait, and the role of mystery in storytelling. A few commenters noted practical issues with the article itself, such as typos and broken links, while another playfully suggested using an LLM to generate hooks, highlighting the ongoing debate around AI and content creation.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 611 | **Comments:** 193 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Posturr," a macOS application designed to improve ergonomics. The app uses the computer's camera to monitor the user's posture and automatically blurs the screen when it detects slouching, providing a visual cue to correct their position. The project is a small, open-source Swift application.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on privacy concerns, technical implementation, and the practicality of the app's concept. A primary concern for many users was the security risk of running an unaudited, open-source application that requires camera access. While some commenters suggested paying for a notarized version to ensure security, others argued that the app's small codebase makes it easy to audit manually or with an AI assistant.

Technical details were clarified by the author, who explained that the "Claude Mode" notification was a remnant of an experimental feature where he used the Claude AI to analyze screenshots for slouching, which proved too slow and inaccurate. The current version uses a simpler, more effective vision library to detect head height. Commenters also debated the app's effectiveness for users of different heights and the best posture for productivity, with some noting that a proper ergonomic chair or an external monitor setup is a more fundamental solution than a software alert. The discussion also included feature requests, such as adapting the technology to detect when a user isn't wearing their glasses.

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 481 | **Comments:** 221 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article, titled "Yes, It's Fascism," argues that the actions of the Trump administration, particularly concerning ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), constitute a form of fascism. The author contends that ICE operates with impunity, engaging in extrajudicial killings and abductions without due process, drawing direct parallels to historical fascist paramilitary groups like the Nazi Brownshirts. The piece suggests that the administration's rhetoric, such as labeling victims as "terrorists" without investigation, demonstrates systemic intent and a disregard for the rule of law. The article concludes that the combination of state-sanctioned violence, the suppression of dissent, and the consolidation of power around a leader who delegations authority to ideologically aligned extremists meets the definition of fascism.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly in agreement with the article's premise, expressing deep concern and alarm over the current political climate and the actions of ICE. Commenters frequently use historical analogies, comparing ICE to the Nazi Brownshirts and the current administration's tactics to the rise of fascism in 1930s Germany. There is a strong sense of pessimism about the future, with users debating whether the situation can be reversed peacefully or if armed conflict is inevitable. Many are disturbed by the lack of public outcry and the justification of violence by political authorities and conservative media, noting that this normalization is a key feature of fascist regimes.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the systemic nature of the problem. Several users argue that the issue is not just one individual but a broader ideological movement within the administration and its support base. There is also criticism directed at the Democratic party for what is perceived as a weak and inadequate response to the rise of authoritarianism, with fears that even if they win future elections, they will fail to implement the necessary structural reforms to prevent a recurrence.

A notable counterpoint emerges in a sub-thread where a user expresses "semantic satiation" with the word "fascism," arguing that it has been overused for years to describe various political actions, thus losing its impact. This view is sharply rebuked by others who see it as a form of denialism, with one user providing a timeline of warnings from 2015 onwards to suggest that the current situation is the culmination of a long-foreseen trajectory. The conversation also touches on practical concerns, such as the potential for canceled elections in 2026 and the long-term political landscape beyond the Trump era, with a general consensus that the political norms and checks and balances of the past have been irrevocably damaged.

## [Oneplus phone update introduces hardware anti-rollback](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 421 | **Comments:** 252 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** The article reports that OnePlus has introduced a hardware anti-rollback mechanism via a software update. This feature utilizes "eFuses" within the phone's processor. When a user updates their device, these one-time programmable fuses are "blown" to permanently record the new firmware version. Consequently, the phone's bootloader will reject any attempt to install older firmware, effectively preventing users from downgrading their device's software. This change impacts custom ROM users, as they must now ensure their ROM is built against a firmware version equal to or newer than the one currently installed on the device, or the anti-rollback mechanism will trigger and prevent the device from booting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the motivations behind OnePlus's move and the broader implications for device ownership. A primary theme was the conflict between user freedom and corporate control. Many commenters viewed this as a "villain arc" for OnePlus, marking its shift from a user-centric brand to one that restricts modifications, likely to curb theft and enforce its software ecosystem.

Technical explanations clarified that eFuses are a common industry practice for preventing security exploits via firmware downgrades and are used by other manufacturers like Samsung for features like Knox. The mechanism works by having the bootloader check a version number burned into the fuses against the firmware being installed; a mismatch prevents the device from booting.

A significant portion of the debate revolved around the concept of ownership. Users argued that if a manufacturer can remotely alter a device's core functionality and prevent users from installing their preferred software, true ownership is compromised. This was compared to practices in the automotive industry, where software updates can limit user control. While some defended the move as a necessary security measure against theft and vulnerabilities, the prevailing sentiment was that it represents a loss of user autonomy and further entrenches manufacturer control over personal hardware.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 406 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named arin-s has successfully ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro earbuds. The project is notable for being accessible over the internet, allowing users to join a queue and play the game remotely from their own computers via a web browser. The developer has also provided links to the GitHub repositories for the project.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement, curiosity, and technical analysis. The dominant sentiment was one of appreciation for the novelty, with users celebrating the ongoing trend of porting Doom to increasingly unconventional devices. This led to discussions about the "list of Doom ports" and a dedicated subreddit for such projects.

Several commenters were curious about the hardware itself, specifically the PineBuds Pro. One user asked about their quality, and the developer admitted they had never used them for their intended audio purpose. Another user who owns the buds confirmed they are a great device but noted a limited battery life of around two hours with ANC enabled.

A significant portion of the discussion shifted to the underlying economics and engineering of modern electronics. One user posed a philosophical question: whether this phenomenon represents a triumph of efficient software over minimal hardware or an economic failure to build cheaper, purpose-built chips for simple tasks like audio transmission. Another user countered that it's more likely an economic success, where economies of scale have made powerful, general-purpose microcontrollers the cheapest option for many applications, even if they are overkill. This was supported by the observation that a single modern earbud contains more processing power than was globally available in 1980.

Finally, the conversation sparked speculation about future "Doom ports." Commenters humorously suggested running the game on disposable vape CPUs and water pumps, with one user providing a technical analysis of why a vape's microcontroller (with only 3KB of RAM) is currently insufficient for Doom's 4MB requirement.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 310 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The article from Ars Technica reports that the White House posted an altered arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and ICE protester. The official White House X (formerly Twitter) account manipulated the image to make it appear as though she was sobbing during her arrest. The post was accompanied by the caption "the memes will continue." The article highlights the rapid and unapologetic adoption of generative AI technology for political propaganda by a government entity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the White House's actions, focusing on the implications for truth, political discourse, and social trust. Key themes include:

*   **Erosion of Truth and Credibility:** Many commenters view this as a dangerous step in the weaponization of AI for political propaganda. The act is seen as part of a broader "post-truth" strategy, where the goal is not to present a factual narrative but to make the concept of objective truth seem unknowable, thereby discouraging people from questioning their preconceptions. The White House's shameless admission and mockery of the act further underscore a perceived collapse in credibility.
*   **Political Polarization and Base Support:** A significant point of discussion is the role of the political base. Commenters argue that the MAGA base will support such actions regardless of their factual inaccuracy. This is framed as a symptom of a deeper political divide where allegiance to a party or leader supersedes commitment to factual integrity.
*   **Legal and Social Consequences:** The discussion touches on potential legal ramifications, such as a libel or slander case against the White House, though skepticism is raised about the feasibility of a fair trial or success in the Supreme Court. More broadly, commenters express deep concern about the societal impact, describing the US as a "failed democracy" and worrying about the dissolution of social trust in an era of AI-generated "slop."
*   **The Future of AI and Misinformation:** The event is cited as a real-world confirmation of long-held fears about AI being used for scams and political manipulation. This has led to a pervasive sense of skepticism, where users now question the authenticity of any video or image they encounter online.

## [Iran's internet blackout may become permanent, with access for elites only](https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-blackout-tiered-internet/)
**Score:** 308 | **Comments:** 225 | **ID:** 46761822

> **Article:** The article from Rest of World explores the possibility that Iran's recent internet blackouts, implemented during civil unrest, could become a permanent, two-tiered system. Under this model, the general public would be restricted to a heavily censored "intranet" of domestic services, while government elites retain access to the global internet. The piece details the technical measures being used, such as deep packet inspection and aggressive VPN blocking, and highlights the poor quality of existing domestic alternatives, which fail to match the functionality of global platforms. It also notes the economic consequences of such a shutdown and the ongoing technological cat-and-mouse game between censors and citizens trying to circumvent the blocks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the global implications of Iran's internet strategy and the technical feasibility of a national firewall. A central theme is the concern that Western democracies are also moving toward greater internet censorship, with commenters pointing to the EU's blocking of Russian sites, the UK's age verification laws, and Spain's network blocks during sports events as examples of a "slippery slope." Many argue that these actions, while different in scale, follow a similar logic of state control over information access.

The conversation also debates whether a total internet cutoff is sustainable. Skeptics argue that the economic and productivity damage would be too severe for any regime to withstand long-term, citing North Korea as a grim but isolated model. However, others counter that authoritarian governments may prioritize power over economic prosperity, making such a scenario plausible if they are willing to use extreme force.

Technically, participants explored the effectiveness of censorship circumvention. Some expressed disappointment that satellite internet services like Starlink were not a silver bullet, with others explaining that radio-frequency jamming is a well-established and effective countermeasure. The difficulty of completely sealing a network was also highlighted, with the point made that Iran's allies (like Russia and China) could provide alternative internet peering routes, making a total global disconnect challenging to enforce. Finally, a few commenters with direct experience in Iran clarified that the current blackouts are more severe than past filtering, making VPN use nearly impossible and causing significant hardship for ordinary citizens.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 165 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** The TIME article reports that senior Iranian health officials have estimated the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. This figure is significantly higher than previous estimates from groups like the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRNA), which had confirmed around 5,500 deaths and was investigating over 17,000 more. The article notes that TIME was unable to independently verify the officials' figures, and the primary source cited is a German-Iranian eye doctor.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is polarized, focusing on skepticism of the reported numbers and the geopolitical context rather than the human tragedy itself. A central theme is the questioning of the article's source and intent. Several commenters express doubt, citing the lack of on-the-ground independent verification and drawing parallels to historical instances where intelligence was used to build a case for war, such as the WMDs in Iraq. They suggest the high death toll could be "manufacturing consent" for foreign intervention.

Conversely, other users argue that the absence of independent observers is a direct result of the Iranian government's actions, including severe internet shutdowns and jamming of communications. They contend that the difficulty in verifying the numbers should be seen as evidence of the regime's brutality, not as a reason to dismiss the reports. One commenter pointed to the existence of graphic videos on gore websites as grim evidence, while another noted the internet blackouts make it nearly impossible to get footage out.

A secondary discussion thread emerged around the technical aspects of the crackdown. One commenter made a plea for the tech community to build "offline-first" and decentralized communication tools (like mesh networks) to empower activists in the face of state-controlled internet blackouts. This sparked a debate on whether such features should be a foundational requirement for all software or a niche consideration.

Finally, some commenters debated the statistical plausibility of the 30,000 figure, comparing it to historical events like the bombing of Dresden, while others dismissed such comparisons as irrelevant. The conversation also touched on the brutality of the crackdown, with mentions of imported thugs and systematic raids on hospitals, and a hope for external assistance.

## [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world (2019)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
**Score:** 288 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46758450

> **Article:** The article, based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, posits the "3.5% rule": the theory that no government has withstood a challenge when 3.5% of its population participates in active, non-violent protest. The article argues that such movements are successful because they are more inclusive, harder to repress, and can trigger loyalty shifts within a regime's security forces and bureaucracy, ultimately making the status quo untenable for those in power.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely challenges the universality of the "3.5% rule," citing recent and ongoing protests as counterexamples where high participation has not yet led to regime change. Commenters point to mass protests in Israel, Iran, Hong Kong, and Belarus as evidence that the rule may not hold against modern, resilient authoritarian regimes. A key theme is that governments have evolved their tactics, using more subtle repression, surveillance, and propaganda to discredit movements (e.g., labeling protesters as "paid") without resorting to overt violence that might generate sympathy.

The conversation also delves into the nuances of the original research. One commenter clarifies that Chenoweth herself views the 3.5% figure as a descriptive historical statistic, not a guaranteed prescription for future success. The debate further explores the role of violence versus non-violence, with some arguing that non-violence is only effective when backed by the credible threat of violence, while others discuss how opposing factions can complicate any simple percentage-based rule. The discussion concludes with a philosophical point on the power of individuals versus collective action, contrasting the impact of assassins with the sustained power of mass movements.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 274 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted nationwide drone no-fly zones around Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Energy (DOE) operations, including mobile assets like ICE vehicle convoys. Unlike standard Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), these zones do not provide specific geographic coordinates or activation times. Instead, the restricted airspace—a 3000-foot lateral and 1000-foot vertical bubble—moves with the DHS assets. This means a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if a convoy passes nearby.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the policy, focusing on its potential for abuse and its vague, arbitrary nature. Commenters argue that the lack of specific coordinates or public notification makes it nearly impossible for a drone operator to avoid violating the rule, which many see as a hallmark of authoritarianism. There is concern that this policy is designed to legally target individuals recording ICE operations, as modern drones emit registered IDs that can be used for after-the-fact prosecution.

Several technical aspects were debated. Users discussed the feasibility of circumventing the rules, noting that while commercial drones like DJI have geofencing, these can often be disabled, and custom-built drones can easily ignore regulations. The sub-250g drone category was mentioned as being less trackable.

The ambiguity of "mobile assets" was a key point of contention. One commenter noted that the rule applies not just to ICE but to DOE and DOD assets as well, raising questions about how an operator could possibly identify a "mobile asset" (e.g., a rental car carrying sensitive equipment). There was also speculation that the NOTAM might be a precursor to using jamming or anti-drone weapons under the guise of protecting restricted airspace.

## [Clawdbot - open source personal AI assistant](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot)
**Score:** 258 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46760237

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Clawdbot," an open-source personal AI assistant designed to run locally on a user's machine. It is positioned as a tool that can control the desktop, integrate with messaging apps, and perform various personal tasks, requiring an API key for an LLM (with a preference for Claude models).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of excitement and skepticism regarding Clawdbot, focusing heavily on its setup, utility, and security implications.

Users are divided on the bot's current stability. While some, like the original poster, encountered deprecation warnings during installation, others noted these were likely harmless. However, several users reported significant bugs, such as the bot forgetting context seconds into a conversation. Despite these issues, early adopters who successfully configured the tool described a "wow" moment, particularly when using it for practical tasks like automating apartment rental screenings via Facebook Messenger or organizing notes.

The conversation highlights a tension between the tool's potential and its practical application. Some commenters view it as a "kludge" around missing APIs, while others appreciate the focused "guardrails" it provides compared to general-purpose tools like Claude Code. A recurring theme is the debate over whether the tasks the bot automates (like organizing files) actually derive value from being organized, or if this is merely "productivity theater."

Security concerns are a major thread throughout the discussion. Users expressed anxiety about the permissions required, comparing it to handing over control to a new contractor. The risk of "prompt injection" was specifically flagged as a significant danger, with one user warning about the "lethal trifecta" of security vulnerabilities. While some users appreciated the "safety gloves off" approach for its flexibility, others urged caution, emphasizing the need for strict allowlists before granting access to sensitive data or financial tasks.

**Score:** 232 | **Comments:** 23 | **ID:** 46753708

> **Article:** The article links to "DPaint-js," a GitHub repository for a web-based image editor created by Steffest. The application is modeled after the classic Amiga program Deluxe Paint, aiming to replicate its functionality and nostalgic feel within a modern browser environment. It is implemented using vanilla JavaScript.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to DPaint-js, praising its clean, readable code and the author's skill. Commenters appreciated the project's departure from complex modern frameworks, noting its use of vanilla JavaScript and a decoupled event bus architecture. Several users highlighted the author's background in the demoscene, linking to recent graphical works created with the tool to demonstrate its capabilities.

Technical feedback was constructive, with one user reporting a bug in the smudge tool's blending behavior across different browsers. The author responded directly in the thread, acknowledging the issue and pushing an update to the development version to address it. While most praised the nostalgic interface, one user critiqued the dark theme as a departure from the original Deluxe Paint's light theme and noted the absence of a specific perspective tool.

A debate emerged regarding how closely the tool mimics the original Deluxe Paint. One commenter argued it fails to replicate the defining feature of custom brushes, though another noted that this functionality is present in the development version. The discussion also branched into recommendations for other Deluxe Paint clones, such as the Python-based PyDPainter and the DOS-based VGA Paint 386.

**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46755115

> **Article:** The article proposes using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for event-driven systems, where failed messages are stored for later analysis or retry. It details a practical implementation using a standard table structure and the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` command. This SQL feature allows multiple worker processes to safely dequeue messages in parallel without locking the entire table, ensuring high concurrency and preventing workers from blocking each other. The author argues that for many applications, this approach is simpler and more robust than introducing a separate dedicated message queue system, leveraging PostgreSQL's existing durability, visibility, and query capabilities.

## [Scientists identify brain waves that define the limits of 'you'](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-brain-waves-that-define-the-limits-of-you)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46760099

> **Article:** Researchers have identified a specific brain rhythm, the parietal alpha frequency (around 10 Hz), as a key mechanism that defines the boundaries of the self by determining how the brain integrates sensory signals to create a sense of body ownership. Using the classic rubber hand illusion, the study found that the speed of these alpha waves dictates the temporal window for binding visual and tactile information; faster waves narrow this window, making an artificial hand feel more like one's own, while slower waves widen it, reducing this feeling. Crucially, the team used non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to artificially alter participants' alpha wave frequencies, which directly and predictably changed their subjective experience of body ownership, establishing a causal link between this specific brain activity and the fundamental feeling of "where the self ends."
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was largely positive, with commenters highlighting the significance of the study's causal manipulation of brain waves to alter a subjective experience of self. Many found the direct link between a measurable brain rhythm and the feeling of body ownership to be a profound and somewhat unsettling discovery, with some noting it makes the self feel "fragile."

A central theme was the philosophical implication of the findings, sparking a debate on mind-body dualism. One commenter framed it as distinguishing between "having a body" and "being a soul," while others pushed back, arguing that consciousness is an emergent process of the body and that dualism is an unhelpful model.

The conversation also branched into related topics. Some users humorously commented on the "non-invasive" nature of a technique that can alter one's sense of self, while others explored the potential for practices like meditation to modify these brain states. The discussion also touched on the physical extent of the human body's electric field and its measurability, with references to heart fields and sensitive medical sensors. Finally, a few comments connected the research to broader concepts like phantom limb syndrome and the fictional hive mind from *Star Trek: Picard*.

## [Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m77dmxlvlo)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46757162

> **Article:** A report has found that a fractured track was the cause of a recent high-speed train derailment in Spain. The break was described as a "complete lack of continuity," creating a significant gap in the rails. The article highlights that several other trains had passed over the damaged section before the fatal derailment, but the anomaly went undetected. This incident is noted as the second fatal high-speed train derailment in Spain in the past twenty years, contrasting with the spotless safety record of Japan's Shinkansen since the 1960s.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the failure of track monitoring systems and the broader context of rail safety. Commenters were surprised that such a substantial fracture could go undetected, especially since earlier trains had reportedly shown signs of damage (notches in their wheels). This led to speculation about the adequacy of current inspection methods. Several users mentioned specialized measurement trains equipped with cameras and LIDAR (like the UK's "New Measurement Train" or Germany's "RAILab") that are used for track inspection, questioning why these systems didn't catch the defect. There was also a debate about equipping all trains with basic sensors for real-time anomaly detection.

A secondary theme involved the physical infrastructure and safety barriers. While some suggested physical barriers between tracks to prevent derailments from crossing over, others argued this was impractical due to the immense energy of a high-speed train, which could exacerbate the disaster. The consensus leaned toward preventing derailments through better monitoring rather than mitigating their consequences.

Finally, commenters provided additional context, noting that the fractured rail was reportedly from 1989 and may have suffered from poor maintenance, though there were conflicting reports about whether it was a new or old section of track. The conversation also touched on the physics of continuously welded tracks and the possibility of sabotage, given recent geopolitical tensions and attacks on European rail infrastructure.

## [Over 36,500 killed in Iran's deadliest massacre, documents reveal](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46760329

> **Article:** The article from Iran International reports on a document revealing that over 36,500 people were killed in a two-day massacre in Iran, allegedly carried out by the regime in response to protests. The killings reportedly occurred across 400 cities, with the majority of victims being executed after being arrested or while in hospitals, rather than dying during the initial clashes. The article frames this as the deadliest massacre in the country's modern history.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding the article focuses on the scale of the violence, the credibility of the source, and the geopolitical implications.

Commenters expressed shock at the sheer number of casualties, comparing the death toll to historical events like the Tiananmen Square protests and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Many debated the logistics of how such a high number of deaths could be achieved in such a short timeframe, concluding that systematic executions of arrested protesters and hospital patients were likely the primary method rather than just battlefield combat.

A significant portion of the debate centered on the source of the report, *Iran International*. Skeptics noted the outlet is backed by Saudi funding and possesses a clear anti-regime bias, with some speculating it could be a "state-aligned influence media" asset. However, other users argued that this bias does not necessarily invalidate the report, as the Iranian regime's brutality is well-documented.

The conversation also touched on the effectiveness of foreign intervention and sanctions. Some users criticized Donald Trump’s previous rhetoric for potentially encouraging protesters without providing actual support, leading to higher casualties. Others debated whether civil disobedience or internal revolution would be effective, with historical references to Machiavelli suggesting that relying on foreign mercenaries could destabilize the regime but also risks betrayal.

Finally, there was a meta-discussion about the global response. Several commenters lamented that the event received relatively little attention compared to domestic issues in Western nations, attributing this to desensitization or geopolitical bias. Others argued that the brutality of the Iranian regime confirms its totalitarian nature, making peaceful protest increasingly unlikely to succeed.

## [The browser is the sandbox](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/25/the-browser-is-the-sandbox/)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 102 | **ID:** 46762150

> **Article:** The article "The browser is the sandbox" by Simon Willison argues that modern web browsers provide a robust, battle-tested sandbox for running untrusted code, particularly relevant for AI-assisted coding tools. Instead of relying on complex and potentially fragile container setups, developers can leverage the browser's inherent security model—enforced by JavaScript, WebAssembly, and strict permission systems—to safely execute code. The piece highlights the File System Access API and the `webkitdirectory` attribute as key technologies that allow web applications to interact with local files (like a user's project folder) within the browser's secure confines, offering a powerful alternative to traditional desktop applications or server-side execution for development tasks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters expressing surprise and interest in the practical capabilities of browser sandboxing, particularly the ability to request access to a local folder via `webkitdirectory`. The conversation centers on the trade-offs between the maturity and security of the browser sandbox versus the flexibility of traditional containers or system-level access. While browsers are lauded for their extensive, battle-tested security surface, some note that this comes at the cost of being limited to browser capabilities (e.g., no direct hardware access).

Several technical points were raised:
*   **File System Access API:** A key concern was whether permission to a directory could be persisted across sessions. This was clarified as having been improved in Chrome, though mobile behavior may still differ.
*   **Git Worktrees:** One user suggested using Git worktrees as an ideal companion to this approach, allowing developers to isolate the browser's potentially destructive file modifications in a disposable branch.
*   **Security Nuances:** The discussion touched on the limitations of Content Security Policies (CSP) and the potential of WebAssembly as an even more robust sandboxing technology. The historical context of browser plugins (Flash, ActiveX) was also mentioned as a cautionary tale.
*   **Author Skepticism:** A minor thread questioned the author's motives, but this was quickly countered by other long-time bloggers who defended Simon Willison's prolific and unbiased writing style.

## [ICE tells legal observer, 'We have a database, now you're a domestic terrorist'](https://reason.com/2026/01/23/ice-tells-legal-observer-we-have-a-nice-little-database-and-now-youre-considered-a-domestic-terrorist/)
**Score:** 147 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46761130

> **Article:** The article from Reason.com reports that a legal observer was told by an ICE agent that they are now considered a "domestic terrorist" because the agency has a database of individuals. The incident allegedly occurred while the observer was recording ICE agents in public. The article frames this as part of a broader trend where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is treating the act of following and recording federal immigration officers as obstruction of justice, citing a 1150% increase in assaults against agents. The piece highlights concerns over the use of facial recognition databases and the labeling of political dissenters as terrorists.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is highly critical of the government's actions and skeptical of the article's claims, though some users attempt to fact-check the source material. 

A central theme is the weaponization of language and surveillance. Users argue that the term "domestic terrorist" is a politically charged label used to justify violence against state enemies, drawing parallels to the "War on Terror" and historical COINTELPRO operations. There is significant concern regarding the use of facial recognition databases and the potential for blackmail, though one commenter counters that ICE agents themselves are the ones hiding their identities, implying they fear public exposure.

Several commenters express cynicism regarding the tech industry's role in building these surveillance tools, suggesting that engineers often take pride in their work for government agencies rather than feeling shame. 

Regarding the specific incident, the discussion reveals a divide. While many accept the report as evidence of authoritarian overreach, a skeptical user ("zahlman") critiques the Reason article's methodology. They argue that the article relies on a single video clip lacking context and that the claim of a DHS policy against recording is based on a misinterpretation of a spokesperson's statement about obstruction. This user contends that in previous instances of alleged First Amendment violations, the arrested individuals were often committing physical obstruction, though they acknowledge the video provided does not show enough context to verify the specific claim of the observer being a "legal observer."

## [I was right about ATProto key management](https://notes.nora.codes/atproto-again/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46757357

> **Article:** The author, NoraCodes, details their frustrating experience trying to set up a self-hosted ATProto PDS (Personal Data Server) using a custom domain and the `did:web` identity method. The core issue is that they previously "burned" (deleted) an account associated with that domain on the main Bluesky network. When they tried to reuse the domain for a self-hosted server, they discovered that the "burn" is a centralized, permanent block enforced by Bluesky's servers. This prevents the domain from ever being used to identify an account on the main Bluesky network again, effectively breaking interoperability and making self-hosting for that domain impossible. The author argues this is a critical flaw in ATProto's key management and a sign that the protocol's decentralization claims are undermined by centralized choke points.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revolves around the tension between Bluesky's promise of decentralization and its current centralized reality. Several key themes emerge:

1.  **Centralization vs. Decentralization:** This is the dominant theme. Commenters like `mdasen` and `grishka` argue that Bluesky is highly centralized in practice, citing the `did:plc` registry and the AppView as single points of control. They express skepticism that Bluesky will ever truly cede control, drawing parallels to how platforms like Google Talk initially embraced federation (XMPP) before closing it off. The "burn" problem is seen as a prime example of this centralized control hindering true self-hosting.

2.  **Architectural Debates:** A significant counter-argument, led by `echelon`, is that both ATProto and Mastodon's federated models are flawed. They advocate for a fully peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture as the only way to achieve true decentralization and avoid the pitfalls of both federation (instance-level bans, central points of failure) and centralized protocols.

3.  **Practicality and User Experience:** Many commenters focus on the practical difficulties. The author's experience is seen as a legitimate failure, with `bnewbold` (a Bluesky developer) acknowledging the poor documentation and lack of a self-serve process for healing identity problems. Others, like `wolvoleo`, compare ATProto's complex key management unfavorably to the simpler, more user-friendly key management in the P2P protocol Nostr.

4.  **Defense of the Current Approach:** Some commenters defend Bluesky's current state. `arghandugh` argues that the author's problems stem from using an immature, edge-case feature (`did:web`) when the more stable, centralized option (`did:plc`) is the intended path for most users. `ddtaylor` suggests that centralization is a necessary, temporary phase to ensure quality before the federated network is ready.

5.  **Broader Critiques:** The discussion also included minor threads on the complexity of the protocol acting as a gate for non-technical users and a brief, separate complaint about the article's difficult-to-read font choice.
