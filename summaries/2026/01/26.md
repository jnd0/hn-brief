# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-26

## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 1146 | **Comments:** 681 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This tool aggregates data from various sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses Medicaid records. The article frames this as a significant privacy violation, arguing that the fusion of healthcare data with law enforcement targeting systems endangers individuals and demonstrates a lack of accountability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the reported data sharing, focusing on the dangers of surveillance infrastructure and the erosion of privacy. A central theme is the fallacy of the "nothing to hide" argument; users argue that even benign data can be misused or misinterpreted by powerful agencies, leading to severe consequences like mistaken raids or targeting by bad actors within the system.

There is significant skepticism regarding the legality and ethics of the data pipeline. While some debate whether Medicaid actually contains data on undocumented immigrants—distinguishing between general eligibility and emergency coverage—others counter that ICE likely does not care about legal distinctions once data is aggregated. The conversation also touches on the political implications, noting that such tools could be used to target "undesirably unhealthy" citizens and reflecting on past debates like the citizenship question on the census.

Several comments focus on the systemic nature of the problem. Users express pessimism that the infrastructure will ever be dismantled, as government agencies rarely relinquish surveillance capabilities. There is a strong sentiment that engineers working on these tools bear moral responsibility, with some suggesting "soft quitting" to sabotage projects from within. The discussion also includes calls for federalism (devolving power to states) as a check against centralized data collection, though this is acknowledged to have its own downsides.

## [A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 668 | **Comments:** 344 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The article, posted on the statistical modeling blog "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science," critiques a highly influential paper in management science that has been cited over 6,000 times. The author argues that despite its massive influence, the paper is fundamentally flawed. The post highlights the broader problem of "citation inflation," where papers gain momentum and are cited uncritically by other researchers without being properly vetted or replicated. The author suggests that the academic incentive structure, which rewards novelty over replication, contributes to the propagation of such flawed research and calls for a cultural shift where single studies are not treated as definitive proof.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes and analyzing the systemic issues that allow flawed or fraudulent research to persist and accumulate citations. A central theme is the personal and professional risk involved in challenging established work. Several users shared stories of failed replication attempts, noting that pushing for retractions can be career-threatening, especially for junior researchers facing tenured senior academics. There is a consensus that the "replication crisis" and the "don't rock the boat" culture are significant problems, not just in psychology but across various scientific fields, including biotech and sensor development.

Commenters also explored potential solutions and the nature of the problem. One user proposed a "trust network" to overlay the citation graph, tagging papers and authors that cite known flawed work, though others were skeptical that such a system could avoid being gamed. The discussion touched on the ethics of labeling researchers as "bad people," with some arguing for nuance and focusing on systemic pressures rather than individual malice. A practical suggestion for researchers was to pursue "contrarian research" that produces novel, conflicting results, as this is often more publishable than a direct replication study. Ultimately, the conversation reinforced the article's call for skepticism, advising readers to treat single studies as hypotheses to be tested rather than established facts.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 593 | **Comments:** 291 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The article at netzbremse.de alleges that Deutsche Telekom (DT), Germany's largest ISP, is intentionally throttling the internet by under-dimensioning its network transit access points. The core accusation is that DT maintains insufficient capacity at internet exchange points, forcing external internet services to pay for direct, expensive contracts with DT to ensure their content reaches DT customers at acceptable speeds. This practice effectively penalizes services that do not have a direct paid relationship with the ISP, leading to slow loading times and poor performance for users on the DT network.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of technical analysis and widespread user frustration with Deutsche Telekom. Several users confirm experiencing the described issues, particularly slow loading times for websites hosted on services like Cloudflare, with some reporting complete outages or minute-long latencies during peak hours.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Technical Verification:** Users point to DT's poor peering practices, specifically a refusal to maintain adequate capacity at the DE-CIX (German Internet Exchange) or to peer cost-neutrally with major content delivery networks like Cloudflare. This forces traffic through inefficient, congested routes.
*   **Monopoly and Infrastructure:** A major point of contention is DT's de facto monopoly in many areas, particularly new developments, where no other ISP can offer service at a reasonable price. Commenters suggest Germany failed to enforce open-access infrastructure policies, unlike countries such as Switzerland, leaving consumers with little choice.
*   **Broader Criticism of DT:** The complaints extend beyond throttling to general service unreliability, including DSL lines failing in rain and slow customer support. Several users shared anecdotes of switching providers (like Vodafone) or even moving homes to escape DT's service.
*   **Cultural and Societal Contradictions:** The thread broadens into a critique of German society, noting the paradox of being a leading economy with advanced infrastructure that is often hampered by bureaucracy, lobbying, and strange regulations (like the "radio tax" while net neutrality suffers).
*   **Workarounds:** Users discussed alternatives like Starlink for reliable, weather-independent internet, though it is noted that physical obstructions can make satellite internet unviable in some locations.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 567 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Posturr," an open-source macOS application designed to improve ergonomics. The app uses the computer's camera to monitor the user's posture and automatically blurs the screen when it detects slouching, encouraging the user to sit up straight.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the app with a mix of interest, skepticism, and humor. The primary themes were security concerns, technical implementation, and the practicality of posture correction.

A significant point of discussion was security. Several users expressed hesitation about running an unaudited, open-source application that requires camera access. While some suggested auditing the code themselves (noting it's a small, single-file project), others felt the developer should seek official notarization and charge for the app to build trust. The developer confirmed the code is simple and open-source, making it easy to review.

Technical details sparked curiosity, particularly a "Claude Mode" notification mentioned in the code. The author clarified this was an experimental and abandoned feature where he used the Claude AI to analyze screenshots for slouching, which proved too slow and inaccurate. The current, effective version uses a simpler, direct vision library to detect head height.

Users also debated the app's practicality. Some questioned how it could accurately detect slouching across different body heights, leading to a discussion about calibrating to a user's "best" posture. Others argued that good posture is difficult to achieve with a laptop and requires an external monitor setup. The conversation broadened to include general advice on ergonomics, with some users sharing their own "productive" but unconventional sitting positions and recommending high-end office chairs or standing desks as more effective solutions. A few humorous comments were made about the screen already being blurry without glasses, and one user suggested a similar app for detecting when they aren't wearing their glasses.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 545 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the most critical task for a writer is to immediately engage the reader's interest. It posits that regardless of the quality or depth of the content that follows, if the opening fails to establish relevance or intrigue, the audience will disengage. The piece likely explores techniques for creating compelling hooks and emphasizes that this initial connection is a prerequisite for effective communication, especially in a digital landscape saturated with distractions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central premise but explores the tension between capturing attention and respecting the reader's intelligence. A recurring theme is the conflict between narrative, "make me care" openings and the technical audience's preference for direct, detailed information. Many commenters, particularly those with technical backgrounds, expressed frustration with what they see as manipulative or overly dramatic hooks, advocating instead for principles like "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) or simply starting with the interesting part first. This was framed as a choice between serving the reader versus serving metrics like page impressions.

The conversation also branched into a broader critique of modern attention economies. One thread compared the article's hook to the hyper-optimized, constantly evolving hooks on TikTok, viewing it as a "brute-force attack on human psychology." This sparked a counterpoint where users shared their aversion to this dynamic, citing a deliberate preference for less choice (like listening to satellite radio) to avoid the "skip" reflex and allow for deeper appreciation of content.

Finally, the discussion touched on related concepts. Some commenters linked the need for a strong hook to the nature of storytelling itself, suggesting that good fiction functions as a mystery that the audience wants to solve. Others offered practical advice, such as the importance of understanding one's specific audience before deciding on an approach, and a minor but noted point was the simple necessity of proofreading.

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 441 | **Comments:** 209 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article, written by David Frum for *The Atlantic*, argues that the actions of the Trump administration, particularly regarding the use of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), constitute fascism. Frum contends that the administration is employing state-sanctioned violence, the creation of an internal enemy, and the disregard for due process—hallmarks of historical fascist regimes. The piece uses the recent killing of an individual by ICE agents as a focal point to illustrate a pattern of escalating authoritarianism and the normalization of state violence against civilians.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with the majority of commenters agreeing with the article's premise that the current political climate exhibits fascist characteristics. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **ICE as a Fascist Instrument:** Many users draw direct parallels between ICE and historical paramilitary groups like the Nazi Brownshirts. They argue that ICE agents are ideologically aligned, poorly trained, and operate with impunity, leading to extrajudicial killings. The administration's immediate labeling of victims as "terrorists" is seen as evidence of systemic intent to justify violence.

*   **Historical Parallels and Warnings:** Commenters frequently reference 1930s Germany and the rise of Nazism. There is a shared sense of dread that the U.S. is following a familiar path toward authoritarianism, with some users citing Umberto Eco's essay on "Ur-fascism" to define the current political moment.

*   **Political Inertia and Future Outlook:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the perceived failure of the Democratic party to mount an effective opposition. Users express fear that even if Trump leaves office, the Republican party will not moderate, and Democrats will fail to implement necessary structural reforms, leading to a repeat of the current situation in the future. There is deep pessimism about the 2028 election and beyond.

*   **Desensitization and Semantic Satiation:** One dissenting viewpoint argues that the term "fascism" has been overused by critics for years, leading to "semantic satiation" where the word has lost its impact. This user suggests that constant warnings have desensitized them to the label, though they acknowledge the severity of the current events. This view is met with sharp rebuttals from others who see it as a form of denialism.

*   **Public Apathy and Media Influence:** Several commenters note the lack of widespread public demonstrations, attributing this to a combination of fear (that protests will provoke martial law) and the effectiveness of conservative media in framing ICE's actions as necessary for national security. They observe that many Trump supporters actively cheer on the crackdowns.

## [Oneplus phone update introduces hardware anti-rollback](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 398 | **Comments:** 238 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** An article on Consumer Rights Wiki reports that OnePlus has released a software update for certain phone models that activates a hardware-based anti-rollback mechanism. This mechanism uses "eFuses" (electronic fuses) integrated into the phone's Qualcomm processor. Once a user updates to a new firmware version, a physical fuse is permanently "blown," recording the new version number in the hardware. This prevents the phone's bootloader from ever loading any older firmware, effectively blocking users from downgrading their operating system. The article notes this is a common practice in the industry, used by Samsung for its Knox security platform, but its introduction via a software update on existing OnePlus devices has raised concerns about user control and ownership.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of OnePlus, framing the move as a betrayal of its enthusiast-focused origins and a step toward becoming a typical "villainous" corporation. The community debated the primary motivation behind the change, with several theories emerging:

*   **Security:** The most cited reason is to patch a low-level vulnerability that allowed attackers to bypass theft-protection lockouts by downgrading the phone to an older, unpatched firmware. This aligns with carrier and industry requirements for secure devices.
*   **Control:** A more cynical view is that it allows OnePlus to kill the custom ROM scene, force users to accept potentially undesirable updates, and make downgrading impossible, thereby increasing control over the user experience and potentially driving new sales.
*   **Technical Implementation:** Users with technical knowledge explained that eFuses are standard in modern CPUs for securing boot processes, preventing IMEI tampering, and disabling debug features. The consensus is that this is a hardware-enforced check that cannot be bypassed by simply flashing a new OS partition.

The discussion also broadened into a philosophical debate on digital ownership. Commenters argued that such mechanisms prove that consumers don't truly own their devices, comparing it to modern cars that "phone home" to the manufacturer. There was also a comparison to Apple's software-based downgrade prevention, with users expressing frustration over the lack of user agency in both ecosystems. Ultimately, the sentiment was one of disillusionment with OnePlus, with many commenters noting the company has lost its way since its early "flagship killer" days.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 397 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named arin-s has ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro earbuds. The project is notable for being accessible over the internet, allowing users to join a queue and play the game on the earbuds from their own PC. The developer has also created a standalone viewer that works on mobile devices, though it currently only plays the intro loop without interactive controls. Links to the project's GitHub repositories are available on the linked site.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement and technical curiosity, typical for "it runs Doom" projects. The discussion quickly evolved into several distinct themes.

The most prominent theme was the continuation of the "Doom on everything" meme. Commenters shared links to a comprehensive Wikipedia list of Doom ports and a dedicated subreddit (r/itrunsdoom). The conversation humorously pushed the boundaries of this meme, with users speculating about running Doom on a disposable vape's microcontroller. One commenter provided a technical analysis, noting that the typical vape MCU has only 3KB of RAM, far short of the 4MB required, and jokingly predicted such a port might be possible in a decade.

A more philosophical debate emerged about the nature of modern hardware. One user questioned whether the ability to run Doom on such a small device represents a triumph of software efficiency or an economic failure to build cheaper, purpose-built hardware. However, other commenters countered that this is more accurately a story of economic success, where economies of scale have made powerful, general-purpose microcontrollers the cheapest option for many applications, even when their full capabilities are not needed.

Finally, there was practical discussion about the PineBuds Pro hardware itself. A user asked for opinions on the earbuds, and another user who owns them confirmed they are a "great device" but noted a significant limitation: the battery life is quite short, lasting only about two hours with Active Noise Cancellation enabled.

## [Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)
**Score:** 306 | **Comments:** 16 | **ID:** 46751826

> **Article:** The article "Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes" serves as a guide to understanding how indexes work in PostgreSQL. It covers fundamental index types, focusing primarily on B-Tree indexes, and explains their internal mechanics, such as how they store data and are traversed. The post also discusses multi-column indexes, outlining the rules for their effective use (specifically the "leftmost prefix" rule), and touches on other index types like Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN. It concludes with practical advice on when to use each type and how to approach index creation for optimal database performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the quality of the article and the evolving nature of indexing best practices, particularly concerning multi-column indexes. Commenters widely praised the article as an excellent, in-depth introduction and frequently recommended the external resource "Use The Index, Luke" as a complementary or more comprehensive guide. The PostgreSQL official documentation was also linked as a highly readable and essential resource.

A key technical debate emerged around multi-column indexes and the traditional "leading column" rule. One commenter noted that their experience with recent PostgreSQL versions contradicted this rigid rule, as the database was able to use an index via a bitmap index scan even when the query didn't reference the leading column. This prompted a response from a PostgreSQL contributor who clarified that while such scans were possible in older versions, they were inefficient (requiring a full index scan). The discussion concluded with the significant update that PostgreSQL 18 introduces "index skip scan," a feature that will make multi-column indexes more flexible and efficient, challenging long-held conventional wisdom on the topic.

Other points of discussion included:
*   A debate on the performance of B-Tree versus Hash indexes, with conflicting conclusions drawn from the article's benchmarks versus general wisdom that B-Trees are superior for sequential-like data (e.g., IDs).
*   A request for a "Use the Index, Luke" equivalent for MongoDB.
*   A side conversation about incremental view maintenance (IVM) in PostgreSQL, with commenters noting the complexity of the problem and pointing to extensions like `pg_ivm` or specialized databases like TimescaleDB that offer similar functionality.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 301 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The article reports that the White House posted an altered arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and ICE protester, to make it appear she was sobbing during her arrest. The article notes that the White House deputy communications director admitted to the alteration, stating "the memes will continue," and that other officials mocked fact-checkers who debunked the image. The incident is presented as a rapid and unapologetic adoption of generative AI for political propaganda.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion frames the incident as a disturbing confirmation of long-held fears regarding the weaponization of AI for political disinformation. Commenters express dismay at the speed with which these tools have been normalized for propaganda, noting a resulting erosion of trust in digital media where even authentic content is met with skepticism.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the political implications and the concept of "post-truth" politics. Users argue that the administration's goal is not to convince the public of a specific narrative, but to overwhelm the information ecosystem to the point where objective truth feels unknowable, thereby insulating supporters from factual counter-arguments. There is a consensus that the administration's base remains unbothered by such actions, leading to broader concerns about the health of US democracy and the dissolution of social trust.

The discussion also touches on potential legal repercussions, with users debating the merits of a libel or slander case against the White House, though many are pessimistic about the outcome given the current political climate and Supreme Court rulings. Ultimately, the conversation highlights a deep anxiety about the future, viewing this event not as an isolated incident but as a harbinger of how AI will be used to manipulate public perception and bypass accountability.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior local health officials in Iran have estimated the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. This figure is significantly higher than previous estimates. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures, and the primary source cited is a German-Iranian eye doctor. The report also mentions that the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating over 17,000 more.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on skepticism towards the reported death toll and the potential geopolitical motivations behind the reporting.

A significant portion of the comments express doubt about the 30,000 figure. Some users, citing the lack of on-the-ground independent verification and the historical precedent of the Iraq WMD intelligence failure, suggest the numbers could be "manufactured consent" for military intervention. This skepticism is further fueled by observations that videos of the crackdown seem inconsistent, with some commenters noting a lack of gore or bodies in certain clips, while others counter that footage is scarce due to severe internet shutdowns and can be found on gore websites.

Conversely, other users argue that the high death toll is plausible, pointing to the Iranian government's well-documented brutality and its use of internet blackouts and jammed communications (including Chinese and Russian technology) to prevent evidence from escaping. One commenter makes an impassioned plea for the tech community to build "offline-first" and decentralized communication tools, arguing that developers have become complacent and are being "out-engineered" by authoritarian states.

The discussion also includes a comparison of the death toll to historical events like the Dresden bombing, which was dismissed by some as a "stupid comparison." The conversation touches on the role of the Iranian regime's security forces, including imported militias, and expresses a general sense of tragedy and hope for the Iranian people's eventual freedom. The debate remains unresolved, with participants weighing the credibility of the sources against the historical context of state-sponsored narratives.

## [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world (2019)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
**Score:** 269 | **Comments:** 189 | **ID:** 46758450

> **Article:** The article, based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, posits the "3.5% rule": the theory that no government has withstood a challenge when 3.5% of its population actively participates in non-violent mass protests. The article argues that such movements succeed by being broad-based, non-violent, and disruptive, which encourages defections from the regime's own supporters and security forces. It cites historical examples like the People Power Revolution in the Philippines to support this claim.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely challenges the universality of the "3.5% rule," citing recent and ongoing protests as counterexamples. A primary theme is the rule's apparent failure in modern authoritarian states. Multiple users point to protests in Israel, Iran, Hong Kong, and Belarus, where large-scale demonstrations (well exceeding 3.5% of the population in some cases) have not led to regime change. Commenters suggest that modern governments have developed more effective tactics for suppressing non-violent movements, such as overwhelming force, sophisticated propaganda, and co-opting the narrative by dismissing protesters as illegitimate or paid actors.

Another key point of debate is the role of violence. One commenter argues that non-violence is only effective when there is a credible threat of violence from another faction (e.g., MLK Jr. and the Black Panthers). This view is countered by others who maintain that non-violence remains a powerful tool for building broad public support, as most people are unwilling to endorse violence.

The discussion also clarifies the original research. One user, citing Chenoweth's own recent work, notes that the 3.5% figure is a descriptive statistic from historical data, not a prescriptive guarantee of success. The effectiveness of movements is context-dependent and has declined as repressive regimes adapt. The conversation concludes with a philosophical point about the nature of power, arguing that individual actions like assassination are less effective than mass, collective refusal to comply, which undermines a regime's power base more fundamentally.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 263 | **Comments:** 206 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE and other DHS mobile assets. Unlike traditional temporary flight restrictions, these no-fly zones are not tied to specific geographic coordinates or fixed times. Instead, they move with the assets, creating a 3000-foot lateral and 1000-foot vertical "bubble" around convoys and vessels. This means drone operators could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if a DHS unit passes nearby, potentially leading to legal penalties without prior warning.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the new policy, viewing it as a tool for secrecy and authoritarian control rather than safety. The dominant sentiment is that the rule is intentionally vague to make it impossible for the public to avoid violating it, thereby giving law enforcement broad power to penalize drone operators.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Vagueness and Enforcement:** Commenters argue that the lack of published coordinates or activation times makes the rule unconstitutionally vague. They compare it to laws designed to ensure everyone is technically breaking the law, allowing authorities to selectively enforce it. There is concern that operators could be penalized for flying legally in public spaces simply because a DHS asset entered the area.
*   **Surveillance and Privacy:** Many users interpret the move as a way to prevent the public from recording or monitoring ICE operations. It is seen as a "chilling effect" to deter surveillance. Some noted that since modern drones emit registered IDs, the rule serves as a legal weapon to identify and prosecute operators after the fact, even if the violation was accidental.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** Discussion touched on whether the rules are enforceable. While some mentioned that sub-250g drones or custom-built drones without DroneID could bypass tracking, others debated whether manufacturers like DJI still enforce geofencing. The consensus was that while evasion is technically possible, the risk of criminal charges deters most people.
*   **Scope and Absurdity:** Users pointed out that the restriction applies not just to ICE but to all DHS and DOD mobile assets. One commenter highlighted the absurdity of a vehicle acting as a "portable do-not-fly zone," questioning how an operator is supposed to recognize a "mobile asset" (e.g., a rental car) versus a civilian vehicle.
*   **Potential Countermeasures:** There was speculation that this NOTAM (Notice to Air Missions) might be a precursor to using jamming or anti-drone weapons against intruding drones, providing legal cover for destruction or interception.

## [Show HN: Bonsplit – Tabs and splits for native macOS apps](https://bonsplit.alasdairmonk.com)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 30 | **ID:** 46753301

> **Project:** Bonsplit is a native macOS library for developers that adds tab and split pane functionality to AppKit and SwiftUI applications. The library provides a polished, drag-and-drop interface for managing multiple views within a single window, similar to the "Origami" mode in Sublime Text. The project is accompanied by a highly polished, visually impressive website that serves as its documentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to Bonsplit was largely positive, with users praising the library's aesthetic polish and the quality of its accompanying website. However, the discussion revealed some initial confusion regarding the project's scope. Several commenters mistakenly assumed it was a system-wide utility that would add tabs to all native macOS apps, rather than a developer library intended to be integrated into specific applications. Once clarified, developers appreciated the utility, particularly for document-based apps where native macOS tabbing (which operates at the window level) might not be sufficient.

Key points of discussion included:
*   **Clarification of Scope:** Users corrected their initial understanding that Bonsplit is a library for app developers, not a standalone window manager for end-users.
*   **Comparison to Native APIs:** One developer questioned the necessity, noting that AppKit already provides native tabbing APIs. Others countered that Bonsplit offers more granular control (tabs and splits within a single window) that native APIs do not.
*   **Praise for Design:** The website's design was a major topic, with commenters impressed by its beauty and the "love of the game" demonstrated by the effort put into documentation.
*   **Feature Requests:** A user noted the absence of a "tear-off" feature to drag tabs into new windows and back again.
*   **Nostalgia:** The concept reminded some users of tiling window managers from other platforms (like Linux's Ion3/Notion) or specific editor modes (Sublime Text).

## [Web-based image editor modeled after Deluxe Paint](https://github.com/steffest/DPaint-js)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 19 | **ID:** 46753708

> **Article:** The article links to "DPaint-js," a web-based image editor created by Steffest that is modeled after the classic Amiga software Deluxe Paint. The project is implemented in vanilla JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub. It aims to replicate the nostalgic feel and functionality of the original application for modern web browsers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to the project, with commenters praising the clean, readable, and well-structured vanilla JavaScript code. Many expressed appreciation for the nostalgia factor and the simplicity of a focused project free from the constraints of enterprise or startup development environments.

Discussion quickly expanded to include the creator's background, with users noting that Steffest is a talented demoscene artist who has used the tool to create entries for competitions. Several other Deluxe Paint clones were mentioned as alternatives, including PyDPainter (Python-based) and VGA Paint 386 (a DOS application).

Technical feedback was also a key part of the conversation. One user identified a bug with the smudge tool's blending behavior, which the original author acknowledged and quickly addressed with an update. A more significant point of contention arose regarding the tool's faithfulness to the original. One commenter argued that DPaint-js is not a true clone because it lacks a defining feature of Deluxe Paint: the ability to instantly turn selected pixels into a custom brush. However, another user countered that this functionality is present in the project's development version, suggesting it is still under active improvement.

## [Clawdbot - open source personal AI assistant](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 138 | **ID:** 46760237

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Clawdbot," an open-source personal AI assistant. The project is designed to be a versatile agent that can run on personal hardware (like a Mac Mini or Ubuntu PC) and connect to various services (iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) to automate tasks. It requires an API key for a Large Language Model (LLM), with a preference for Claude, to power its interactions and decision-making.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of excitement and caution regarding Clawdbot, centering on its setup difficulty, practical utility, and significant security risks.

**Setup and Stability**
Initial impressions of the tool are polarized. While some users find the installation tedious and encounter deprecation warnings, others note these are ignorable upstream issues. The software is described as "buggy" by some early adopters, particularly regarding context retention in conversations. However, users who persist through the tinkering phase report that it becomes a powerful tool, capable of controlling desktop environments and automating workflows.

**Practical Use Cases and Value**
There is a debate on whether Clawdbot represents a genuine productivity leap or just "productivity theater." Skeptics compare it to the hype around tools like Notion or Obsidian, questioning if the effort to organize digital life yields real value. Proponents argue that by drastically lowering the cost of "busy work" (like organizing notes or screening messages), AI agents unlock value that was previously too time-consuming to pursue. Concrete success stories include automating apartment rental screenings via Facebook Messenger and scheduling viewings, saving users hours of manual effort.

**Security and Safety Concerns**
Security is the most prominent concern in the discussion. Users are wary of the extensive permissions required to control desktops and messaging apps, comparing it to handing over access to a new contractor. The risk of **prompt injection** is specifically highlighted as a major danger. While some users appreciate the "safety gloves off" approach that allows for powerful automation, others warn that this recklessness could lead to disastrous outcomes, such as an agent accidentally sending damaging messages or making unauthorized changes. The consensus is that users must implement strict allowlists and guardrails before granting access to sensitive accounts like banking or personal messaging.

## [Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems](https://www.diljitpr.net/blog-post-postgresql-dlq)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46755115

> **Article:** The article describes a pattern for implementing a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in an event-driven system using PostgreSQL. It outlines a table schema to store failed messages and details a processing mechanism using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to allow multiple worker processes to safely dequeue and retry failed messages without conflicts. The author argues that this approach is a good fit for systems already using PostgreSQL, offering simplicity, transactional integrity, and ease of querying compared to external queueing systems, especially for low-to-medium throughput scenarios.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a strong divide between pragmatists and purists regarding the use of PostgreSQL for queueing. The primary debate centers on scalability and suitability. Many commenters argue that while using Postgres for a DLQ or task queue is a perfectly reasonable starting point for the vast majority of applications with low-to-medium volume, it is not a robust solution for high-scale systems. They highlight that Postgres is fundamentally a b-tree, not a queue data structure, and will eventually face performance bottlenecks with high insert/delete rates and table bloat. However, proponents counter that for most business applications, the simplicity, transactional safety, and powerful queryability of a Postgres-based queue are invaluable and far outweigh the eventual scaling limitations.

A significant portion of the technical discussion focused on the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` pattern, which was a key takeaway for many. Commenters shared tips on its effective use, emphasizing the importance of `LIMIT` clauses, careful `ORDER BY` for fairness, and managing table maintenance (like `ANALYZE` and cleanup via `pg_cron` or partitioning) to prevent performance degradation. There was also a notable concern about the failure mode of a DLQ itself; if the database is overloaded, it could fail to ingest new dead letters, causing message loss. Ultimately, the consensus was that using Postgres as a queue is a common and viable pattern, especially for systems that aren't at extreme scale, but requires careful implementation and awareness of its inherent trade-offs.

## [Over 36,500 killed in Iran's deadliest massacre, documents reveal](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46760329

> **Article:** The linked article from Iran International reports on a newly revealed document detailing a massacre in Rasht, Iran, allegedly killing over 36,500 people in just two days. The report attributes the killings to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and suggests the victims were largely protesters arrested during the 2019 nationwide uprisings. The article frames this as evidence of the regime's extreme brutality and the failure of international sanctions to incite regime change.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article focuses on three primary themes: the credibility of the source, the mechanics and scale of the violence, and the geopolitical implications.

**Source Credibility and Bias**
A significant portion of the debate centers on the reliability of the source, Iran International. Several users noted that the outlet is funded by Saudi interests and possesses a clear anti-Iranian regime bias, with some labeling it a potential "CIA front" or "state-aligned influence media." This skepticism was bolstered by a quote from journalist Mehdi Hasan, who criticized Western media for uncritically accepting high casualty figures from Iran while simultaneously questioning similar figures from Gaza.

**Scale and Methods of the Massacre**
Users expressed shock at the logistics of killing 36,500 people in 400 cities within 48 hours. Speculation arose regarding the methods used; while some questioned how it was possible without heavy explosives, others calculated that the average death toll per city was relatively low (approx. 91), suggesting a coordinated execution of detainees rather than a single battle. The discussion also highlighted the regime's reliance on foreign mercenaries (specifically from Afghanistan and Iraq) to suppress domestic dissent, insulating the government from potential mutiny among its own military.

**Geopolitical and Moral Context**
The conversation broadened to include the international response and moral comparisons. Users compared the death toll to the Tiananmen Square massacre (noting the Iranian numbers are significantly higher) and the ongoing conflict in Gaza. There was criticism of U.S. foreign policy, specifically regarding Donald Trump’s past promises of assistance to Iranian protesters, which some commenters argued may have inadvertently led to more deaths by encouraging resistance without providing support. Finally, the discussion touched on the effectiveness of sanctions, with users debating whether economic pressure actually hurts the regime or simply strengthens its grip through the use of hired mercenaries.

## [Spanish track was fractured before high-speed train disaster, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m77dmxlvlo)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46757162

> **Article:** A BBC article reports that a high-speed train derailment in Spain was caused by a fractured section of track, described in an official report as having a "complete lack of continuity." The incident resulted in multiple fatalities. The article highlights that several trains had passed over the damaged track before the derailment occurred, suggesting the failure went undetected by routine inspections. The focus is on the physical cause of the accident and the immediate investigation findings.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the failure of safety systems and the comparative safety records of different countries' rail networks. A central theme is the lack of effective monitoring for track fractures. Users debated the feasibility of various detection technologies, including dedicated measurement trains equipped with LIDAR and cameras (like the UK's "New Measurement Train"), continuous electronic sensors, and even on-board cameras on all trains. There was a consensus that the gap in the track should have been detected, with many expressing surprise that existing systems failed.

A significant portion of the conversation compared Spain's safety record to Japan's Shinkansen, which has maintained a perfect safety record since the 1960s despite higher passenger volumes. Commenters speculated that Japan's success stems from superior maintenance budgets, rigorous quality control, and a deeply ingrained safety culture, contrasting it with the recent series of rail incidents in Spain.

The discussion also touched on the physics of derailments. Users argued against the idea of physical barriers between tracks, explaining that the immense energy of a high-speed derailment would likely make such barriers ineffective or even counterproductive. Instead, the focus remained on preventing derailments in the first place through better track integrity monitoring. Technical details about track maintenance, such as the tension in continuously welded rails and the materials used for sleepers, were also briefly explored to provide context on how tracks can fail.

## [Iran's internet blackout may become permanent, with access for elites only](https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-blackout-tiered-internet/)
**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46761822

> **Article:** The article from Rest of World explores the possibility that Iran's recent, severe internet blackouts could evolve into a permanent, "tiered" internet system. This model would grant full, unrestricted access to a small group of elites (such as government officials, security forces, and key academics) while the general population would be confined to a heavily censored and monitored national intranet. The piece details the technical measures being employed, including deep packet inspection to block VPNs and advanced jamming techniques to disrupt satellite internet services like Starlink. The primary motivation for this shift is to quell civil unrest and maintain political control by preventing citizens from organizing and accessing uncensored information, even at the significant cost of crippling the national economy and isolating the populace.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the broader implications of Iran's actions, with a strong focus on whether this model could be adopted elsewhere and the technical feasibility of such a system.

A dominant theme was the concern that Western nations are not immune to similar trends. Commenters pointed to existing and proposed regulations in the EU ("chat control"), UK (age verification for adult content), and Spain (blocking internet access during events) as evidence that censorship is increasing globally. Many argued that these governments also employ a "whataboutism" defense, downplaying their own restrictions by comparing them to more extreme cases like Iran's.

The economic viability of a severely restricted internet was heavily debated. Skeptics argued that a complete cutoff would be an economic "death sentence" and that regimes must balance control with economic stability. However, others countered that authoritarian governments prioritize power over prosperity, citing North Korea as a successful, albeit grim, model for maintaining control despite economic collapse and technological isolation.

Technical aspects were also a key point of discussion. Users shared on-the-ground experiences, describing how advanced filtering makes VPNs increasingly difficult to use and how the state is experimenting with "whitelisting" to make circumvention nearly impossible. The effectiveness of jamming Starlink satellites was debated, with some suggesting it's a localized and manageable problem, while others noted the long-established principles of radio frequency jamming. Finally, the idea of an international sanctions response (e.g., refusing to peer with Iran) was dismissed as impractical, as Iran could easily route its traffic through allies like Russia or China.
