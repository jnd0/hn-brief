## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 1215 | **Comments:** 712 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This tool aggregates data from various government sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicaid. The article highlights concerns over the merging of health data with immigration enforcement infrastructure, suggesting that this integration could lead to privacy violations and the misuse of sensitive personal information for deportation purposes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the surveillance infrastructure, focusing on the dangers of data aggregation and the potential for abuse of power.

**Privacy and the "Nothing to Hide" Fallacy**
Several users argued against the common apathy toward privacy. Commenters noted that data misuse doesn't require malicious intent—simple errors or "hallucinations" in data could lead to wrongful raids. The conversation highlighted that privacy is essential for protecting vulnerable populations, such as victims of domestic abuse stalked by law enforcement officers.

**Data Integration and Medicaid**
Users debated the validity of using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. While some questioned the direct link between Medicaid and undocumented immigrants, others clarified that states may offer limited coverage or that emergency Medicaid creates a data trail. A recurring sentiment was skepticism that ICE distinguishes between legal and illegal status when accessing these databases.

**Political and Structural Implications**
The discussion touched on broader political themes, including the growth of the "surveillance state" and the federal budget. Some commenters argued that the consolidation of data contradicts the principle of federalism (states' rights), suggesting that decentralized systems are safer against bad actors. There were also references to historical debates, such as the 2018 citizenship question on the census, reflecting ongoing concerns about government data collection targeting specific demographics.

**Tech Industry Responsibility**
A segment of the discussion focused on the role of engineers and companies like Palantir. Users expressed frustration that such tools are built despite ethical concerns, with some suggesting that "quiet quitting" or internal sabotage might be ways to resist, while others lamented the lack of political will to dismantle these systems once established.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 594 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Posturr," a macOS application designed to monitor a user's posture via their webcam. If the app detects the user is slouching, it blurs the screen to encourage them to sit up straight. The project is a single Swift file and is open source.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive regarding the concept of posture monitoring but raises several practical and technical concerns. A primary theme is security and trust; commenters expressed hesitation about running unaudited, open-source software that accesses the camera. However, others countered that the codebase is small enough to be easily audited by an AI or a human, making it less risky.

Technical details sparked curiosity, particularly a notification mentioning "Claude Mode." The author clarified this was an experimental, abandoned feature where they used the Claude AI to analyze screenshots for slouching, which proved too slow and inaccurate compared to the current simple head-height detection method. Users also debated the app's effectiveness for people of different heights and the ergonomics of laptop use in general, with many agreeing that an external monitor is necessary for good posture. Other suggestions included adapting the technology for different use cases, such as detecting when a user isn't wearing their glasses. Finally, some commenters discussed the relationship between posture and productivity, with one suggesting that a high-end ergonomic chair is key to maintaining good posture.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 589 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the primary job of a writer is to earn the reader's attention by establishing a compelling reason for them to care about the subject matter immediately. It posits that technical details, while important, are ineffective if the audience is not first emotionally or intellectually invested. The piece suggests that narrative non-fiction and storytelling techniques are essential for bridging the gap between complex information and reader engagement, contrasting this with the common tendency to bury the "lede" or lead with dry facts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis, with many users agreeing that capturing attention is the crucial first step in communication. However, the conversation quickly diverges into a debate about the methods and consequences of doing so.

A primary theme is the tension between narrative hooks and technical substance. Several commenters note that while "making someone care" is effective, it often comes at the expense of detail, especially for technical audiences who prefer to "get straight to the details." This leads to a critique of modern web writing, where the pressure to create viral, attention-grabbing content (driven by SEO and metrics) encourages writers to bury the lede and omit crucial information in favor of a more palatable narrative.

The discussion also explores the psychological impact of this "attention economy." Users point to TikTok as the ultimate example, where creators have only seconds to hook a viewer, leading to a constant, brute-force evolution of psychological triggers. Several commenters expressed a negative view of this trend, describing it as "soul-destroying" and a form of "brainrot" that trains people to abandon anything that doesn't provide immediate gratification. This was contrasted with the "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) communication style, often used in the military and by some content creators, which respects the audience's time by stating the point directly rather than using manipulative hooks.

Finally, the conversation touched on related concepts. Some argued that "understanding your audience" is an even more fundamental first step than simply making them care. Others connected the idea of hooks to the nature of storytelling itself, suggesting that all good fiction functions as a "mystery" that the human brain is naturally compelled to solve.

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 465 | **Comments:** 216 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article from *The Atlantic* argues that the actions of the Trump administration, specifically regarding ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), constitute fascism. It draws direct parallels between current events and historical fascist regimes, focusing on the use of state-sanctioned violence, the lack of due process, and the administration's immediate justification of lethal force by labeling victims as "terrorists." The piece posits that the systemic intent and the culture of impunity within enforcement agencies are hallmarks of authoritarian rule, moving beyond mere policy disagreements into the realm of fundamental threats to democratic norms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and centers on the validity of the "fascism" label, the severity of ICE's actions, and the political future of the United States.

A significant portion of the commenters strongly agree with the article's premise, comparing ICE agents to historical paramilitary groups like the Nazi Brownshirts. They express deep concern over specific incidents where ICE agents have killed individuals, viewing these not as isolated training failures but as symptoms of a systemic culture of impunity and political radicalization within the agency. Many users link this directly to the Trump administration's rhetoric, arguing that figures like Stephen Miller represent a genuine fascist ideology driving these policies.

Conversely, a recurring counter-argument focuses on "semantic satiation"—the idea that the term "fascism" has been overused by critics for years, diluting its impact and making it difficult to take seriously even when current events seem to fit the definition. Some commenters express skepticism about the severity of the situation, attributing the violence to poor training and lack of oversight rather than a coordinated ideological purge.

The conversation also pivots to the future of American politics. There is significant anxiety about what happens after the current presidency, with fears that the Republican party has permanently shifted toward authoritarianism. Simultaneously, there is criticism of the Democratic party for failing to propose meaningful structural reforms to counter these trends, with some users fearing a cycle where temporary Democratic victories fail to address root causes, leading to a return of even more effective authoritarian leadership in the future.

Finally, practical concerns were raised about access to the article, with users sharing archive links to bypass paywalls and captchas, and recommendations for further reading on the definition of fascism, such as Umberto Eco’s "Ur-Fascism."

## [Oneplus phone update introduces hardware anti-rollback](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 416 | **Comments:** 242 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** OnePlus has released a software update for certain phone models that introduces a hardware-based anti-rollback mechanism. This mechanism utilizes eFuses—tiny, one-time programmable memory bits within the processor—to permanently record the current firmware version. When the phone boots, the bootloader checks this stored version; if a user attempts to install older firmware (such as a previous version of the OS or a custom ROM built on older vendor blobs), the boot process is rejected. While the article notes this is a common industry practice to prevent security exploits and theft, the update's timing and implementation have sparked controversy regarding user control over their devices.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 402 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named arin-s has ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro, a pair of open-source wireless earbuds. The project is notable not just for the port itself, but for its implementation: the developer has made the game accessible over the internet, allowing users to join a queue and play Doom on the earbuds remotely from their own computers. The project's website provides links to the relevant GitHub repositories.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement, curiosity, and technical analysis. The dominant theme was the continuation of the "Doom on anything" meme, with users celebrating the shrinking list of devices incapable of running the game and linking to resources like the Wikipedia list and the r/itrunsdoom subreddit.

Several comment threads branched off into technical and practical discussions:
*   **Hardware specifics:** Users inquired about the PineBuds Pro themselves, with the developer admitting they haven't used them for audio and another user providing a real-world review noting their limited battery life (~2 hours with ANC).
*   **The "Vape Chip" Challenge:** A popular sub-thread humorously speculated about porting Doom to the disposable vape CPU, with one user providing a technical analysis that concluded it would take a decade of Moore's Law to meet Doom's memory requirements.
*   **Economic & Philosophical Implications:** One user pondered whether the ability to run Doom on such a device is a triumph of software efficiency or an economic failure to build cheaper, purpose-built hardware. Another countered that it's a sign of economic success, where economies of scale make powerful, general-purpose hardware the most cost-effective option for many applications.
*   **Misinterpretation:** A few commenters initially misinterpreted the project, thinking it involved controlling or viewing the game through audio signals, before realizing it was a standard port.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 307 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The article reports that the White House posted an altered arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and ICE protester, to make it appear she was sobbing. The article notes that the White House deputy communications director admitted to the alteration, stating "the memes will continue," and that other officials mocked fact-checkers who debunked the image. The incident is presented as a rapid and unapologetic adoption of generative AI for political propaganda.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely condemns the White House's actions, viewing them as a dangerous escalation in the use of AI for political manipulation and a further erosion of public trust. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **The Weaponization of AI:** Many commenters express dismay that the predicted use of generative AI for political propaganda has arrived so quickly and brazenly. There is a shared sense of anxiety that this technology will accelerate the dissolution of social trust, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish reality from fabrication.

*   **Erosion of Truth and Credibility:** A prominent theme is the concept of a "post-truth" political strategy. One user argues that the goal is not to present a false narrative as truth, but to make the very notion of objective truth seem unknowable, thereby discouraging people from questioning their preconceptions. The administration's shameless admission and subsequent mockery of fact-checkers are seen as evidence of this strategy.

*   **Political Polarization and Base Support:** The discussion highlights the deep political divide in the US. Several users argue that the administration's base does not care about the deception, suggesting that such actions are politically effective within that segment. The incident is framed as part of a larger, more destructive political project (referencing "Project 2025").

*   **Legal and Societal Implications:** Commenters explore potential legal recourse, such as a defamation lawsuit, but express pessimism about its success, with some suggesting the Supreme Court would grant immunity. There is a broader concern that this behavior is symptomatic of a "failed democracy" and that generative AI, while technically impressive, is proving detrimental to society as a whole by fueling distrust.

*   **Counterpoints and Nuance:** One user cautioned against using online comments as a reliable indicator of public perception, a point noted as ironic given the topic of AI-faked images. Another commenter shifted the focus to socioeconomic factors, suggesting that robust safety nets and lower inequality are the most effective long-term antidotes to rising far-right politics.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 298 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior local health officials in Iran have claimed the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures, with the primary source cited being a German-Iranian eye doctor. The report contrasts this number with previous estimates and mentions that the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has confirmed a lower number but is investigating thousands more cases.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is polarized, focusing primarily on the credibility of the death toll figures and the geopolitical context.

A significant portion of the debate centers on skepticism regarding the source and the potential for misinformation. Several commenters draw parallels to historical events used to justify military intervention, specifically citing the "WMDs in Iraq" narrative. They argue that the lack of on-the-ground independent reporting, combined with the timing of such reports, suggests a potential manufacturing of consent for war rather than a verified humanitarian concern. Conversely, other users argue that the Iranian government's strict censorship and internet shutdowns make independent verification nearly impossible; the absence of evidence due to suppression should not be mistaken for evidence of absence.

The discussion also touches on the technical and logistical aspects of the conflict. One commenter analyzes the difficulty of disseminating information due to sophisticated internet shutdowns, urging the tech community to prioritize "offline-first" and decentralized communication tools for crisis zones. Others debate the authenticity of leaked videos, with some alleging manipulation (e.g., enhanced audio, lack of blood) while others point to the existence of graphic evidence on fringe websites and the difficulty of uploading content during blackouts.

Finally, there are comparisons to other historical and current events. Commenters compare the alleged death toll to the bombing of Dresden to contextualize the scale, though this was criticized as an irrelevant comparison. The situation in Iran is also contrasted with recent protests in Bangladesh, highlighting the role of security forces' willingness to obey or disobey orders.

## [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world (2019)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 196 | **ID:** 46758450

> **Article:** The article, based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, posits the "3.5% rule": the theory that no government has withstood a challenge when at least 3.5% of the population actively participates in non-violent mass protests. The article argues that such movements are successful because they are more inclusive, harder to repress, and can trigger loyalty shifts among key elites, ultimately making the status quo untenable for a regime.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely challenges the universality and contemporary relevance of the 3.5% rule, citing recent examples where large protests have failed to achieve their immediate goals. A central theme is that modern authoritarian regimes have developed more sophisticated methods of control that can neutralize the rule's effectiveness. Commenters point to recent mass protests in Israel, Iran, Hong Kong, and Belarus as counterexamples where mobilization far exceeding 3.5% did not result in regime change or significant policy shifts. These failures are attributed to factors like state-controlled media, the co-opting of opposition messaging, and the ability of regimes to absorb dissent without making concessions.

Another key point of debate is the role of violence versus non-violence. One commenter argues that non-violent movements are only effective when there is a credible threat of violence from a parallel group, citing the historical relationship between Martin Luther King Jr. and the Black Panthers. This sparked a discussion on the nature of political power and whether assassination is a viable strategy, with one user arguing it's counterproductive as it reinforces the idea of individual power rather than collective action.

Finally, the discussion clarifies the original research. A user points out that Chenoweth herself has noted the declining effectiveness of non-violent protest in the face of evolved state repression. Another user provides a crucial clarification from Chenoweth's work, emphasizing that the 3.5% figure is a descriptive statistic from historical data, not a prescriptive guarantee of success, and that building broad public support is essential.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 267 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operations. Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), these restrictions are not tied to specific geographic coordinates or fixed times. Instead, they create a moving "bubble" of restricted airspace—3000 feet laterally and 1000 feet vertically—that follows mobile DHS assets, such as ground vehicle convoys and vessels. This means a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if a DHS convoy passes nearby, potentially facing legal consequences without prior warning or clear boundaries.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the new policy, with commenters expressing concerns over transparency, civil liberties, and the potential for abuse of power. A dominant theme is the view of this policy as a tool for authoritarian control, with users arguing it creates "impossible to not break" laws and serves to shield government actions from public scrutiny. The lack of specific, published coordinates for these mobile no-fly zones is a major point of contention, with many seeing it as unconstitutionally vague and a "chilling effect" on lawful activity and journalism.

Technical and practical aspects were also debated. Some users questioned the enforceability of the policy, noting that small drones under 250g may not be easily tracked and that DJI drones may no longer enforce hard geofencing. Others raised tactical concerns, speculating that the NOTAM could be a pretext for law enforcement to use anti-drone weapons or to retroactively identify and prosecute operators using drone ID signals.

The discussion also highlighted the ambiguity of the rule itself. One user pointed out that the NOTAM applies not just to ICE but to a wide range of federal agencies (DOD, DOE, DHS), making it even broader in scope. The practical difficulty for drone operators to identify "mobile assets" on the fly was noted as a significant flaw, potentially leading to unintentional violations. The overall sentiment is one of skepticism and alarm, with many commenters hoping the policy will be challenged and struck down in court.

## [Iran's internet blackout may become permanent, with access for elites only](https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-blackout-tiered-internet/)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 173 | **ID:** 46761822

> **Article:** The article from Rest of World explores the possibility of Iran's recent internet blackouts becoming a permanent, tiered system. This system would provide a heavily censored, domestic "intranet" for the general population while granting elites and government officials access to the global internet. The piece details the technical measures being implemented, such as deep packet inspection and IP blocking, which make circumvention via VPNs increasingly difficult. It contrasts Iran's approach with China's "Great Firewall," noting that while Iran's economy is already struggling, the regime appears willing to sacrifice economic prosperity for political control and stability, using North Korea as a potential model for a fully isolated digital existence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around several key themes: the global trend of internet censorship, the technical feasibility and economic consequences of a total blackout, and the effectiveness of circumvention methods.

Many commenters contextualized Iran's actions within a broader global pattern, arguing that Western democracies are also implementing their own forms of censorship. Examples cited included EU blocks on Russian sites, Spain's internet shutdowns during football matches, and the UK's age-verification laws. This led to a debate about whether such measures are comparable, with some users feeling that HN commenters are not sufficiently concerned about censorship in their own countries.

The economic viability of a permanent blackout was a major point of contention. Some argued that it would be an economic "death sentence" for a country like Iran, which is already in a poor economic state. However, others countered that authoritarian regimes often prioritize power over economic prosperity, pointing to North Korea as a model for how a country can survive and maintain control even under extreme isolation and poverty.

Technically, the discussion focused on the cat-and-mouse game between censors and users. An Iranian user provided firsthand insight, explaining that during blackouts, all internet access is throttled and blocked, making VPNs nearly impossible to use. They described a government strategy of constantly patching workarounds as they are discovered. The conversation also touched on the effectiveness of jamming satellite internet services like Starlink, with some users suggesting it's a solvable technical challenge for a determined state. Finally, there was speculation about the existence of uncensored SIM cards for elites and the potential for foreign intelligence agencies to exploit the whitelisted systems.

## [Show HN: Bonsplit – Tabs and splits for native macOS apps](https://bonsplit.alasdairmonk.com)
**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 32 | **ID:** 46753301

> **Project:** Bonsplit is a native macOS library for developers that adds tabbed and split-pane interfaces to applications built with AppKit and SwiftUI. It provides a polished, high-fidelity UI component set for creating complex window layouts within a single window, similar to the "Origami" mode in Sublime Text or tiling window managers. The project is accompanied by a highly elaborate and visually impressive website that serves as its documentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The community's reaction was largely positive, with significant praise for the library's visual polish and the quality of its documentation website. However, the discussion revealed some initial confusion about the project's scope. Several commenters mistakenly assumed it was a system-wide utility that would add tabs and splits to all native macOS applications, rather than a library for developers to integrate into their own apps. Once clarified, developers appreciated the library's utility, particularly for applications with complex UIs like IDEs, where native window-level tabs might not be sufficient.

Key technical points included a question about the necessity of the library, given that AppKit already provides a native tabbing API. This prompted a clarification that Bonsplit operates at the window content level, offering more granular control than the system's window-level tabs. The project's creator was also commended for the difficult work of getting drag-and-drop interactions right. A notable side thread was the intense admiration for the project's website, with commenters viewing its high-quality design as a statement on how software documentation should be presented.

**Score:** 229 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46760237

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Clawdbot," an open-source personal AI assistant designed to run locally (e.g., on a Mac Mini) and interact with a user's desktop and applications. It utilizes an LLM backend (primarily Claude) to perform tasks such as organizing notes, building small apps, and managing communications via platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram. The project is positioned as a "safety gloves off" tool, granting broad system access to function as a true autonomous agent.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community divided between excitement over the potential of local AI agents and frustration with the current state of the technology. The consensus is that while Clawdbot offers a glimpse into a powerful future of personal automation, the implementation is still rough around the edges.

**Usability and Setup**
Many users found the initial setup tedious and buggy, with one user noting that the bot "forgot the context literally seconds later." However, those who persisted through the tinkering phase reported "wow" moments, particularly when the bot successfully automated complex workflows like apartment rental screenings or desktop research.

**Security and Safety**
A significant portion of the debate centers on security. The bot's "safety gloves off" approach—requiring deep system permissions to function—raises concerns about prompt injection and data privacy. Users are wary of handing over control of accounts and messaging apps to a tireless bot that could accidentally cause significant damage, though some argue this is a necessary trade-off for true automation.

**Utility and Value**
Opinions varied on the bot's real-world impact. Some compared it to the "productivity theater" of tools like Notion, questioning if organizing digital clutter actually drives value. Others countered that AI lowers the cost of "busy work," making previously neglected tasks valuable. A distinct use case emerged in coding workflows, with some users preferring established tools like "Vim + aider" or "Claude Code" over Clawdbot's broader, less focused approach.

**Technical Context**
Users noted that the bot's performance is heavily dependent on the underlying LLM model, with Opus 4.5 reportedly outperforming Sonnet on difficult tasks. There was also technical discussion regarding deprecation warnings in the npm dependencies, though other users clarified these were ignorable warnings rather than critical errors.

**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46753708

> **Article:** The article links to "DPaint-js," a web-based image editor created by Steffest that is modeled after the classic Amiga program Deluxe Paint. The project is implemented in vanilla JavaScript and is available on GitHub. It aims to replicate the nostalgic feel and functionality of the original software for modern web browsers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to the project, with commenters praising the clean, readable, and well-structured vanilla JavaScript code. Many appreciated it as a refreshing alternative to complex modern frameworks and enterprise-level codebases. Several users, including demoscene artists, noted the author's talent and shared links to his recent competition entries created with the tool.

The discussion also included technical feedback and comparisons. One user reported a bug with the smudge tool's blending behavior, which the author acknowledged and quickly addressed with an update. A key point of debate arose regarding the tool's faithfulness to the original Deluxe Paint. While some users felt it was a faithful homage, one commenter argued it was disingenuous to claim it was "modeled after" Deluxe Paint because it initially lacked a defining feature: the ability to instantly turn selected pixels into a custom brush. However, another user clarified that this brush functionality is present in the development version, suggesting it's a work in progress. Finally, the conversation branched into mentions of other Deluxe Paint clones, such as the Python-based PyDPainter and the DOS-based VGA Paint 386.

## [Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems](https://www.diljitpr.net/blog-post-postgresql-dlq)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46755115

> **Article:** The article proposes using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for event-driven systems. It details a practical implementation using a dedicated table to store failed messages. The core technical mechanism relies on `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to allow multiple consumer workers to safely process messages in parallel without locking conflicts. The author argues that for many applications, this approach is simpler and more maintainable than introducing a separate, dedicated message queue system, leveraging PostgreSQL's existing durability, queryability, and ease of use.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a divided view, balancing pragmatism against architectural purity and scalability concerns.

A significant portion of the debate centers on whether using a database as a queue is an anti-pattern. Critics argue that databases are not designed for this purpose and that using a b-tree for a queue is inefficient, potentially leading to performance degradation and high costs as the queue grows. They warn of failure scenarios, such as a bug causing a massive influx of dead letters that could overload the database, and suggest that a dedicated queue system is more appropriate for high-scale or critical workloads.

Conversely, many commenters defend the practice as a pragmatic and effective solution for a vast majority of applications. They argue that for low-to-medium volume systems (e.g., thousands of tasks per hour), a PostgreSQL-based queue is perfectly viable and offers significant advantages, including high visibility, easy requeueing, and the ability to dynamically query and adjust task priorities. Several users shared their successful experiences using PostgreSQL (and even MySQL) as a primary queue, emphasizing that it's a reasonable starting point for most business applications that don't operate at extreme scale.

Technical best practices were also a key theme. Commenters highlighted the importance of `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrency, but also noted critical considerations for production use, such as adding a `LIMIT` clause to processing batches, managing table growth with deletion or partitioning, and being aware of how `ANALYZE` can affect query plans on large, append-heavy tables. The open-source `pgmq` extension was mentioned as a robust, pre-built solution that implements these patterns.

Finally, some discussion touched on the role of AI in learning, with one user noting they learned about `SKIP LOCKED` from ChatGPT, and a recurring meta-comment about how articles on this topic frequently appear on the HN homepage.

## [Over 36,500 killed in Iran's deadliest massacre, documents reveal](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601255198)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 136 | **ID:** 46760329

> **Article:** The article from Iran International reports on a newly revealed document detailing a massacre in Iran, allegedly killing over 36,500 people in just two days across 400 cities. The event is described as the regime's response to widespread protests, with victims reportedly executed after being arrested or hospitalized. The scale of the violence is presented as unprecedented, far exceeding death tolls from other notable historical crackdowns like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, focusing on the nature of the violence, the credibility of the source, and the geopolitical implications.

Commenters express shock at the scale of the massacre, questioning the logistics of killing 36,500 people in two days. Some speculate that the regime utilized foreign mercenaries from Afghanistan and Iraq to carry out the killings, citing historical tensions between Iran's various ethnic groups. Others note the grim efficiency of the operation, calculating a relatively low number of deaths per city, suggesting a systematic execution of arrested protesters rather than chaotic battlefield casualties.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the source of the report, *Iran International*. Skeptics point out the outlet is backed by Saudi money and may have a bias against the Iranian regime, with some going as far as to label it a "CIA front." However, other users argue that this specific geopolitical alignment actually lends the report credibility, as Saudi Arabia would benefit from exposing the regime's brutality.

The conversation also broadens to compare the massacre to other global conflicts and human rights issues. Users draw comparisons to the Tiananmen Square massacre and the ongoing war in Gaza, debating the moral distinctions between state-on-state violence versus state-on-citizen violence. There is also criticism directed at Western political groups—specifically the "left" and U.S. college students—for what commenters perceive as a hypocritical silence regarding Iran compared to other geopolitical issues.

Finally, the discussion touches on the efficacy of foreign intervention and sanctions. Some commenters criticize Donald Trump’s previous rhetoric for encouraging protesters without providing support, potentially leading to higher casualties. Others debate whether civil disobedience or sanctions are effective against a regime willing to hire foreign mercenaries and employ extreme violence to maintain power.

> **Article:** A BBC article reports that a Spanish high-speed train derailment, which resulted in fatalities, was caused by a fractured track. An official investigation found a "complete lack of continuity" in the rail, indicating a significant gap. The article notes that several other trains had passed over the damaged section before the disaster occurred, suggesting the failure went undetected by existing monitoring systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the causes of the accident, potential detection methods, and a comparative analysis of rail safety systems. A primary theme was the failure of track monitoring. Commenters detailed how modern railways use specialized measurement trains equipped with cameras and LIDAR (like the UK's New Measurement Train) and regular manual inspections to detect fractures. There was a consensus that the incident points to a significant operational failure, with some suggesting that all trains should be equipped with basic onboard sensors for real-time anomaly detection.

Another major topic was the comparison between European and Japanese rail safety. Users highlighted the spotless safety record of Japan's Shinkansen since the 1960s, contrasting it with two fatal derailments in Spain over the past two decades. This led to speculation about differences in maintenance budgets, operational culture, and the sheer scale of Spain's high-speed network compared to Switzerland's, which was brought up as a model of quality.

Finally, the discussion touched on the technical and systemic aspects of rail infrastructure. Users explained the physics of continuously welded tracks and how tension can affect the appearance of a fracture. The conversation also broadened to include recent rail incidents in Spain, with some commenters suggesting a pattern of neglect, while others noted the country's extensive and largely safe high-speed network. The potential for sabotage was also mentioned in the context of recent European rail disruptions.

## [Scientists identify brain waves that define the limits of 'you'](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-brain-waves-that-define-the-limits-of-you)

> **Article:** A new study published in *Nature Communications* identifies parietal alpha brain waves (8–12 Hz) as a key mechanism in defining the boundaries of the self. Researchers found that the frequency of these waves dictates how the brain integrates sensory signals over time to create a unified sense of body ownership. By using non-invasive transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to artificially speed up or slow down participants' alpha waves, the team was able to directly manipulate this perception, making a fake hand feel more or less "real" depending on the frequency. This establishes a causal link between specific neural oscillations and the fundamental experience of where one's body ends.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focused heavily on the implications of the study's methodology and the philosophical nature of the findings. A prominent theme was the reaction to the use of transcranial stimulation to alter brain waves. Several commenters found humor in the contrast between the profound nature of the experiment—changing a person's sense of self—and the clinical description of the method as "non-invasive," joking that "special operation" might be a more fitting term.

The causal link between brain activity and self-perception was the most significant point of interest. Users noted that the study went beyond mere correlation; by actively changing the alpha wave frequency and observing a corresponding change in subjective experience, the researchers provided strong evidence that these waves act as a "tick rate" or temporal binding window for the body model.

Finally, the conversation branched into philosophical and speculative territory. Commenters debated the nature of the self, with some referencing dualism (the separation of mind and body) while others argued for a process-oriented view where the "soul" is simply a function of the body. There was also speculation on the limits of the body's electric field, with users discussing applications in capacitive sensing and magnetocardiography, as well as the potential for practices like meditation to influence these neural mechanisms.

## [Alarm overload is undermining safety at sea as crews face thousands of alerts](https://www.lr.org/en/knowledge/press-room/press-listing/press-release/2026/alarm-overload-is-undermining-safety-at-sea-as-new-research-shows-crews-face-tens-of-thousands-of-daily-alerts/)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46753611

> **Article:** A new report by Lloyd's Register highlights that alarm overload is undermining safety at sea. Crews on modern ships are facing tens of thousands of alerts daily, leading to "alarm fatigue" where critical warnings are missed amidst the noise. The research indicates that the constant barrage of alerts is so severe that it is reducing crew rest times, as personnel must remain available to service alarms around the clock. The report suggests that while automation was intended to reduce human error, the excessive and often false alerts are creating new risks by desensitizing crews and increasing cognitive load.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's findings, with users drawing parallels to alarm fatigue in other high-stakes industries. A central theme is the "boy who cried wolf" effect, where excessive alerts breed complacency or frustration, rendering safety systems ineffective. This was compared to modern cars with driver-assistance features that beep incessantly, particularly in adverse weather, causing distraction or leading drivers to disable the systems entirely.

Commenters highlighted the severe consequences of alarm overload in aviation and nuclear power. Specific examples included Air France Flight 447, where a critical stall warning was obscured by a flood of other alerts, and the Three Mile Island accident, where operators were overwhelmed by alarms during the meltdown. In IT infrastructure, the "alert storms" caused by a single root failure (like a database crash) were cited as a similar problem requiring better deduplication and dependency rules.

The conversation also touched on the psychology of safety design. One user shared an anecdote from manufacturing where removing confirmation dialogs actually reduced incident rates, suggesting that over-guarding can lead to user inattention. Conversely, others noted that in medical devices, the tension between regulatory liability and user experience often results in "defensive" alarm design that prioritizes covering the manufacturer over the operator's clarity. The consensus was that current alarm systems are often poorly designed, prioritizing quantity of data over actionable intelligence.

## [ICE tells legal observer, 'We have a database, now you're a domestic terrorist'](https://reason.com/2026/01/23/ice-tells-legal-observer-we-have-a-nice-little-database-and-now-youre-considered-a-domestic-terrorist/)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46761130

> **Article:** The article from Reason.com reports that a legal observer was told by an ICE agent that they are now considered a "domestic terrorist" and are in a government database. The incident allegedly occurred while the observer was recording ICE agents in public. The article frames this as part of a broader pattern where the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is treating the act of following and recording federal immigration officers as obstruction of justice or assault. It cites a DHS spokesperson's statement that such actions "sure sounds like obstruction of justice" and warns that those who obstruct or assault law enforcement will be prosecuted.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the government's actions and skeptical of the article's claims. The conversation revolves around several key themes:

*   **Skepticism of the Article's Narrative:** Several users, particularly those with the username "zahlman," express doubt about the Reason.com article's interpretation of events. They argue that the article fails to provide sufficient evidence that the observer was arrested solely for recording and suggests that the observer may have been obstructing law enforcement, which would be a legitimate cause for arrest. This skepticism extends to the veracity of the "unnamed DHS spokesperson" quote.

*   **Concerns Over Government Overreach and Surveillance:** A dominant theme is the fear of a growing surveillance state. Users discuss the existence of government facial recognition databases and the unreliability of such technology. There is a strong sentiment that the term "domestic terrorist" is being weaponized by the state to criminalize political dissent and justify violence against its opponents, drawing parallels to historical events like the "War on Terror" and COINTELPRO.

*   **Criticism of the Tech Industry:** Commenters place blame on the technology sector, noting that engineers and companies built the surveillance tools and databases that enable these government actions. One user suggests that those who built these systems may feel pride in their work rather than shame, highlighting a perceived moral disconnect within the tech industry.

*   **Counter-Arguments and Irony:** In a sub-thread, a user predicts that the government will use collected intelligence to blackmail activists into silence. Another user counters this by pointing out the irony that it is often the ICE agents themselves who wear masks to hide their identities, fearing public repercussions for their actions.
