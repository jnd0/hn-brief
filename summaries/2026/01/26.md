# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-26

## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 893 | **Comments:** 538 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This system aggregates data from various government sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicaid. The report, based on court testimony, suggests that this tool is being used to cross-reference data to locate and target individuals for immigration enforcement, raising significant privacy and civil liberties concerns regarding the use of health data for law enforcement purposes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the reported program, centering on themes of privacy erosion, the dangers of centralized data, and the potential for abuse of power. A primary concern raised by users is the "nothing to hide" fallacy, with commenters arguing that data misuse can have severe consequences, such as enabling stalking or erroneous law enforcement actions based on bad data. There is significant skepticism regarding the legality and accountability of ICE's operations, with some users suggesting that the existence of such powerful surveillance infrastructure makes it difficult for future leaders to dismantle it.

The technical and structural aspects of data collection were also debated. While some questioned the direct link between Medicaid and immigration enforcement, others clarified that certain states provide health coverage to immigrants and that federal laws (like EMTALA) require hospitals to provide emergency care regardless of status, thus creating data trails. A notable theme was the critique of centralized federal databases, with one user arguing for a decentralized approach (citing the 10th Amendment) as a safety feature against bad actors, though others countered that this could lead to inequitable social services in poorer states. The discussion also touched on the role of tech workers, with a call for engineers to quit or "soft quit" jobs that contribute to such surveillance systems.

## [A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 628 | **Comments:** 329 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The linked article from the statistical modeling blog criticizes a highly influential paper in management science that has been cited over 6,000 times. The author argues that the paper contains significant flaws and that its widespread citation is problematic. The core message is a warning against treating single studies as definitive evidence and a call for the academic community to prioritize replication studies to verify findings before building upon them.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expressing widespread cynicism about the reliability of academic research and the systems that reward high citation counts. A central theme is the systemic difficulty in correcting the scientific record. Several users shared personal anecdotes of failed replication attempts, noting that pushing for retractions or corrections can be career-threatening, especially for junior researchers challenging established senior academics. This "don't rock the boat" culture is seen as a major barrier to self-correction.

Commenters also discussed the broader academic incentives that perpetuate this problem. They pointed to the pressure to publish novel, positive results, which makes publishing null findings or straightforward replications difficult. This leads to practices like "citation rings," author count inflation, and the uncritical referencing of flawed but popular papers, as researchers often cite sources without reading them thoroughly.

While some users debated the ethics of labeling researchers as "bad people" versus critiquing the systemic pressures, the overall sentiment was that the academic system is flawed. Proposed solutions included developing "trust" networks to overlay the citation graph and a general consensus that researchers should treat single studies as sources of ideas rather than established facts.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 576 | **Comments:** 284 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The linked website, netzbremse.de, acts as a public portal for a formal complaint filed with the German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). The complaint alleges that Deutsche Telekom (DT) is intentionally violating net neutrality and abusing its market dominance.

The core accusation is that DT deliberately under-dimensions its internet transit capacity, creating artificial bottlenecks. This forces external websites and online services (content providers) to pay for expensive, direct "peering" contracts with DT to ensure their services are accessible at reasonable speeds to DT's customers. Without these paid agreements, traffic is routed through congested paths, resulting in slow loading times and a degraded user experience for DT's subscribers. The complaint argues this practice harms competition and innovation, as it creates a "toll road" for internet access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of technical analysis, personal frustration, and broader cultural commentary about Deutsche Telekom (DT) and the German internet landscape.

A central theme is the widespread user experience of poor performance, particularly with sites using services like Cloudflare, which users report are slow or inaccessible during peak hours. This is linked to DT's alleged refusal to maintain cost-neutral peering agreements. The technical root of the problem is described as intentionally under-provisioned transit points, forcing content providers to become direct customers for decent performance.

Many commenters express frustration with DT's de facto monopoly, especially in new developments where no alternative ISP is available. This leads to discussions about infrastructure policy, with some suggesting Germany should have followed Switzerland's model of open-access infrastructure to foster competition. The situation has pushed some users to seek alternatives like Starlink, despite personal reservations about its owner, due to its superior reliability and speed.

The conversation broadens into a critique of German contradictions: being a technological and economic powerhouse while suffering from bureaucratic inertia and poor digital infrastructure. This is compared to other societal paradoxes, such as a cultural obsession with privacy coexisting with widespread use of insecure or non-repairable technology. The discussion also touches on the irony of protesting net neutrality violations using a YouTube video, highlighting the pragmatic realities of bandwidth costs versus ideological purity.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 467 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Posturr," a macOS application designed to improve user ergonomics. The app uses the computer's camera to monitor the user's posture and automatically blurs the screen when it detects slouching, serving as a real-time visual cue to correct one's position.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the posture-monitoring app was mixed, focusing on several key themes:

*   **Privacy and Trust Concerns:** A primary concern was the security of an open-source, unaudited application that requires camera access. Several users stated they would only consider using it if it were officially notarized by Apple and offered to pay for a more secure, commercial version. Others countered that the app's small codebase (under 1000 lines) is simple enough for a user or an AI to audit themselves.

*   **Technical Implementation and Alternatives:** The discussion touched on the app's technical stack. The author clarified a confusing "Claude Mode" notification, explaining it was an experimental, abandoned attempt to use the Claude AI for posture assessment, which was ultimately too slow and inaccurate. The app now uses a simpler, more effective vision library for head height detection. One commenter suggested using open-source models from Hugging Face as a more capable alternative to proprietary tools.

*   **Practicality and Ergonomics:** Users debated the real-world effectiveness of the app. A key point was that posture is relative to an individual's height and chair/desk setup, leading to questions about how the app establishes a baseline. One humorous comment noted the app could be gamed by simply never sitting up straight in the first place. The conversation broadened to general ergonomics, with users sharing their own "productive" but poor postures and discussing the necessity of external monitors, proper chairs (like the Herman Miller Embody), and laptop stands for achieving good posture.

*   **Humor and Tangents:** The thread included lighthearted comments, such as the app causing "sick eyes" and a suggestion for a similar app to detect when the user isn't wearing their glasses (which was met with the joke that the screen is already blurry in that case).

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 363 | **Comments:** 185 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article, titled "Yes, It's Fascism," argues that the current U.S. administration under President Trump has crossed a threshold into fascism. The author contends that this is not merely a matter of political disagreement but a clear manifestation of authoritarianism characterized by the use of state violence, the erosion of due process, and the consolidation of power. The piece points to the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as a primary example, describing their conduct as reminiscent of historical paramilitary forces like the Nazi "brown shirts." The article asserts that the administration's rhetoric, which quickly labels victims as "terrorists" to justify lethal force, and its systematic targeting of political opponents and specific communities, align with established definitions of fascist regimes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and deeply concerned, with the overwhelming majority of visible comments expressing alarm and agreeing with the article's premise. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **ICE as a Fascist Paramilitary Force:** Many commenters draw direct parallels between ICE and historical fascist groups, such as the Nazi "brown shirts" or "jackboots." They argue that ICE agents are ideologically aligned, poorly trained, and operate with a sense of impunity, leading to what are described as "executions" without due process. The agency's recruitment, which some suggest self-selects for aggression and offers high financial incentives, is seen as a mechanism for building a loyal enforcement arm.

*   **The Nature of the Trump Administration:** There is a debate on whether President Trump is a true ideologue or a vehicle for the fascists around him, like Stephen Miller. However, the consensus is that the administration's actions—such as immediately labeling victims as terrorists to justify violence—demonstrate systemic intent and a complete disregard for the rule of law.

*   **Public and Political Response:** Commenters express shock at the public's apathy or active support for these actions, particularly from Trump's base, who are seen as cheering on the crackdown. There is significant frustration with the Democratic party's response, which is criticized as being too weak, offering superficial reforms like "more training" instead of demanding fundamental accountability, such as "Nuremberg-style trials" for ICE.

*   **Historical Parallels and Future Outlook:** The discussion is steeped in historical comparisons, particularly to 1930s Germany and the Weimar Republic. Many fear that the U.S. is on an irreversible path, questioning whether a peaceful resolution is possible. There is deep pessimism about the future, with fears that the fascist tendencies will become normalized regardless of the 2028 election, and that the Democratic party is failing to offer a meaningful alternative to address the systemic problems.

*   **Semantic Satiation and Skepticism:** A minority of commenters express skepticism, arguing that the term "fascism" has been overused for years, leading to "semantic satiation" where the word has lost its impact. They point to past warnings of fascism that did not culminate in a complete authoritarian takeover as evidence for their desensitization. This view is strongly rebutted by others who see it as a willful ignoring of a clear and escalating pattern.

## [Oneplus phone update introduces hardware anti-rollback](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 350 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** The article reports that OnePlus has introduced a hardware anti-rollback mechanism in a recent phone update. This feature utilizes "eFuses"—one-time programmable bits of memory within the phone's processor—to permanently record the current firmware version. When the phone boots, it checks this stored version against the version of the software being loaded. If the software version is lower than the recorded version, the device will refuse to boot. This effectively prevents users from "downgrading" their phone's software to an older version, even if they are using custom ROMs. The mechanism is designed to be permanent; once a fuse is "blown" to a higher version number, it cannot be undone.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the motivations behind this move, the technical implementation, and the broader implications for user ownership and control over their devices.

A primary theme was the rationale for the change. Commenters offered two main theories: security and theft prevention. One perspective, articulated by jeroenhd and TomatoCo, was that this is a security measure to prevent attackers from downgrading a phone to an older, vulnerable firmware version to exploit it. A related point was that it could be a response to a specific vulnerability that allowed thieves to bypass device lockouts, making stolen phones usable again. This aligns with the idea that manufacturers have a commercial interest in making their devices less appealing to thieves.

However, many users were skeptical of the security-first narrative. They argued that the move serves to lock users into OnePlus's ecosystem, kill the vibrant custom ROM community, and force users to accept potentially undesirable updates. Commenters like hexagonwin suggested that if a future update slows down a phone or introduces bloatware, users will have no recourse but to buy a new device. This ties into a larger philosophical debate about ownership. Several participants, including jacquesm and mystraline, argued that such software-activated "kill switches" undermine the very concept of owning a device. They contended that if a manufacturer can remotely and permanently alter a product's functionality, the user is more of a renter than an owner, a sentiment they extended to other products like modern cars.

Technically, the discussion clarified how the mechanism works. ARob109 provided a detailed explanation of the Qualcomm boot chain, where the Primary Boot Loader checks the eFuse version before loading the eXtensible Boot Loader (XBL). Custom ROMs are affected because they often package firmware components (blobs) from a specific stock firmware version; if a user on a newer, "fused" version tries to flash a custom ROM built against an older firmware, the anti-rollback check will fail. The conversation also compared this hardware-based approach to software-based methods, such as Apple's signature-based downgrade prevention, with some noting that iPhones have long prevented downgrades, though not necessarily via a physical fuse.

Finally, the discussion touched upon the broader context of OnePlus's evolution. Several long-time users expressed disillusionment, viewing this change as another step in the company's transformation from a "flagship killer" that catered to enthusiasts into a more mainstream entity, with some speculating that its identity has been subsumed by its parent company, Oppo.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 344 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named arin-s has ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro earbuds. The project is notable not just for the port itself, but for its accessibility: a web-based interface allows anyone to join a queue and play the game remotely on the earbuds from their own PC. The project's website provides links to the GitHub repositories for those interested in the technical details.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement and technical curiosity, typical for "Doom on a device" posts. The initial comments are lighthearted, with users celebrating the ever-expanding list of unconventional devices that can run the game and referencing the popular "itrunsdoom" subreddit.

The conversation quickly deepens into technical and economic questions. One user inquires about the specific hardware, the PineBuds Pro, with the developer admitting they haven't used them for their intended audio purpose. A separate user asks about the technical feasibility of running Doom on even more constrained hardware, like the microcontrollers found in disposable vapes. This leads to a detailed discussion where another user calculates that the 3KB of RAM in a typical vape MCU is far too small for Doom's 4MB requirement, estimating it would take a decade of hardware miniaturization to become possible.

The most significant thread of discussion revolves around a philosophical question posed by a user: whether porting Doom to complex hardware like earbuds represents a triumph of software efficiency or an economic failure, suggesting that simpler, purpose-built chips should be cheaper. Other users counter this, arguing it's actually a triumph of economic scale. They posit that mass production has made powerful, general-purpose processors so cheap and ubiquitous that they are now the most cost-effective option, even for applications that don't require their full capabilities. This is seen as a natural result of technological progression, where a single modern device can contain more computing power than the entire world did in the 1980s.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 330 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the most crucial principle of effective writing is to immediately engage the reader's interest. The author posits that before you can inform, persuade, or entertain, you must first earn the reader's attention. This is achieved not by burying the lead with context, but by starting with a compelling hook, a fascinating question, or a surprising assertion that creates an immediate desire in the reader to know more. The piece uses the hypothetical opening of a history book about Venice to illustrate how a dry, factual start fails this test, while a narrative or mystery-driven opening would succeed. The core message is a challenge to writers to prioritize the reader's engagement from the very first sentence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis while exploring its nuances and broader implications. A primary point of consensus is that "First, make me care" is a vital principle, but its application depends heavily on the audience. Commenters note that while a general audience needs a narrative hook, a technical audience often prefers to "get straight to the details." This led to a debate about the integrity of writing in the digital age. Some argued that the pressure to create "make me care" hooks for clicks and SEO has led to the decline of in-depth content, with writers burying the lede and failing to provide substantive details.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the modern "attention economy," using TikTok as a prime example. One commenter described the platform as a "brute-force attack on human psychology," where creators must constantly innovate hooks to prevent users from skipping. This sparked a counter-narrative, with some users expressing a deep aversion to this style of content and actively seeking out media that limits choice, like SiriusXM, to force deeper engagement and discovery.

Finally, the conversation offered alternative frameworks for writing. The military's "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) concept was presented as a respectful and efficient communication style that respects the reader's time by stating the point immediately. Another commenter argued that "Just… start with the interesting part first" is a more honest and less manipulative version of the article's advice. The discussion also touched on the role of mystery in storytelling, with a debate on whether it's an engaging hook or an irritating narrative device.

## [Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)
**Score:** 292 | **Comments:** 14 | **ID:** 46751826

> **Article:** The article provides a comprehensive introduction to PostgreSQL indexes, explaining their fundamental purpose of speeding up data retrieval. It covers the core B-Tree index structure, which is the default and most common type, and details how to create and use them effectively. The guide also explores other essential index types like GIN (for full-text search and array operations), GiST (for geometric data and full-text), and BRIN (for large, naturally ordered tables). Key concepts discussed include multi-column indexes, partial indexes (indexing a subset of a table), and the importance of index maintenance for performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive, with users praising the article as an excellent, in-depth introduction to a complex topic. The conversation quickly expands beyond the article itself, focusing on shared resources and specific technical nuances.

A recurring theme is the strong recommendation of the external resource "Use The Index, Luke," which multiple commenters cite as a go-to, essential guide for understanding database indexing in general, not just for PostgreSQL. The official PostgreSQL documentation is also highlighted as being surprisingly well-written and enjoyable to read.

A more technical debate emerges around multi-column indexes. One commenter questions whether the traditional wisdom—that an index is only useful if the query's `WHERE` clause matches the index's column order from left to right—is still entirely accurate. This is countered by another user who points to a recent PostgreSQL development (index skip scan, arriving in version 18) and notes that while earlier versions could use such indexes, it often resulted in inefficient full index scans. A follow-up comment clarifies that a bitmap index scan, while helpful, is still less performant than a proper index scan in this scenario.

Finally, the discussion briefly touches on related database features. One user expresses a desire for built-in incremental view maintenance (automatically updating materialized views), which leads to a mention of the `pg_ivm` extension and other specialized systems like TimescaleDB that offer this functionality.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior local health officials in Iran have claimed the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures, citing a German-Iranian eye doctor as a primary source. The report contrasts this number with lower estimates from other groups, such as the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which had confirmed 5,459 deaths as of the report's publication.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on skepticism regarding the reported death toll and the geopolitical context. A significant portion of commenters express doubt about the 30,000 figure, drawing parallels to historical events like the Dresden bombing to question the scale of the violence and noting the lack of on-the-ground verification. This skepticism is compounded by accusations that the report could be "manufacturing consent" for military intervention, with many users referencing the lead-up to the Iraq War and the unreliability of intelligence in such contexts.

Conversely, other users defend the report's gravity, arguing that the Iranian government's severe internet censorship and refusal to allow observers make it difficult to gather evidence, and that the absence of proof is a result of state control rather than a lack of events. The discussion also branches into technical and political analysis:
*   **Technical Resilience:** A prominent thread discusses the failure of modern technology during internet shutdowns, with one user arguing that developers must build "offline-first" and decentralized tools (like mesh networks) to empower activists, while others counter that this is an impractical requirement for most applications.
*   **Comparative Politics:** Users compare Iran's situation to other nations, such as Bangladesh, to debate whether security forces inherently follow authoritarian orders or can refuse them.
*   **Evidence and Censorship:** Debate exists over the authenticity of leaked videos, with some alleging manipulation and others pointing to the difficulty of getting footage out of the country due to censorship and jamming of communications like Starlink.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 269 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article argues that Palantir, a US-based data analytics and surveillance technology firm, should be excluded from UK public services, particularly within the Ministry of Defence. The author, Zarah Sultana, contends that Palantir's business model is fundamentally incompatible with democratic values and public privacy. The piece highlights the company's controversial origins, its deep ties to intelligence agencies (including the NSA via its "Gotham" platform), and its expansion into civilian sectors like the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The central thesis is that outsourcing critical public infrastructure to a private, foreign corporation with a history of working with authoritarian regimes poses a significant threat to UK sovereignty and civil liberties.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely diverges from the specific UK context to address broader themes of surveillance, big tech influence, and geopolitical alignment. A dominant thread is the pessimistic consensus that mass surveillance is an irreversible reality. Commenters argue that the UK has already accepted a surveillance state, and that replacing Palantir with other US tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google would be a superficial change, as these companies are equally or more dangerous due to their scale and integration into government infrastructure.

The conversation also touches on the perceived rise of an oligarchy, where monied interests and big tech wield more power than the electorate. While some express a cynical view that protesting is now ineffective or illegal, others suggest the solution lies in electing representatives who prioritize public interest over corporate contracts.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the source of the article and its author. One commenter dismisses Zarah Sultana as a "racist conspiracy theorist," linking to sources to question her credibility. This sparked a counter-argument about the reliability of the sources themselves, with another user labeling the opposing source as "Israeli sponsored propaganda," highlighting the polarized nature of discourse around the author.

Finally, there is a pragmatic but critical perspective. One commenter notes that Palantir is successful precisely because it provides services that governments actively want, such as data integration for defense and security. This view suggests that simply banning one company is naive, as the underlying government demand for such powerful tools will persist, and other large consulting firms or tech companies would readily fill the void. The discussion concludes with a call for digital sovereignty, advocating for European alternatives to US big tech in public services.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 93 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The article reports that the White House posted an altered arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and ICE protester, to make it appear she was sobbing. The article notes that the White House deputy communications director admitted to the alteration, stating "the memes will continue," and that other officials mocked fact-checkers who debunked the image. The incident is presented as a rapid and unapologetic adoption of generative AI for political propaganda.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely condemns the White House's actions, viewing them as a dangerous escalation in the use of AI for political manipulation and a further erosion of public trust. Commenters express alarm that the government is openly using altered media to spread propaganda, with many noting the speed at which this technology has been weaponized. A recurring theme is the concept of a "post-truth" political environment, where the goal is not to present a false narrative as truth, but to muddy the waters so thoroughly that the concept of objective truth becomes meaningless, thereby discouraging people from questioning their preconceptions.

There is significant debate regarding the real-world impact of such actions. While some argue that this behavior destroys the administration's credibility, others counter that the core voter base is largely indifferent to factual accuracy or actively supports the aggressive tactics. The discussion also touches on potential legal consequences, with commenters speculating about libel and slander lawsuits, though many are pessimistic about the outcome, suggesting the Supreme Court might grant immunity or that a fair trial would be impossible.

Beyond the immediate incident, the conversation broadens to a critique of generative AI's societal impact, with one user describing it as a net negative for society despite its technical achievements. The discussion concludes with some users expressing deep concern for the state of American democracy, while others offer a historical perspective, suggesting that social instability and the rise of far-right movements are often linked to economic inequality and a lack of robust social safety nets.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 176 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operations. Unlike traditional temporary flight restrictions, these zones are mobile, moving with DHS assets like convoys and vessels, and do not provide specific geographic coordinates or activation times. The restriction creates a 3000-foot lateral and 1000-foot vertical buffer around these assets, meaning a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if a DHS convoy passes nearby.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the new policy, with commenters viewing it as a tool for government overreach and a violation of civil liberties. The dominant themes are concerns about authoritarianism, the unenforceability of vague laws, and the practical implications for drone operators.

Many commenters argue that the policy is intentionally vague to create a "chilling effect" and make it impossible for citizens to avoid breaking the law. They draw parallels to dystopian literature like *1984* and *Catch-22*, suggesting the government is creating a legal trap where any drone operator near a DHS operation can be retroactively penalized. The lack of public notification or defined boundaries is seen as a hallmark of authoritarianism, turning a tool for public oversight into a weapon against it.

There is significant discussion about the technical feasibility of enforcement. Some users question how operators are supposed to identify "mobile assets" like unmarked vehicles, while others debate whether drone manufacturers like DJI enforce geofencing or if it can be disabled. The practicality of the rule is challenged by the existence of sub-250g drones that may not be easily tracked and the possibility of building custom drones without identification beacons.

The conversation also touches on the broader scope of the policy, which extends beyond ICE to all DHS and Department of Energy (DOE) mobile assets. This raises questions about the definition of an "asset" and the potential for accidental violations, such as a private drone flying near a rental car carrying DOE personnel. Ultimately, the consensus is that the policy is legally dubious and likely to face constitutional challenges for being overly vague and arbitrary.

## [Second Win11 emergency out of band update to address disastrous Patch Tuesday](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-second-emergency-out-of-band-update-kb5078127-released-address-outlook-bugs)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46750358

> **Article:** Microsoft released a second emergency "out-of-band" update (KB5078127) for Windows 11 to fix critical bugs introduced in the previous Patch Tuesday. The primary issue addressed was a bug in the Outlook desktop client that prevented users from connecting to Exchange Online, though the update also resolved other unspecified bugs. This rare move highlights the severity of the initial update's flaws, which significantly disrupted user workflows.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Microsoft's current approach to Windows development, using the emergency update as a springboard to voice broader frustrations. A central theme is the perceived decline in Windows quality, with users complaining about sluggish performance, bloat, and instability. Several commenters specifically blame the use of web technologies like React within the core Windows Shell (such as the Start Menu) for this sluggishness, noting that even fresh installations on modern hardware can feel slow.

Many users expressed a desire to leave the Windows ecosystem, with some actively migrating to Linux distributions like Fedora or Debian, praising them for being more respectful of hardware and efficient. Others are holding out for the end of Windows 10 support, preferring its stability. The conversation also turned to Microsoft's development culture, with commenters deriding the company's reliance on "AI slop" and "vibe coding" (likely referencing GitHub Copilot), suggesting this is a root cause of the low-quality patches. Specific user pain points mentioned include broken Start Menu search functionality and general OS lag, reinforcing the sentiment that Windows 11 is a step backward in quality and user experience.

## [Show HN: Bonsplit – Tabs and splits for native macOS apps](https://bonsplit.alasdairmonk.com)
**Score:** 206 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46753301

> **Project:** Bonsplit is a developer library for native macOS applications that adds tabbed and split-view window management capabilities. The project provides a way for developers to integrate a "Sublime Text-like" origami mode for window splitting and tabbing directly into their AppKit or SwiftUI apps. The library is accompanied by a highly polished and visually impressive website that serves as its documentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to Bonsplit was largely positive, with commenters praising the library's aesthetic polish and the quality of its website. However, the discussion revealed some initial confusion about the project's scope. Several users mistakenly believed it was a system-wide utility that would add tabs to all existing macOS apps, rather than a library for developers to implement in their own applications.

Technical discussion centered on the library's necessity. One user questioned why it was needed, pointing out that AppKit already provides a native, albeit complex, tabbing API at the window level. The key distinction clarified in the thread is that Bonsplit operates at a more granular level, enabling splits and tabs *within* a single window, similar to the "origami mode" in the Sublime Text editor. While the project was praised for its beauty and attention to detail, one user noted a missing feature for their use case: the ability to tear off and reattach tabs.

**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46750425

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in NVIDIA's open-gpu-kernel-modules repository where users report that `nvidia-smi` and GPU jobs hang indefinitely after approximately 66 days and 12 hours of system uptime. The problem appears to be specific to B200 GPUs using NVLink, with users noting `postRxDetLinkMask` errors immediately preceding the hang. A potential workaround of using a single GPU was suggested but not fully tested. The timing strongly suggests an integer overflow in a 32-bit counter related to time tracking, as 66.6 days is close to 2^32 milliseconds (about 49.7 days) or other powers of two when scaled by different time units.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on diagnosing the root cause of the 66-day hang, with the consensus pointing toward a classic integer overflow bug. Users speculated that a 32-bit counter, likely tracking time in milliseconds or a similar unit, was overflowing after approximately 66 days, causing the driver to hang. The specific error logs mentioning NVLink were seen as a clue pointing to the subsystem responsible.

Beyond the technical speculation, the conversation evolved into a broader sharing of debugging war stories involving long-running time-based bugs. Several users shared personal experiences with similar issues, such as a Raspberry Pi USB stack failing after a week due to a kernel bug, and a National Instruments driver failing precisely every 31 days due to a Windows timer overflow. These anecdotes highlighted the immense difficulty in debugging such issues, especially when the failure period is long, making it hard to iterate on fixes quickly. The shared sentiment was that overcoming these challenging, time-based bugs is a significant learning experience that forces engineers to develop creative, multi-layered workarounds.

Other tangential but notable points included:
*   A user pointing out the importance of using kernel macros like `time_before()` to handle timestamp comparisons correctly across counter overflows.
*   A humorous observation that the bug's 66.6-day duration was "almost diabolical."
*   A meta-discussion about the use of AI-generated comments in issue threads, with one user admitting to using an AI to summarize their thoughts and expressing regret after being called out.
*   A user humorously noted that an internal NVIDIA bug tracking number for the issue seemed to match the number of seconds in the failure period, though this was likely a coincidence.

## [The '3.5% rule': How a small minority can change the world (2019)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46758450

> **Article:** The article, based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, posits the "3.5% rule": the idea that no government has withstood a challenge when 3.5% of its population actively participates in non-violent mass protests. The article argues that such movements are successful because they are inclusive, diverse, and difficult for a state to repress without alienating the broader population and its own security forces. It contrasts this with violent movements, which tend to be more exclusive and have lower success rates.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the 3.5% rule, primarily citing recent counterexamples where large-scale protests have failed to achieve their goals. A central theme is that the political landscape has evolved, with modern authoritarian regimes developing more sophisticated methods of control that render the rule less applicable.

Key points of contention and analysis include:
*   **Recent Failures:** Multiple commenters point to recent protests in Israel, Iran, Hong Kong, and Serbia as evidence that surpassing the 3.5% threshold is no longer a guarantee of success. One user notes that Iran's regime successfully suppressed protests despite significant participation.
*   **Authoritarian Adaptation:** Users argue that governments have learned to counter mass movements. Tactics mentioned include overwhelming, non-lethal repression (e.g., Iran mobilizing ~1% of the population to crush dissent), co-opting protest messages, and dismissing opposition as illegitimate (e.g., labeling protesters as "paid actors" or "rioters").
*   **Nuance of the Original Research:** A user provides a crucial clarification, stating that Chenoweth herself has clarified the 3.5% figure as a descriptive statistic from historical data, not a prescriptive guarantee. The success of a movement depends on broader factors like building a wide public constituency and elite defection, not just hitting a participation number.
*   **The Importance of Non-Violence:** One commenter defends the rule's underlying principle, arguing that non-violent movements are more effective because they can garner wider public support, and state violence against them can backfire by generating sympathy.
*   **Opposing Factions:** A counterpoint is raised that the rule is meaningless if there are multiple, opposing groups (each over 3.5%), as at least one must fail.
*   **Individual vs. Collective Action:** The discussion briefly touches on whether individuals, rather than mass movements, can change the world, with one user arguing that assassinations are rare and counterproductive to the goal of demonstrating collective popular power.

## [Using PostgreSQL as a Dead Letter Queue for Event-Driven Systems](https://www.diljitpr.net/blog-post-postgresql-dlq)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46755115

> **Article:** The article proposes using a PostgreSQL table as a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for event-driven systems that fail to process messages. It outlines a practical implementation using standard SQL features, specifically `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. This locking mechanism allows multiple consumer workers to safely pull from the queue in parallel without locking the entire table, preventing race conditions. The author presents this as a simple, durable, and highly visible solution, leveraging existing database infrastructure rather than introducing complex external dependencies like RabbitMQ or Kafka for error handling.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a pragmatic split between the "Postgres is enough" camp and the "use the right tool" camp, with a heavy emphasis on implementation details.

The core debate centers on scalability and architectural fit. Several users argue that while this approach is fine for low-volume systems (under hundreds of millions of events/day), it is dangerous for high-scale environments. Critics warn that Postgres is fundamentally a B-tree structure, not a queue, and that using it as such can lead to performance bottlenecks and bloat as the queue grows. Conversely, proponents (including users from companies like Segment) argue that Postgres is a perfectly viable persistence layer for queues, offering high visibility, easy reordering, and simplified local development, making it an ideal default for the vast majority of business applications.

There is also a significant focus on technical pitfalls and best practices. The top-voted comment warns that a spike in failures could overwhelm the DLQ and crash the database, suggesting the need for circuit breakers. Regarding the specific `SKIP LOCKED` implementation, users offered advice on ensuring efficiency, such as using `LIMIT` clauses, managing `ORDER BY` for fairness, and monitoring `ANALYZE` statistics to avoid poor query plans. Finally, some users noted the irony of the "just use Postgres" trend, while others pointed to existing open-source tools like `pgmq` that already implement these patterns robustly.

## [Alex Honnold completes Taipei 101 skyscraper climb without ropes or safety net](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/taiwan-alex-honnold-climb-taipei-101-01-25-26-intl-hnk)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 128 | **ID:** 46750470

> **Article:** Alex Honnold, the renowned rock climber, successfully free-soloed Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest skyscrapers, without ropes or safety equipment. The event was broadcast live on Netflix, drawing significant attention to the feat and to Taiwan.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction was a mix of awe for the physical achievement and debate over its purpose and safety. Many commenters described the climb as an incredible and riveting spectacle, comparing it to other historic feats of daring like Felix Baumgartner's space jump. Several users who watched the event live shared their personal experiences, noting the palpable excitement of the crowd at the base of the tower.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on Honnold's motivations. While some speculated it was purely for the adrenaline and personal challenge, others pointed to the financial aspect, noting that his unique skillset is his profession and a way to provide for his family. The role of publicity was also debated, with some viewing it as a selfish risk, while others, particularly those in Taiwan, saw it as a valuable promotion for the country.

Technical aspects and comparisons were also raised. Some users contrasted this climb with Honnold's more technically difficult free-solo of El Capitan, suggesting Taipei 101 might have been less risky despite the urban environment. Others discussed the nature of the climb itself, differentiating it from technical ascents of other skyscrapers that require specialized equipment for smooth surfaces.

Finally, the ethics of the act were questioned, with some commenters deeming it irresponsible for a parent. However, this was countered by a perspective from Honnold himself, who argued that free-soloing at a high level is safer than it appears and that most accidents in the sport happen during easier climbs or other activities like base jumping.
