## [Vietnam bans unskippable ads](https://saigoneer.com/vietnam-news/28652-vienam-bans-unskippable-ads,-requires-skip-button-to-appear-after-5-seconds)
**Score:** 1495 | **Comments:** 764 | **ID:** 46514677

> **Article:** Vietnam's Ministry of Information and Communications has issued a new regulation banning unskippable video ads on online platforms. The rule requires that a "skip" button must appear after no more than five seconds of an ad playing. The regulation also mandates that ads must be clearly labeled and that user data cannot be collected without consent. The move is aimed at improving user experience and protecting consumers from intrusive advertising practices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Vietnam's new ad regulation is multifaceted, with users debating its practical effects, underlying motivations, and the broader role of advertising in the digital economy.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the likely economic and behavioral responses from platforms like YouTube. Several commenters predict that to compensate for the new rule, platforms will simply increase the frequency of ads, showing more, shorter ads per session. One user noted that this might not be a negative for platforms like Google, as a user clicking "skip" provides a strong signal that a real person watched the ad, which is valuable data. This leads to speculation that the regulation could inadvertently create a "Burma Shave" effect, where a series of short ads are shown in succession.

The discussion also broadens into a philosophical critique of the ad-supported business model. A prominent thread argues that the world would be better without ads, which were described as "poisonous" for creating insecurity to drive consumption. This model was linked to the "addictive" nature of social media services. However, others pointed to existing solutions like YouTube Premium as a viable, ad-free alternative for those willing to pay, though one user noted they felt the poor quality of YouTube's ads was itself a tactic to push users toward a subscription.

On the regulation itself, opinions were mixed. While some users supported the principle of limiting intrusive ads, there was skepticism about whether this was a well-thought-out policy. One commenter argued it was a poor regulatory move, while another expressed a wish that ad companies would adopt this rule voluntarily, believing that a good product should be able to make its case in five seconds.

Finally, there was some discussion about the political context of Vietnam, with one user noting that such a consumer-friendly regulation is surprising from a country with low press freedom, and another downplaying the likelihood of it causing a spike in VPN usage.

## [Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far](https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/opus-4-5-change-everything/)
**Score:** 705 | **Comments:** 1022 | **ID:** 46515696

> **Article:** The article, "Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience," argues that Anthropic's Opus 4.5 represents a significant leap in AI coding capabilities. The author, Burke Holland, contrasts it with previous experiences where AI agents would get stuck or fail. With Opus 4.5, he found it could independently tackle complex, multi-step problems like building a macOS app from scratch, reverse-engineering APIs, and iterating through failures without constant human intervention. Holland describes the experience as a shift from "coding" to "guiding," where his role became more about product management and direction than hands-on implementation. He concludes that this level of autonomy fundamentally changes the leverage a single developer can have, enabling the creation of highly personalized software that would have previously been impractical.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a nuanced debate on the practical implications of advanced AI coding agents like Opus 4.5. A central theme is the tension between the incredible productivity gains and the quality/maintainability of the generated code. Several users caution that while these agents can produce functional MVPs, they often create over-engineered, insecure, and difficult-to-maintain solutions that are far from production-ready. However, others counter that this is a natural evolution and that the role of a developer is shifting from writing code to managing and guiding these powerful agents.

There is a strong consensus that these tools dramatically increase developer leverage. The discussion explores how this will impact the software industry, with some predicting an explosion of "slop apps" and others seeing it as a way for skilled developers to outperform entire teams by eliminating coordination costs. A recurring point is that the developer's value will increasingly lie in their ability to define problems, guide the AI, and handle the complex, low-level issues the agents cannot. The conversation also touches on the difficulty of creating reliable benchmarks for AI performance and the practical challenges of managing multiple agents, such as port collisions. Overall, the sentiment is a mix of excitement for the new capabilities and sober skepticism about the readiness of the generated code for complex, real-world environments.

## [Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding: Build via the terminal from your phone](https://github.com/rberg27/doom-coding)
**Score:** 518 | **Comments:** 360 | **ID:** 46517458

> **Article:** The article, "Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding," introduces a project called `doom-coding` that enables developers to build software via a terminal on their smartphone. The core idea is to leverage a phone's terminal app to SSH into a remote development environment, which is made accessible and secure through a VPN like Tailscale. The project provides a setup script to configure a remote server (like a cheap VPS or even a Raspberry Pi) with necessary tools, allowing the user to code and compile from their phone by connecting to this remote machine. The author positions this as a way to turn idle time, such as commuting, into productive coding sessions, contrasting it with "doom scrolling."
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was largely positive and practical, with commenters engaging with the idea's feasibility and offering improvements. The project was praised for its cleverness and for being a novel solution for those who already use tools like Tailscale and Claude AI.

Key points of discussion included:
*   **Practicality and Use Cases:** Many users found the concept relatable, sharing personal anecdotes of coding on phones out of necessity or during commutes. The idea of using `tmux` to maintain a persistent session between a phone and a laptop was a popular and frequently mentioned enhancement.
*   **Tooling and Workflow:** A significant portion of the conversation focused on the technical details of coding in a terminal on a small screen. Commenters discussed solutions for code review, suggesting `git diff`, `bat` for syntax highlighting, or Vim's diff mode as alternatives to a full IDE. The challenge of scrolling within `tmux` on mobile was also raised, with users recommending specific terminal apps like Blink to mitigate the issue.
*   **Security:** A user raised a valid security concern about the demo screenshots potentially exposing sensitive identifiers. The author responded promptly, acknowledging the oversight and confirming they had rebuilt their network as a precaution.
*   **Productivity Debate:** A more philosophical counterpoint was raised, questioning the productivity of coding on a phone. This user argued that such "in-between" moments are better used for rest or exercise, and that the phone's interface is too cumbersome for complex coding and review tasks. However, others countered that for incremental changes and specific use cases, it can be a highly effective way to make progress on projects.

## [Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?](https://akr.am/blog/posts/why-is-the-gmail-app-700-mb)
**Score:** 417 | **Comments:** 365 | **ID:** 46514692

> **Article:** The article, titled "Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?", poses the central question of why a seemingly simple email client requires such a large amount of storage space on iOS (around 700-800 MB). It contrasts this with the native Apple Mail app, which is significantly smaller. The author speculates that the primary reason is that Google apps on iOS must ship with their own large runtimes and libraries (like those for UI, networking, etc.) to ensure cross-platform consistency. This is in contrast to Apple's own apps, which can leverage smaller, pre-existing frameworks built directly into the operating system. The article also notes that other Google apps like Docs and Sheets exhibit similar bloat, and that the problem isn't unique to Gmail, with some other apps like Tesla and Crypto.com being even larger.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees that the article fails to answer its own question, with top comments expressing disappointment at the lack of technical depth. The community then proceeds to offer its own theories, which can be grouped into several key themes.

A prominent explanation, offered by multiple users, is **platform bloat due to cross-platform development**. The theory is that to maintain consistency across iOS and Android, Google bundles its own large frameworks and runtimes (such as for UI components) within each app, rather than relying on smaller, native iOS libraries. This is contrasted with Apple's own apps, which are smaller because they are built using system-level frameworks that don't count against the app's size. A related point is that Apple's first-party apps can also hide necessary components in system-level frameworks, making their on-device footprint appear smaller.

Another major theme is **dependency and feature creep**. Users speculate that the app has accumulated a decade's worth of features, third-party SDKs, and assets. One commenter, claiming to have experience with large apps, argued that 99% of the bloat is "garbage" from old, unused libraries, tracking frameworks, and heavy assets added by designers and managers over the years, which no one has time to remove.

Several users pointed to **specific, large components** that might be included, such as code for other Google services (Meet, Chat), Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation overhead to speed up launch times, and assets for various screen resolutions. The idea of bundled AI models was also mentioned.

Finally, some comments offered more speculative or dismissive theories, such as a conspiracy to push users toward cloud subscriptions or the need for extensive security code, which other users quickly challenged. A common point of clarification was the distinction between disk size (the article's topic) and RAM usage.

## [Volkswagen Brings Back Physical Buttons](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a69916699/volkswagen-interior-physical-buttons-return/)
**Score:** 363 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46514913

> **Article:** Volkswagen is reversing its trend of minimalist, screen-dominated interiors and is bringing back physical buttons and knobs for critical functions. According to a Car and Driver article, the company's new models will feature dedicated controls for volume, defrost, and fan speed in response to customer feedback. This move is a direct acknowledgment that drivers find touchscreens distracting and less intuitive for essential, tactile operations while driving. The goal is to improve usability and safety by providing controls that can be operated by feel without taking one's eyes off the road.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed Volkswagen's decision, viewing it as a necessary correction to a dangerous industry-wide trend of prioritizing aesthetics and cost-cutting over driver safety and usability. The consensus is that physical buttons and knobs are superior for in-car controls because they are tactile and can be used without visual confirmation, which is crucial for minimizing distraction while driving.

Several key themes emerged from the discussion:

*   **Safety and Distraction:** The primary argument in favor of physical buttons is safety. Commenters argued that forcing drivers to navigate touchscreens for essential functions like climate control or defrosting is a "needless distraction" that can be dangerous, especially in urgent situations.
*   **Critique of the "Tesla Effect":** Many users believe that other automakers blindly copied Tesla's button-less interior design without understanding the rationale. One commenter suggested Tesla's approach was tied to a future vision of full self-driving, making physical controls less relevant—a vision not yet realized by most manufacturers. Others felt the trend was driven purely by cost savings and aesthetics, not by any proven safety or usability benefit.
*   **Nuance and Potential Pitfalls:** Not all button layouts are created equal. One user shared a negative experience with a Toyota that had a confusing cluster of buttons requiring repeated presses and visual feedback on an LCD, demonstrating that a poorly designed physical interface can be just as bad as a touchscreen.
*   **Broader Industry Criticism:** The conversation expanded to include other automotive trends. Commenters expressed a desire for VW to also bring back smaller cars to the North American market and manual transmissions. There was also a specific call for Tesla to reintroduce physical gear shifters and turn signal stalks.
*   **Skepticism and Forgiveness:** While praising the move, some commenters remained cynical, pointing to Volkswagen's past (the diesel emissions scandal) as a reason not to fully trust the company.

## [Calling All Hackers: How money works (2024)](https://phrack.org/issues/71/17)
**Score:** 308 | **Comments:** 191 | **ID:** 46518129

> **Article:** The article "Calling All Hackers: How money works" is a primer on finance and economics written for a technical audience. It frames financial systems as complex systems or "computers" that hackers can learn to understand and optimize. The author covers fundamental concepts like the time value of money, interest, inflation, and debt. It then moves into more complex topics relevant to the target audience, such as venture capital, startup equity, and the economic incentives that drive the tech industry. A central theme is the idea that understanding these systems is a form of leverage, and the piece concludes with a philosophical reflection on the trade-offs between pursuing wealth and finding personal fulfillment, especially in one's twenties.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was polarized, with users falling into camps of appreciation and sharp criticism. A significant portion of the commentary focused on the article's technical accuracy. Critics argued that the author oversimplified or made errors in explaining financial mechanics, such as fractional reserve banking, liabilities, and interest, suggesting the piece lacked the rigor expected by a community that values precision. This led to a debate on whether a high-level conceptual explanation is sufficient or if it's misleading without precise details.

Another major theme was the article's philosophical take on career and life choices, specifically the lament of founders "wasting their twenties." This sparked a broader conversation about work-life balance. Commenters debated whether this feeling is unique to entrepreneurs or is a universal experience for people in their twenties, regardless of their profession. The discussion highlighted the privilege of even having a choice between a demanding startup career and a more balanced corporate job, noting that many people work long hours for low pay without the potential for a large financial upside.

Despite the critiques, many users praised the article for its framing and accessibility, agreeing with the author's premise that financial systems are something technical people should learn to navigate. The original author participated in the thread, which was met with positive reinforcement from some members, while others remained skeptical of the article's depth and potential biases.

## [A 30B Qwen model walks into a Raspberry Pi and runs in real time](https://byteshape.com/blogs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/)
**Score:** 299 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46518573

> **Article:** The article from byteshape.com demonstrates that a heavily quantized version of the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 model can run in "real time" on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of RAM. Specifically, the Q3_K_S quantization (at 2.70 bits-per-weight) achieves a throughput of approximately 8 tokens per second while retaining 94% of the original BF16 model's performance across key benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU, IFEVAL, LiveCodeBench). The article highlights the efficiency of this model, which uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture where only 3 billion of its 30 billion parameters are active at any given time, making it feasible to run on low-power, consumer-grade hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical implications of running such a capable model on a Raspberry Pi, with users exploring the technical details, potential applications, and replication challenges.

A primary point of clarification was the definition of "real time" and the model's performance metrics. Users confirmed the 8 tokens-per-second figure and clarified that the reported 94% accuracy is relative to the full BF16 model, measured across a composite of standard benchmarks. There was also a distinction made that the "30B" label refers to the total parameter count, but due to its Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, only 3B parameters are active at once, which is key to its performance on limited hardware.

The discussion then pivoted to a significant user desire: a fully local, private, and interoperable smart home ecosystem. One user outlined a detailed vision for a modular system with separate interactive devices, a home "cloud" server, and dedicated inference engines, expressing frustration with the current lack of a simple, plug-and-play solution. Others agreed, mentioning projects like Home Assistant's Voice Preview Edition as a step in that direction, but noting the stack is still not seamless.

Technical hurdles and alternative approaches were also a major theme. One user reported difficulties replicating the results due to memory allocation errors with `llama.cpp`, which was resolved by manually reducing the context size. This sparked a conversation about other potential optimizations, including different `llama.cpp` forks (like `ik_llama.cpp`), Microsoft's BitNet, and the general need for dedicated inference hardware (NPUs/TPUs) on consumer devices. Finally, users debated the model's overall utility, with some suggesting other models like GPT-OSS-20B as alternatives, while others praised the Qwen model's surprising quality for its size.

**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46514282

> **Article:** The "State of the Fin" post is a progress report from the Jellyfin team, an open-source media server. It focuses on the recent, challenging 10.11.0 release, which introduced a major database migration. The team details the post-release efforts, including four point releases that have addressed over 100 issues to resolve stability and performance problems. The post also highlights progress on client applications, specifically mentioning the Samsung TV client is in review and the new Swiftfin app for tvOS (Apple TV). It concludes by emphasizing the project's reliance on volunteer contributions and encourages community involvement in development, testing, and donations.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive towards Jellyfin, with many users citing their migration from Plex as a direct result of Plex's recent pricing changes and strategic shifts. A recurring theme is that Plex has misjudged its market by pivoting from a personal media server to a streaming service, alienating its original user base. This has served as a catalyst for users to discover and embrace the open-source alternative.

Several users shared their personal journeys, which often started with switching to Jellyfin and then spiraled into building out entire homelabs, incorporating tools like Navidrome for music, reverse proxies (Caddy), and self-hosted cloud storage (OCIS). While Plex is often praised for its polished client software and ease of use, the community is actively closing the gap. Key discussion points include:

*   **Client App Gaps:** The lack of a native Samsung TV client is a major pain point, though progress is being made. For Apple TV, users point to the new official Swiftfin app and the popular third-party Infuse client as viable solutions.
*   **Upgrade Friction:** Some users are still hesitant to upgrade to the 10.11.x series due to reported performance and database locking issues, though others note that recent point releases have resolved many of these problems.
*   **Ecosystem and Workflow:** Users are integrating Jellyfin into broader self-hosted ecosystems, recommending tools like Jellyseerr for request management and Moonfin for downloads.
*   **Motivation for Switching:** The sentiment is clear: users feel Plex is no longer serving their interests, while Jellyfin offers a path to regain control over their media and infrastructure. For many, the switch has been a rewarding, if technically demanding, experience.

## [Firefox extension to redirect x.com to xcancel.com](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toxcancel/)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46524873

> **Article:** The article links to a Firefox browser extension called "toxcancel" available on the Mozilla Add-ons store. Its sole function is to automatically redirect any `x.com` (formerly Twitter) URLs to `xcancel.com`, which is an alternative frontend designed to provide a cleaner, ad-free, and tracker-free user experience without requiring a login.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to the extension, primarily because it supports Firefox, which many users feel is neglected in favor of Chrome. The discussion highlights several key themes:

Users broadly support the concept of alternative frontends like XCancel and Nitter to escape the poor user experience and tracking of the original services. There is a shared sentiment of frustration with the "surveillance state" of mainstream social media, and these tools are seen as a necessary way to cope with the reality that interesting content and links still reside on those platforms.

Several users offered alternative methods to achieve the same goal without installing a dedicated extension. These included a one-line JavaScript bookmarklet, a Tampermonkey userscript, and the more comprehensive "LibRedirect" extension, which handles multiple services (including Instagram). A common thread among these alternatives is the desire to minimize trust in third-party extensions, with some users expressing a preference for solutions they can control or verify themselves.

Finally, there was a philosophical debate about the nature of using tools to "fix" services one dislikes. One commenter argued it was a "tragedy" to depend on things you hate and suggested simply abandoning them. However, others countered that for many, these tools are essential for navigating links shared on platforms like HN or following specific creators, making the "just quit" argument impractical.

## [My Snapdragon Dev Kit was healthy and working fine until a Windows update failed](https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/how-microsoft-killed-my-snapdragon-devkit/)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46521860

> **Article:** The author, Jason Eckert, recounts how his Microsoft Snapdragon Dev Kit, a small ARM-based PC for developers, became unusable after a failed Windows update. The device, which was working perfectly, began to exhibit random boot failures (rebooting or powering off at the Snapdragon logo) after the update process failed. The author details his troubleshooting steps, including reseating components and testing the SSD in another machine, but found no hardware faults. He concludes that the Windows update corrupted the system's firmware or boot chain, effectively "killing" the device, and expresses frustration with the lack of support for what is now a cancelled product line.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is divided on whether to blame Microsoft or suspect a hardware failure. A significant portion of the commenters argue that the symptoms—specifically the random nature of the boot failures—are classic indicators of a hardware fault, most likely failing RAM or a faulty SSD controller, rather than a software issue. They suggest the Windows update was merely a coincidence or the final stressor on an already failing component.

However, other users and even some of the hardware-focused commenters acknowledge the timing is suspicious. They point out that many other owners of the same dev kit reported similar issues around the same time, making a widespread hardware coincidence unlikely. This group believes Microsoft's update process could have corrupted the device's firmware, especially given its experimental and now-cancelled status, which implies a lack of ongoing support and quality assurance.

Broader themes also emerged, including a general distrust of Microsoft's update quality control and the precariousness of relying on experimental hardware from large corporations. Several commenters used the opportunity to criticize the Windows on ARM platform in general, citing its poor Linux support and the cancellation of the dev kit as signs that the ecosystem is not a serious contender. The discussion also touched on the importance of long-term hardware support and how negative experiences with a product can permanently damage a brand's reputation.

## [Oral microbiome sequencing after taking probiotics](https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/oral-microbiome-biogaia)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46518804

> **Article:** The article is a personal science blog post detailing an experiment by the author to test the effects of a specific oral probiotic, BioGaia Gastrus (which contains *Lactobacillus reuteri*), on their oral microbiome. Using a direct-to-consumer 16S rRNA sequencing service (Plasmidsaurus), the author took daily oral swabs for a month—before, during, and after taking the probiotic—to see if the beneficial bacteria would colonize their mouth and what changes, if any, would occur.

The key finding was that the probiotic did not appear to colonize the mouth; the author could not detect an increase in *L. reuteri* in their oral samples. However, they did observe significant day-to-day variation in their oral microbiome composition. The author concludes that while the experiment was inconclusive regarding the probiotic's effectiveness, it demonstrated the feasibility of personal microbiome tracking as a hobbyist project.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, touching on the original experiment's methodology, the broader challenges of managing microbiome-related health issues, and the practicalities of consumer-level biohacking.

Several commenters engaged directly with the experiment's results. One user noted their own surprising experience with a similar oral probiotic, which altered their perception of fresh breath. Another, however, critiqued the author's methodology, pointing out the lack of a proper control period (sequencing without the probiotic) to distinguish the supplement's effects from normal daily variation.

A significant portion of the discussion shifted to the difficulty of getting medical help for gut and microbiome problems. A user shared a detailed personal story of suffering from post-antibiotic gut issues (SIBO, H. pylori) and feeling dismissed by doctors, leading them to self-experimentation. This resonated with others, who discussed the variability in doctor quality and the need for patients to be proactive, while also cautioning against falling for "woo" or unproven remedies.

Finally, the conversation covered practical advice and the broader context of the biohacking movement. Users shared tips on the importance of refrigeration for probiotic viability and pointed to fiber as having stronger scientific backing for gut health.

## [Electronic nose for indoor mold detection and identification](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adsr.202500124)
**Score:** 164 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46520935

> **Article:** The linked article, published in *Advanced Sensor Research*, details the development of an "electronic nose" (e-nose) designed for the detection and identification of indoor mold. The technology is based on a sensor array utilizing SnO2 (Tin Oxide) nanofibers enhanced with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This nanocomposite material creates local p-n heterojunctions, which significantly improves the sensor's performance. Key advancements include a dramatic increase in sensitivity and selectivity, a reduction in the optimal operating temperature to room temperature (which lowers power consumption and battery life), and a much faster recovery time (down to 28 seconds from minutes). The system is intended to provide a more accessible and rapid alternative to professional mold inspections, which are often expensive and focus only on suspected areas.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this article explores the technology's practical applications, underlying scientific principles, and broader context. A central theme is the potential for this technology to empower homeowners and individuals concerned about mold. One user shared a personal story about their mother's declining health and a persistent, unusual smell in her home, wondering if it could be linked to mold and vascular dementia. This highlights the real-world stakes and the potential for such devices to provide answers in situations where medical professionals may not suspect environmental factors.

The conversation also touched on the practicalities of bringing such a device to market. Users discussed the high cost and specialized nature of current professional mold testing, creating a clear demand for a DIY solution. While some were optimistic, others pointed out the challenges, referencing a commercial spin-off (SMELLDECT GmbH) that requires a formal sales process rather than being a simple consumer product. A user also asked about the possibility of a "full-house scan," perhaps using a drone, indicating a desire for comprehensive, automated monitoring.

On a technical level, users delved into the sensor's material science, with one contributor providing several academic references on graphene-enhanced SnO2 sensors, confirming the article's claims about improved sensitivity and room-temperature operation.

Finally, the discussion broadened to include the fundamental difficulty of creating artificial senses. Users contrasted vision (detecting photons) with smell (detecting complex molecules), noting that the latter is far more challenging to engineer and verify. Skeptical or alternative viewpoints were also present, with one user dismissing the need for complex sensors by suggesting simple solutions like negative ion generators, while another questioned the effectiveness of such methods. The limitations of current DIY mold test kits (which often rely on slow culturing or microscopy) were also noted, reinforcing the need for more advanced solutions like the one proposed in the article.

## [High-Performance DBMSs with io_uring: When and How to use it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04859)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46517319

> **Article:** The paper "High-Performance DBMSs with io_uring: When and How to use it" provides a practical guide for developers on leveraging Linux's `io_uring` for database management systems. It argues that `io_uring` is not a simple drop-in replacement for traditional I/O but enables a fundamental architectural shift. The key benefits are a unified interface for both storage and network I/O, true asynchronous operations that eliminate system call overhead, and efficient batching of requests. The authors recommend a "thread-per-core" model where each thread manages its own ring, overlapping computation with I/O. For maximum performance, they suggest a progressive approach: first confirm I/O is the bottleneck, then adopt async/batching, and finally consider advanced features like polling (SQPOLL/IOPOLL) or zero-copy only if necessary. The paper demonstrates significant throughput gains (up to 300k tx/s) on a DBMS benchmark using these techniques.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was highly positive, with users praising the paper for its clarity and practical advice. The authors were actively engaged, answering questions and acknowledging feedback.

Key points of discussion included:

*   **Architectural Details:** A detailed exchange clarified the nuances of polling modes. Users learned that IOPOLL (for storage) and SQPOLL (for submission) are not mutually exclusive, and that IOPOLL requires a separate ring for network I/O. The consensus was that a thread-per-core architecture is ideal for modern DBMSs using `io_uring`.
*   **Deployment and Security:** A major theme was the real-world applicability of `io_uring`. Commenters pointed out that its use is restricted in Docker containers and some cloud sandboxes due to security vulnerabilities. However, it is fully supported on virtual machines from major cloud providers, making it viable for many production environments.
*   **Critiques and Corrections:** The community offered several technical corrections. One user noted that the paper incorrectly stated enterprise SSDs don't require `fsync` for durability, clarifying that while capacitors can protect a drive's cache, the OS still needs to issue a flush command to guarantee data persistence. Another user corrected the paper's description of `malloc` as a system call.
*   **Practical Adoption:** Users discussed the challenges of adopting `io_uring`'s newer features, noting that many language libraries lag behind the C `liburing` library, which is maintained by the kernel developer and tracks new features closely.

## [“Stop Designing Languages. Write Libraries Instead” (2016)](https://lbstanza.org/purpose_of_programming_languages.html)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46525640

> **Article:** The article "Stop Designing Languages. Write Libraries Instead" argues that developers should focus on creating libraries within existing, powerful general-purpose languages rather than inventing new Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). The author posits that the primary goal of a programming language is to make libraries easy to write and use. A language with powerful features (like Ruby's metaprogramming and first-class functions) allows for the creation of libraries that are just as expressive and user-friendly as a dedicated DSL. The author uses Ruby on Rails as a prime example: it provides a DSL-like experience for web development but is implemented as a library, leveraging Ruby's strengths. This approach avoids the high cost of forcing users to adopt an entirely new language and toolchain, offering a more pragmatic path to solving domain-specific problems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of agreement, nuance, and direct disagreement with the article's premise. A recurring theme is the critique of the article's title, which some found misleading or overly simplistic, though many who read the piece found its core argument to be insightful. The central debate revolves around the distinction and relationship between languages and libraries. Some commenters argue that the line is blurry, citing JSON as an example of a data format that effectively became a "language" through the libraries built around it.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the practical trade-offs between creating a new language versus a new library. The library-first approach is praised for its convenience, as it respects a developer's existing environment, habits, and tooling, and lowers the barrier to adoption. However, other users champion the "Strong Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis," arguing that a new language can fundamentally change how a developer thinks about and solves a problem in a way that a library cannot fully replicate. The discussion also touched on real-world examples, with one user providing a script in Elixir to demonstrate how modern, typed languages can be used for scripting, while another commenter passionately defended Ruby's design and lamented its decline, attributing it more to ecosystem and community factors than to the language itself.

## [Why the trans flag emoji is the 5-codepoint sequence it is](https://hecate.pink/blog/2026/trans-flag-emoji/)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46520879

> **Article:** The article "Why the trans flag emoji is the 5-codepoint sequence it is" explains the technical process behind creating the transgender flag emoji. It details how, due to the Unicode Consortium's moratorium on adding new flag images, the trans flag was created using a sequence of existing codepoints. This sequence combines a white flag (U+1F3F3), a variation selector (U+FE0F) to ensure it renders as a graphic, a zero-width joiner (U+200D), and the male/female symbol (U+26A7). The author also discusses the challenges of ensuring this sequence renders correctly across different platforms and fonts, and the history of how it was proposed and adopted.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is split between technical appreciation for the article's content and significant debate over its presentation and accessibility. Several users found the website's design—with its animated particles and pink/black theme—difficult to read, prompting suggestions to use browser reader modes. This sparked a sub-thread on web accessibility versus a creator's artistic freedom, with some defending the author's right to design their personal blog as they wish.

Technically, commenters expressed fascination with the "behind-the-scenes" process of emoji creation, with some comparing the codepoint sequences to Stargate addresses. There was a broader debate on the role of flags and emoji within the Unicode standard. Some argued that Unicode should stick to text and not include pictorial symbols like flags, while others explained that emoji support was necessary to accommodate pre-existing Japanese carrier-specific standards and ensure universal text encoding. The conversation also touched upon the politics of emoji approval, with one user suggesting that China's influence is a primary reason for the moratorium on new national flags. Finally, a minor thread emerged when a user's use of ChatGPT to summarize the article was criticized as unnecessary, given that browser reader modes were already being discussed.

## [Locating a Photo of a Vehicle in 30 Seconds with GeoSpy](https://geospy.ai/blog/locating-a-photo-of-a-vehicle-in-30-seconds-with-geospy)
**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46515948

> **Article:** The article from GeoSpy.ai demonstrates a tool that uses AI to geolocate photos with high accuracy, specifically by analyzing a photo of a vehicle. The post highlights the speed of the process (under 30 seconds) and suggests the technology can be used to locate stolen vehicles, noting that thieves often post photos of them on platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist. The article frames this as a tool for law enforcement or asset recovery to track down criminals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by skepticism regarding the ethics and potential misuse of the technology. While some users identified the location in the article's example photo (San Francisco) or compared the tech to existing surveillance networks like Flock, the majority of comments focused on privacy concerns. Many argued that such tools should be illegal due to the risk of stalking and harassment, mocking the company's patriotic marketing language ("safeguard American freedom") as a cover for invasive surveillance.

There was also a debate regarding the article's claim that thieves sell stolen cars on Facebook Marketplace. While one commenter found the claim dubious, others provided evidence that this is a common method for fencing stolen goods, particularly for bikes and, increasingly, cars. A separate thread speculated that the primary customers for this technology might actually be repo agencies rather than police, using social media photos to locate vehicles for banks.

## [Self hosting my media library with Jellyfin and Wireguard on Hetzner](https://layandreas.github.io/personal-blog/posts/how-spotify-made-me-self-host/)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46517636

> **Article:** The article details the author's journey to self-host their media library as an alternative to Spotify. The setup involves using a Hetzner cloud server to run Jellyfin for media management and streaming, with WireGuard for secure remote access. The motivation stems from frustration with Spotify's rising prices, the introduction of ads, and a desire for greater control and ownership over their media collection. The post serves as a guide and justification for moving away from a centralized streaming platform to a personally managed solution.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted debate on the merits of self-hosting versus using streaming services. The core arguments revolve around ownership, cost, music discovery, and the ethics of streaming platforms.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the ethical and financial drawbacks of streaming services like Spotify. Commenters argue that these platforms devalue music by paying artists poorly, with some pointing out that a single album purchase often provides more financial support to an artist than a year of streaming. Specific criticisms of Spotify include its use of "ghost artists" to reduce royalty payments, not paying for tracks with fewer than 1,000 streams, allowing a flood of AI-generated music, and its CEO's investments in AI weaponry. The desire to "own" content and avoid being "hostage to a platform" is a recurring theme.

On the other side, many users defend streaming for its convenience, particularly for music discovery and access to new releases. The ease of instantly finding and playing new music is seen as a major advantage over the labor-intensive process of acquiring, ripping, and managing files for a self-hosted library. Several commenters also highlighted hybrid solutions, such as Apple Music's and YouTube Music's ability to upload personal files to a cloud locker, which they see as the "best of both worlds."

Practicality and cost were also debated. While the original article's author and others champion self-hosting, some pointed out that a cost comparison was missing, arguing that streaming remains cheaper for casual listeners who explore a wide variety of content. However, others countered that the cost of streaming doesn't effectively fund quality content creation.

Finally, the discussion included numerous technical recommendations for those interested in self-hosting. Alternatives to Jellyfin like Navidrome were mentioned, along with different access methods like Tailscale or simple NFS shares. Users also shared recommendations for client apps for various platforms (iOS, Android, Linux) and discussed other self-hosted services like Immich for photos.

## [Dude, where's my supersonic jet?](https://rationaloptimistsociety.substack.com/p/dude-wheres-my-supersonic-jet)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 274 | **ID:** 46515936

> **Article:** The article laments the lack of modern supersonic passenger jets, framing it as a failure of innovation compared to the rapid progress of early aviation. It argues that the barriers to supersonic travel—noise, regulation, and cost—are solvable with modern technology and clever business strategies. The author highlights Boom Supersonic, suggesting their approach of targeting business class passengers on existing routes (charging the same price for half the time) could make supersonic travel viable again. The piece argues that the stagnation in flight speed is a symptom of a broader societal risk-aversion and calls for a return to an era of ambitious technological advancement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the article's premise, arguing that supersonic travel is a solution in search of a problem. A central theme is that the "need for speed" has been obsoleted by technology. Commenters point out that in-flight Wi-Fi, entertainment, and the ability to work effectively on planes have reduced the penalty of longer flight times, while video conferencing can eliminate the need for travel altogether. The economic viability is heavily questioned; many argue that the market for supersonic travel is tiny because the wealthy it targets can already use private jets for speed and convenience, and the time saved is marginal compared to the total door-to-door travel time.

There is significant criticism of Boom Supersonic specifically. Commenters point to the company's recent pivot to selling its engine technology to power AI data centers as a sign of desperation and a fundamentally inefficient design. The discussion also highlights that true progress is about efficiency—doing more with less (fuel, cost)—not just raw speed. Environmental concerns and the immense fuel consumption of supersonic jets are noted as major unaddressed issues. Finally, some users fact-checked the article's claims about the Concorde's fuel usage, finding them exaggerated or misleading, and noted that Concorde's retirement was due to a combination of high costs, aging airframes, and a lack of demand, not just 9/11.
