## [enclose.horse](https://enclose.horse/)
**Score:** 1052 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46509211

> **Article:** enclose.horse is a minimalist daily puzzle game where the player must place a limited number of walls on a grid to trap a horse. The goal is to maximize the enclosed area, which includes collecting bonus "cherries." The game provides a "View Optimal" feature, allowing players to compare their solution against the algorithmically generated best score for that day's puzzle.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community generally received the game positively, frequently comparing its daily, single-puzzle format to the viral success of Wordle. Users discussed the game's mechanics, clarifying that walls are placed via left-click (not right-click) and debating the "one chance" design versus the desire for replayability to beat personal scores.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the game's backend logic and algorithmic challenges. One of the developers revealed that the optimal solutions are computed using Answer Set Programming (specifically the Clingo engine), noting that maximizing enclosed areas with flood-fill constraints is likely NP-hard. Users also speculated on alternative approaches, such as constraint programming.

Other notable points included:
*   **Mechanics Confusion:** Some users expected the horse to move as walls were placed, drawing comparisons to John Conway's "Angel Problem."
*   **Feature Requests:** Players requested a side-by-side or diff view for comparing solutions and an option to disable the 3D visual effect of the walls.
*   **Domain Name:** A meta-discussion arose about the common developer habit of acquiring domain names before having a concrete idea for a project.

## [Vietnam bans unskippable ads](https://saigoneer.com/vietnam-news/28652-vienam-bans-unskippable-ads,-requires-skip-button-to-appear-after-5-seconds)
**Score:** 990 | **Comments:** 546 | **ID:** 46514677

> **Article:** Vietnam has introduced a new regulation banning unskippable ads on online video platforms. The rule requires that a "skip" button must appear after an ad has played for 5 seconds. This move is aimed at improving the user experience by preventing viewers from being forced to watch lengthy advertisements before accessing their desired content. The regulation specifically targets the growing online video market in Vietnam, including platforms like YouTube and Facebook.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Vietnam's new ad regulation is multifaceted, with users debating the practical implications, the broader philosophy of advertising, and potential unintended consequences.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on how platforms and advertisers might adapt. Several users predict that this will lead to a higher volume of shorter, skippable ads to maintain revenue, potentially making the user experience worse overall. One commenter noted that the 5-second skip button actually provides valuable data to companies like Google, as it signals that a real human has engaged with the ad, which could make this format even more desirable for advertisers.

The discussion also broadened into a philosophical critique of advertising itself. Many commenters expressed a strong anti-ad sentiment, arguing that the world would be better without ads, which they described as "poisonous" and designed to create dissatisfaction. This led to a sub-thread about the value of subscription models like YouTube Premium as an alternative to ad-supported content, with some users seeing the choice to pay for a service as a good indicator of its actual value.

Finally, there were practical and political considerations. Some users speculated that this could lead to an increase in VPN usage in Vietnam, though others countered that the country's internet censorship might make this less common than one would think. One commenter also provided a more reputable source for the news, while another pointed out a typo in the original article's title.

## [AWS raises GPU prices 15% on a Saturday, hopes you weren't paying attention](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/aws_price_increase/)
**Score:** 657 | **Comments:** 444 | **ID:** 46511153

> **Article:** The Register article reports that AWS has increased the price of its GPU "Capacity Blocks" by 15%. The author frames this as a stealth move, timed for a Saturday to minimize attention. The article highlights the irony that this price hike comes just seven months after AWS announced up to 45% price *reductions* for other GPU instance types (On-Demand and Savings Plans). The piece criticizes the lack of direct communication about the increase, noting that while AWS's pricing page did state that prices were "scheduled to be updated in January 2026," it did not specify the direction of the change.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the reasons for the price increase, the broader trend of rising hardware costs, and skepticism towards cloud providers.

A central debate is the cause of the price hike. Some commenters suggest it's a straightforward supply-and-demand issue, pointing to insatiable demand for AI compute. Others propose a more nuanced financial explanation, arguing that a price increase could signal that providers expect GPUs to have a shorter useful lifespan, thus needing to recoup their investment faster. A key clarification was made that the increase applies specifically to "Capacity Blocks" (guaranteed capacity), which had promotional pricing, and that this new price may still be lower than the general-purpose On-Demand instances that were recently discounted.

Many commenters broadened the topic to lament the rising cost of all personal computing components, including GPUs, RAM, and storage. This sparked a discussion about a potential future where individuals can no longer afford powerful hardware, leading to a "thin client" model where all computing is done via subscription-based cloud services. This trend was viewed with significant pessimism, with users worrying about a loss of ownership and control.

Finally, there was a strong undercurrent of cynicism towards cloud providers. The article's "stealth hike" narrative resonated with commenters who shared their own frustrations with AWS's communication practices. The discussion also touched on the "enshittification" of cloud services and the idea that the era of consistent price reductions may be over, with one user pointing to the recent price hike for IPv4 addresses as another example of this trend.

## [The Post-American Internet](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/)
**Score:** 514 | **Comments:** 401 | **ID:** 46509019

> **Article:** The article "The Post-American Internet," by Cory Doctorow, argues that the world is moving towards a fragmented internet, no longer dominated by the United States. This shift is driven by the "enshittification" of US-based tech platforms (like Apple and Google), which have become increasingly exploitative of users and business customers to maximize profit. Doctorow posits that this creates an opportunity for other regions, particularly the EU, to build a more sovereign and competitive digital ecosystem. A key proposal is for the EU to repeal pro-US copyright and anti-circumvention laws (like Article 6 of the Copyright Directive). This would empower developers to create and sell tools like hardware dongles for jailbreaking phones, enabling alternative app stores and breaking the duopoly of Apple and Google, thereby fostering genuine competition and restoring user control over their devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion explores the feasibility and potential consequences of a "post-American internet," focusing on the power dynamics between the US, EU, and major tech corporations. A central debate revolves around the practical ability of the EU to decouple from US tech. Some commenters argue that US tech giants hold overwhelming leverage, suggesting they could "brick" devices or cease operations in the EU, effectively crippling its digital infrastructure. Others counter that this is economically implausible, as the EU represents a massive market that companies like Apple cannot afford to abandon.

The conversation also highlights the complex role of the EU itself. While seen as a potential champion for digital sovereignty and consumer rights, the EU is also criticized for its own regulatory overreach and surveillance initiatives, creating a paradox where it protects users from corporations while simultaneously building a "surveillance state." This is often contrasted with the US, which is also noted for its own mass surveillance programs.

Finally, the discussion touches on the user-centric challenges of such a transition. Even if legal and technical barriers were removed, user inertia remains a significant hurdle; most consumers are unwilling to engage with complex workarounds like jailbreaking, preferring the convenience of established ecosystems. There is also a sense of skepticism about whether a truly open alternative would emerge, or if it would simply be replaced by a new set of regulated, less innovative platforms.

## [65% of Hacker News posts have negative sentiment, and they outperform](https://philippdubach.com/standalone/hn-sentiment/)
**Score:** 449 | **Comments:** 435 | **ID:** 46512881

> **Article:** The article analyzes the sentiment of Hacker News posts and comments using a machine learning classifier. The key finding is that posts with negative sentiment significantly outperform others, receiving more comments and higher scores. The author notes that 65% of posts have a negative sentiment, and these posts achieve an average score of 35, compared to 15 for neutral posts and 10 for positive ones. The study also observes that negative sentiment increases with the number of comments, suggesting that negativity drives engagement on the platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's findings, with users expressing that the result is unsurprising. The consensus is that negativity is a natural driver of engagement, both on HN and in media at large. Key themes in the conversation include:

*   **Inevitable Bias:** Many commenters argue that negative bias is a fundamental aspect of human psychology and media, rooted in an evolutionary need to prioritize threats for survival. It's seen as a natural, unavoidable phenomenon rather than a unique flaw of Hacker News.
*   **Engagement Mechanics:** Users provide practical reasons for the trend. "I agree" comments are rare, so critical or negative posts are more likely to provoke a written response. One user shared their own analysis, confirming that clickbaity or controversial titles perform best.
*   **Critique of Methodology:** A user pointed out a potential flaw in the study's data, noting that the average post score of 35 seems unusually high. The author acknowledged this could be due to a sampling skew and welcomed the feedback.
*   **Skepticism and Irony:** Some responses were humorous or skeptical, questioning the validity of "black box" sentiment analysis and ironically framing the negative news itself.
*   **Desire for a Solution:** One user expressed a desire for tools to filter out negativity, highlighting the personal toll that constant criticism can take, even for those who recognize its prevalence.

## [C Is Best (2025)](https://sqlite.org/whyc.html)
**Score:** 365 | **Comments:** 476 | **ID:** 46511470

> **Article:** The article "Why Is SQLite Coded In C?" is a defense of the C programming language for large-scale, critical software projects. Authored by the SQLite development team, it argues that C's perceived weaknesses (like being unsafe) are outweighed by its strengths: extreme portability, stability, backward compatibility, and the ubiquity of compilers. The author contends that newer languages like Rust or C++ introduce complexity, build dependencies, and potential future instability that are unsuitable for a project like SQLite, which aims to be a "boring," reliable foundation for decades to come. The article explicitly lists reasons why C was chosen and addresses common criticisms, concluding that for SQLite's specific goals, C remains the superior choice.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the SQLite team's stance, with most commenters agreeing that C is the right tool for this specific job. The community sentiment is that while newer languages like Rust offer compelling safety features, they lack the decades of maturity, stability, and portability that C provides. A key theme is that the choice of language depends on the project's goals; for a foundational library like SQLite that must be ubiquitous and boring, C is ideal. However, the debate isn't entirely one-sided. Several users point out that C's "boringness" is a hard-won status, and that newer languages will eventually achieve similar stability. Specific criticisms of Rust, such as its handling of out-of-memory errors (a point also raised by Linus Torvalds), are cited as valid reasons for caution. While some mention alternative languages like Zig or Ada/SPARK as potential future options, the consensus is that it's too early for a project as critical as SQLite to switch. The discussion ultimately frames C not as a perfect language, but as the most pragmatic and proven tool for ensuring SQLite's legendary reliability and portability.

## [Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?](https://akr.am/blog/posts/why-is-the-gmail-app-700-mb)
**Score:** 342 | **Comments:** 310 | **ID:** 46514692

> **Article:** The article, titled "Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?", poses a question about the large disk size of the Gmail mobile app without providing a definitive answer. The author expresses surprise at the app's size, comparing it to much smaller native mail clients and speculating that it might be due to the inclusion of numerous features like chat, video calls, and AI. The piece serves more as a prompt for discussion than an in-depth technical analysis of the app's composition.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees that the original article fails to answer its own question, but uses it as a springboard for speculation. The most prominent theory, proposed by user loloquwowndueo, is that the large size is due to Google's cross-platform strategy. On iOS, instead of using native Apple frameworks, Google bundles its own runtimes and libraries (like those for its UI or internal services) within the app, allowing them to write the code once and deploy it across both iOS and Android. This is contrasted with Apple's native apps, which leverage smaller, pre-existing system frameworks.

Other key points of discussion include:

*   **Feature Bloat:** Many commenters suggest the size is a result of cramming numerous non-email features into a single application, such as Chat, Meet, and integrated 2FA. One user humorously speculated it might include a local LLM for writing emails.
*   **Accumulated "Garbage":** A developer with experience in large apps argued that most of the bloat isn't intentional but is "garbage" accumulated over years. This includes outdated code, unused assets, and third-party SDKs added for specific features or tracking, which are never removed.
*   **Rejection of Conspiracy Theories:** Users dismissed ideas that the app's size is a ploy to force cloud subscriptions or to sell more storage on iPhones, finding those motives illogical for Google.
*   **Clarification of Metrics:** One commenter pointed out that the article's 700 MB refers to disk space, not RAM usage, clarifying a common point of confusion.

## [Volkswagen Brings Back Physical Buttons](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a69916699/volkswagen-interior-physical-buttons-return/)
**Score:** 292 | **Comments:** 18 | **ID:** 46514913

> **Article:** Car and Driver reports that Volkswagen is reversing its trend of minimalist, screen-heavy interiors by reintroducing physical buttons and knobs in its upcoming electric models, such as the ID.2all concept. The article notes that this decision follows customer feedback and industry criticism regarding the usability and safety of touch-only controls. VW's CEO admitted that the previous reliance on touchscreens was a mistake, acknowledging that physical controls are essential for intuitive operation and reducing driver distraction. The new design philosophy will feature dedicated buttons for critical functions like volume, defrost, and window controls, moving away from the controversial haptic sliders and screen-based menus that have defined recent models.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed Volkswagen's decision, framing it as a necessary correction to the industry-wide over-reliance on touchscreens. The consensus is that physical buttons are safer because they allow drivers to operate essential functions by feel without taking their eyes off the road. Many commenters argued that automakers blindly copied Tesla's minimalist approach without understanding the underlying context—namely, that Tesla's software-centric model is designed for a future of autonomous driving, which doesn't apply to traditional cars.

However, some users offered nuanced counterpoints. One commenter warned against overcorrecting, citing their Toyota's confusing cluster of physical buttons that still requires looking at a screen for feedback. Another pointed out that while physical controls are generally better, the sheer number of buttons on VW's new steering wheel might be excessive. The discussion also broadened to include the aviation industry as a benchmark for safety-critical interface design, which continues to prioritize physical controls. Finally, the conversation touched on related frustrations with other manufacturers, like Tesla's removal of physical gear shifters and turn signal stalks.

## [I/O is no longer the bottleneck? (2022)](https://stoppels.ch/2022/11/27/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck.html)
**Score:** 253 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46506994

> **Article:** The article "I/O is no longer the bottleneck?" (2022) argues that with the advent of high-speed NVMe SSDs, the traditional bottleneck of disk I/O has shifted. The author demonstrates that on modern hardware, sequential read speeds from storage can exceed the rate at which a single CPU core can process that data. The core limitation is now memory bandwidth and CPU processing power, specifically the "memcpy" speed or the ability to feed a single core with data. The article suggests that software design patterns from the era of slow hard drives may no longer be relevant and that new approaches, such as zero-copy data formats that allow skipping irrelevant data, are necessary to fully leverage modern hardware capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance and context. A central theme is that the "I/O bottleneck" was never just about sequential read speeds. Commenters point out that for traditional hard drives, the bottleneck was random access and seek times, which is a different problem entirely. The conversation then shifts to identifying the new bottlenecks.

Several key points emerge:
*   **The New Bottleneck is Memory-to-CPU Bandwidth:** The most cited limitation is the speed at which a single CPU core can be fed data from RAM, often cited around 6 GB/s for modern x86 cores (though Apple's M-series chips are noted as an exception). This makes efficient data parsing and memory access patterns critical.
*   **Latency vs. Throughput:** A commenter argues that the primary issue in most slow software isn't the hardware limit but poor programming that ignores latency. Writing serial, blocking code that waits for operations (I/O, network, etc.) leaves the CPU idle. The solution is to parallelize, batch operations, and organize data linearly to keep the CPU busy.
*   **Cloud and Practical Constraints:** Some users counter that for many, especially in cloud environments, I/O remains a significant bottleneck due to virtualization and network-attached storage. The perceived slowness of modern applications is also attributed to poor software design (e.g., blocking I/O on GUI threads) rather than hardware limits.
*   **Future Architectures:** The discussion touches on the potential for new hardware and OS designs where non-volatile storage is directly integrated with the CPU, blurring the lines between memory and storage, though challenges like ensuring true persistence (fsync) remain.

## [Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far](https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/opus-4-5-change-everything/)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 342 | **ID:** 46515696

> **Article:** The article, by Burke Holland, describes his experience with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 as a significant leap beyond previous AI coding agents. He demonstrates its capability by asking it to build a complex, multi-file application (a "Superwhisper" clone) from scratch. Holland is impressed by the model's ability to not just write code, but to independently plan, execute, debug, and iterate on the solution with minimal human intervention. He concludes that Opus 4.5 feels less like a simple tool and more like a genuine "agent" that can manage an entire project lifecycle, fundamentally changing the experience of software development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a microcosm of the broader debate on AI's role in software engineering, with commenters falling into several camps.

A central theme is the tension between AI's power and its practical limitations. While many users corroborated the article's claims, sharing their own success in building complex applications like NES emulators and personal utilities, a significant counter-argument emerged concerning production readiness. Skeptics pointed out that AI-generated solutions often lack edge-case handling, security audits, and long-term maintainability, and tend to be over-engineered compared to simpler human solutions. However, others countered that this is typical of MVP development and that the technology's rapid improvement will likely address these gaps.

The conversation then pivoted to the long-term impact on the software profession. The prevailing sentiment was not one of job replacement but of massive leverage. The printing press analogy was used to suggest that developers who embrace these tools will become vastly more productive, shifting their role from writing code to directing and refining AI agents. This new workflow was described as "guiding and directing" rather than traditional coding. A related point was that this could reduce the need for outsourcing to low-cost labor, as a single developer with AI tools could achieve higher quality and output.

Finally, there was a more philosophical critique. One commenter dismissed the entire trend as "slop," arguing it would only add to the universe of useless, redundant applications. Another user countered that this is a natural reaction to "software enshittification," where building bespoke, personal tools is a way to escape the ads and subscriptions of commercial software. The discussion also touched on the difficulty of creating reliable benchmarks to objectively measure these advancements, with one user noting that solving this problem is a path to becoming a billionaire.

## [State of the Fin 2026-01-06](https://jellyfin.org/posts/state-of-the-fin-2026-01-06/)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46514282

> **Article:** This "State of the Fin" post from January 2026 is a progress report from the Jellyfin project, a free, open-source media server. The article details recent development efforts, focusing on stability and bug fixes following the major 10.11.0 release. It highlights work on the Android TV and web clients, and specifically mentions the status of the long-awaited official Samsung TV client, which is currently undergoing Samsung's app store review process. The post serves as an update to the community on ongoing development, migration issues, and future goals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive towards Jellyfin, often framed as a direct reaction to growing dissatisfaction with Plex. The central theme is that Plex has lost its way, shifting from a user-centric media server to a "streaming company" that imposes unwanted features and costs, particularly for remote access. This has motivated many users to switch to Jellyfin.

Several users share personal stories of building extensive self-hosted "homelabs" (using tools like Proxmox, Tailscale, and OPNsense) that were inspired by the initial step of setting up Jellyfin. While Plex is praised for its polished client software and ease of use (especially its one-time lifetime fee), the open-source nature and self-hosting freedom of Jellyfin are seen as a compelling long-term alternative.

Key pain points and points of discussion for Jellyfin include:
*   **Client Availability:** The lack of a native, easily installable app for Samsung TVs is a major frustration, though it's noted that one is in development. The Apple TV situation is also discussed, with users recommending the third-party "Infuse" app or the "Swiftfin" client as solutions.
*   **Feature Parity:** Some users acknowledge that Jellyfin still lags behind Plex in features and polish, but are willing to contribute or wait for it to catch up.
*   **Upgrade Stability:** The recent 10.11.0 upgrade was reportedly problematic for some, but the team's subsequent point releases have resolved most issues, encouraging users on older versions to finally upgrade.

**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46507963

> **Article:** The article is a detailed technical write-up by Zakhary on how he created a custom 88x31 pixel web button that plays a Game Boy Color (GBC) boot animation. The author explains the entire process, starting from the motivation of reviving the "web button" trend of the 90s. The technical breakdown covers: capturing the original GBC boot ROM frames (using an emulator and manual screenshotting), converting the frames to a pixel-art friendly palette, and implementing the animation as an HTML `<canvas>` element with JavaScript to ensure it remains crisp and lightweight without relying on GIFs. The post serves as both a nostalgic project and a technical tutorial for creating high-quality, retro-style web assets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded very positively to the article, with commenters expressing nostalgia for the "web button" era of the 1990s. Several users reminisced about the cultural significance of these buttons, recalling them as badges of honor for webmasters (e.g., "Written in Notepad") or tools for online activism. The discussion expanded to include links to archives of vintage buttons and userbars.

Technically, the conversation focused on the author's process. While most praised the detailed step-by-step guide, a few offered alternative, potentially simpler methods for capturing the animation frames, such as using emulator-specific recording features or non-lossy screen recording software. There was also a brief, humorous mention of the risks of Nintendo litigation, though the author remained lighthearted about it. Overall, the thread celebrated the project as a fun, well-executed revival of a niche internet artifact.

> **Article:** The article, "Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding," introduces a method for coding on a smartphone via the terminal. The author proposes a setup that uses an SSH client (like Termius), a terminal multiplexer (tmux) to keep sessions alive, and a VPN (like Tailscale) to securely connect to a remote development machine. The goal is to transform idle time, such as commuting, into productive coding sessions by leveraging AI assistants (like Claude) and a command-line interface, effectively turning the phone into a portable terminal for a more powerful computer.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive but pragmatic, with users sharing practical advice and debating the concept's viability.

Key themes include:
*   **Practical Implementation:** Users immediately began sharing tips to improve the setup. The most common recommendation was using `tmux` to maintain persistent sessions, especially when the phone screen is off. Others suggested using `bat` for better syntax highlighting in diffs and mentioned alternative terminal apps like Blink for better scrolling performance with tmux.
*   **Real-World Use Cases:** Several commenters shared personal anecdotes of coding on phones, either out of necessity (not having a computer) or for convenience during transit. This practice was noted as being particularly common in some developing countries.
*   **Productivity and Focus:** A significant point of debate was the practicality of the concept. One commenter argued that phone-based coding is inefficient for complex tasks and that "in-between" time is better used for rest or exercise. Another countered that it can be effective for incremental work, citing their own experience finishing an app this way.
*   **Security:** A user raised a security concern about the author exposing their local network identifiers in the demo images, prompting the author to rebuild their network as a precaution.

> **Article:** The article from Web Design Museum is a visual exhibition showcasing the design of video game websites from the early 2000s. It features screenshots of classic sites like Nintendo, MiniClip, Newgrounds, and various gaming magazines, highlighting the distinct aesthetic of the era. This includes the heavy use of Flash animations, high-information-density layouts, pixel art, and designs that were often built around specific screen resolutions and CRT monitors.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is a wave of nostalgia, with users universally agreeing that the era represented a "peak" of web creativity and information density. Many commenters shared personal memories of specific sites that shaped their childhoods or careers, such as Newgrounds, MiniClip, PlanetQuake, and Happy Puppy.

A key theme was the contrast between the "wild west" creativity of the past and the constraints of the modern web. Users attributed the decline of this style to several factors:
*   **The rise of mobile devices:** This is cited as the primary reason for the shift away from high-density, fixed-width designs.
*   **Technological shifts:** The death of Flash is mourned by some as a loss of creative tooling, despite its technical flaws. The "frameworkification" of the web and centralization of app stores were also blamed for stifling indie creativity.
*   **Design trends:** The move towards flat design was seen as a factor that killed off the ornate, textured aesthetics of the early 2000s.

There was also a technical discussion about the methods used, with users recalling the clever hacks of the time, such as using HTML tables and image slicing to create complex layouts that worked on the limited screen sizes of the day.

## [A prediction market user made $436k betting on Maduro's downfall](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gn93292do)
**Score:** 122 | **Comments:** 184 | **ID:** 46508582

> **Article:** The BBC article reports on a user of the prediction market platform Polymarket who won $436,000 by betting on the downfall of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The user placed a large bet of over $32,000 just hours before a secret military operation became public knowledge. The article highlights the incident as a prime example of the potential for insider trading and market manipulation on such platforms, raising questions about the legality and ethics of using non-public information to make profitable bets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the legality, ethics, and fundamental purpose of insider information in prediction markets. A primary theme was the comparison to traditional finance, with many commenters noting that while insider trading is illegal in the stock market, it is a legal and arguably intended feature of prediction markets, which are essentially unregulated gambling platforms.

Several key points emerged:
*   **Insider Trading as a Feature vs. Bug:** A significant debate arose over whether this is a flaw or a core function. Some argued that relying on privileged information is the only way to gain a real edge, distinguishing it from "random gambling." Others contended that rampant manipulation and insider advantage will prevent mass adoption by making retail users feel unsafe.
*   **Legality and Regulation:** Commenters clarified that federal insider trading laws don't apply to these markets, though other crimes like wire fraud could potentially be committed. There was skepticism that government entities would be motivated to manipulate these markets, as the sums involved ($436k) are considered "peanuts" for state-level actors who have other, more lucrative avenues for exploitation.
*   **Market Integrity and Accuracy:** The discussion touched on the reliability of prediction markets. One user explained the concept of "calibration" (e.g., if a market predicts a 60% chance of an event, it should be correct 60% of the time over the long run) and noted that market efficiencies can correct biases over time.
*   **Future Implications:** Some commenters mused on the potential for governments to use prediction markets for strategic deception, such as creating decoy positions to mislead adversaries about military plans.

## [Calling All Hackers: How money works (2024)](https://phrack.org/issues/71/17)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 32 | **ID:** 46518129

> **Article:** The article "Calling All Hackers: How money works" is a beginner's guide to finance and economics, specifically written for a technical audience. The author, a hacker, attempts to demystify complex financial concepts by drawing analogies to computer systems. Key topics covered include the nature of money (as a ledger), the mechanics of stocks, bonds, IPOs, and derivatives. The piece also explains the roles of central banks, the concept of inflation, and the dynamics of market crashes. The central thesis is that financial markets are complex, computational systems that hackers, with their problem-solving mindset, are well-equipped to understand and potentially leverage for their own benefit.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely critical of the article's depth and accuracy, though some readers found it a useful primer. A significant portion of the comments focused on correcting the article's technical oversimplifications, particularly regarding fractional reserve banking and accounting principles. One user pointed out a major error in the article's explanation of debt, stating that it incorrectly calculates liabilities by excluding interest.

Beyond technical critiques, the discussion explored broader themes. A notable thread debated the article's premise that founders often feel they are "wasting their twenties." Commenters contrasted the high-risk, all-consuming life of a founder with a more balanced "9-5" job, which allows more time for personal life, friendships, and hobbies. This led to a consensus that the choice between these paths is a privilege, as many jobs are both demanding and poorly paid.

While some commenters praised the article for its accessible, systems-based approach to finance, the prevailing sentiment was that it was too superficial. Several users recommended more in-depth books, such as David Graeber's "Debt," as superior alternatives for understanding the true nature of money and economics.

> **Article:** The article links to "SCiZE's Classic Warez Collection," a comprehensive online archive (scenelist.org) documenting the "Warez scene" of the 1980s and 1990s. The site serves as a historical repository for the underground culture of software piracy, specifically focusing on the release groups that cracked and distributed software. It features extensive lists of groups, individuals, and their contributions, including a searchable section for "NFO" files—text files that accompanied releases, containing group credits, greetings, and scene politics. The collection is a nostalgic look at the pre-internet era of BBS (Bulletin Board Systems), modems, and the global network of enthusiasts who shared software.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the archive with a strong sense of nostalgia and appreciation for its historical preservation. Many commenters shared personal anecdotes of their involvement in the scene, recalling their time running BBSes (often from their parents' homes), using specific software like Renegade, and participating in IRC channels such as #warezgraphics and #oldwarez. The discussion highlighted the cultural significance of the era, from the pronunciation of "warez" to the thrill of "phreaking" phone calls to connect with groups internationally.

Beyond personal memories, the conversation touched on the scene's lasting impact on the broader tech world. One commenter, a prominent figure in computer security, noted that the old warez and cracking scenes had an "outsize impact" on modern security, influencing tools like GRSecurity, reverse engineering techniques, and even major vulnerability discoveries. There was also a shared interest in the media documenting this subculture, with users recommending the documentary "BBS: The Documentary" and the TV series "The Scene." Overall, the comments reflect a community that views the warez scene not just as piracy, but as a formative and technically innovative part of computing history.

## [Mamdani Targets Junk Fees and Hidden Charges in Two Executive Orders](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/nyregion/mamdani-affordability-consumer-protections.html)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46514059

> **Article:** The New York Times article reports that New York City Mayor Mamdani has signed two executive orders targeting "junk fees" and hidden charges. The orders aim to protect consumers and renters by cracking down on deceptive pricing and difficult cancellation processes, particularly for gym memberships and subscriptions. The article frames these actions as an early implementation of Mamdani's "leftist political agenda," noting that the efforts are a continuation of consumer protection work already underway in the state by figures like Attorney General Letitia James and former FTC official Lina Khan.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely supportive of the mayor's actions, viewing the regulation of junk fees as a common-sense consumer protection rather than a partisan issue. Several users expressed frustration that the article frames this as a "leftist" agenda, arguing that preventing consumers from being scammed is a universal concern that shouldn't be politicized.

The conversation touched on several key themes:
*   **Political Framing:** Users debated the NYT's characterization of the orders, with many feeling it unfairly labels basic consumer advocacy as radical. It was noted that progressive policies have been labeled "communist" in US politics for a long time.
*   **Governmental Power:** There was a discussion about the nature of executive orders. While acknowledged as less durable than laws, users saw them as an effective tool for building public support and testing policies before potential codification.
*   **Scope of Government:** Commenters discussed the appropriate level for such regulations, concluding that state and city governments are effective "laboratories" for policy, with California cited as a prime example of successful state-level consumer protection laws.
*   **Further Suggestions:** One user proposed a more ambitious policy: requiring companies that hold consumer funds (like gift cards or app balances) to pay interest, though others countered that the administrative complexity and low interest rates would make it impractical.
