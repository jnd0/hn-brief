## [Vietnam bans unskippable ads](https://saigoneer.com/vietnam-news/28652-vienam-bans-unskippable-ads,-requires-skip-button-to-appear-after-5-seconds)
**Score:** 1439 | **Comments:** 738 | **ID:** 46514677

> **Article:** Vietnam has introduced a new regulation banning unskippable video advertisements on online platforms. The rule requires that a "skip" button must appear after no more than 5 seconds of an ad playing. This move is aimed at improving user experience by preventing viewers from being forced to watch long, intrusive ads before accessing their desired content. The article notes that this will significantly impact how advertisers and platforms like YouTube operate within the country.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Vietnam's new ad regulation was multifaceted, with users debating the practical, economic, and philosophical implications.

A primary theme was the likely economic and behavioral response from platforms like Google. Several users predicted that to compensate for reduced ad revenue per spot, platforms would simply increase the frequency of ads, showing more 5-second skippable ads per session. One user humorously compared this potential future to "Burma Shave" roadside signs, where a series of short ads would be presented sequentially. However, another user pointed out that the "skip" action itself provides valuable data for advertisers, as it confirms a real human interacted with the ad, suggesting platforms still gain value from this model.

There was also a discussion on the effectiveness of the regulation. Some commenters were skeptical that it would meaningfully change user experience, while others noted that if platforms become too aggressive with ad frequency, it could simply drive more users to ad-blockers or VPNs. The context of Vietnam's internet environment was briefly mentioned, with one user noting that widespread censorship of other content might make users less likely to circumvent platform rules.

Finally, the conversation broadened into a philosophical critique of the advertising industry itself. Several users expressed a strong anti-ad sentiment, arguing that ads are inherently "poisonous" by creating artificial needs and fostering addictive service designs. This led to a discussion about alternative business models, with YouTube Premium being cited as a prime example of a service that users might pay for to escape ads. A user noted that the presence of a paid, ad-free tier is often a good barometer for whether a service provides genuine value.

## [Opus 4.5 is not the normal AI agent experience that I have had thus far](https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/opus-4-5-change-everything/)
**Score:** 649 | **Comments:** 899 | **ID:** 46515696

> **Article:** The article, by Burke Holland, describes his experience with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 as a significant leap in AI coding capabilities. He contrasts it with previous models, which he found to be "brittle." Holland details how he used Opus 4.5 to build several complex applications from scratch, including a CleanShot X clone and a Superwhisper clone, using only natural language prompts. He argues that the model's ability to handle complex logic, self-correct, and maintain context over long sessions has fundamentally changed his development workflow, shifting him from a "coder" to a "director" of AI agents. He concludes that this level of leverage is a paradigm shift for software creation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted and often skeptical view of the article's claims. A central theme is the tension between the model's impressive capabilities and its practical limitations. While some users share similar positive experiences, building personal utilities and increasing their leverage, others raise significant concerns about the quality and maintainability of the generated code. Critics argue that AI tends to over-engineer solutions, creating code that is difficult to debug and maintain, and that it lacks the real-world robustness needed for production environments, such as handling edge cases and security audits.

The conversation also explores the broader impact on the software engineering profession. The consensus is not that SWE jobs will disappear, but that the role will evolve. The analogy of the printing press is used to suggest that developers who embrace these tools will become vastly more productive, while the need for low-level technical skills will persist, especially for debugging and handling complex issues. There is also a counter-narrative that this trend is a response to "software enshittification," allowing users to build personalized tools to avoid ad-ridden, subscription-based commercial apps. Finally, a recurring point of skepticism is the lack of objective benchmarks, with many commenters viewing the hype as premature until the technology can be reliably measured against real-world business goals.

## [Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding: Build via the terminal from your phone](https://github.com/rberg27/doom-coding)
**Score:** 482 | **Comments:** 346 | **ID:** 46517458

> **Article:** The article, "Stop Doom Scrolling, Start Doom Coding," introduces a method for writing code on a smartphone by connecting to a remote development environment via a terminal. The author, rberg27, outlines a setup using an iOS/Android terminal app (like Blink), Tailscale for secure VPN access to a home server, and AI tools like Claude for code generation. The core idea is to leverage "dead time" (e.g., commuting, waiting in line) for productive coding, transforming the phone from a distraction device into a portable development tool. The project is presented as a GitHub repository with setup instructions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community had a mixed but largely constructive reaction to the idea. The discussion can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Practicality and Tooling:** Many users engaged with the technical aspects, offering suggestions to improve the workflow. Key recommendations included using `tmux` to keep sessions alive when the phone screen is off, and using tools like `bat` or Vim's diff mode for better code review in the terminal, as side-by-side diffs are difficult on a small screen. There was also a debate over which terminal apps provide the best scrolling experience with `tmux`.

*   **The "Why" vs. "Why Not":** A central debate emerged around the fundamental utility of coding on a phone. Some users, like FooBarWidget, questioned the premise, arguing that phone environments are too distracting and lack the focus required for complex work. They suggested that such "in-between time" is better used for exercise or rest. Others countered that for simple, incremental tasks, it can be a productive way to make progress during commutes or other idle moments.

*   **Security Concerns:** One commenter, OakNinja, raised a valid security point, warning the author that their demo screenshots might have exposed identifiable network information. The author acknowledged this and took immediate action to secure their network.

*   **Historical Context and Precedent:** Several users noted that coding on a phone isn't a new concept, pointing to developers who have used similar terminal-based setups for years, especially in regions where a laptop might be a luxury. The conversation also humorously drifted to the history of coding on limited hardware, from old time-share systems to early internet-less experiences.

## [65% of Hacker News posts have negative sentiment, and they outperform](https://philippdubach.com/standalone/hn-sentiment/)
**Score:** 473 | **Comments:** 446 | **ID:** 46512881

> **Article:** The article presents an analysis of sentiment in Hacker News posts and comments. Using a sentiment analysis model, the author finds that 65% of HN content has a negative sentiment. The analysis also reveals a performance correlation: posts with negative sentiment tend to receive more upvotes and comments than those with neutral or positive sentiment, suggesting that negativity is more engaging for the HN community.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the article was largely skeptical and meta-analytical, with many commenters feeling the conclusion was self-evident. The discussion revolved around several key points:

There was a strong consensus that negativity is a natural and even desirable component of genuine discourse. Commenters argued that critical thinking and skepticism are more likely to provoke discussion than simple agreement, which is often expressed only through an upvote. Some framed this as an evolutionary trait, where prioritizing threats and negative information is essential for survival.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the methodology of the analysis itself. One user questioned the validity of the data, noting that the reported average score of 35 seemed unusually high and suggesting the sample might be skewed towards more popular posts. The original author acknowledged this potential skew and welcomed the feedback, highlighting the value of the preprint review process.

The conversation also touched on the nature of engagement on HN. One user shared their own analysis, which found that "clickbaity" or controversial titles performed best, corroborating the article's findings. Another user humorously noted that the most optimal title for upvotes would be a false report of Richard Stallman's death. Overall, the community engaged with the findings not by refuting them, but by exploring the underlying reasons for this negativity bias and questioning the technical execution of the study.

## [Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?](https://akr.am/blog/posts/why-is-the-gmail-app-700-mb)
**Score:** 410 | **Comments:** 361 | **ID:** 46514692

> **Article:** The article, titled "Why is the Gmail app 700 MB?", poses the central question but fails to provide a definitive answer. It highlights the surprisingly large size of the Gmail app on iOS (approaching 800MB) compared to Apple's native Mail app and other email clients. The author speculates that the size is due to Google's development strategy: building apps using cross-platform frameworks that bundle their own runtimes and libraries, rather than relying on native iOS frameworks. This approach allows for shared codebases across platforms (like Android and iOS) but results in a much larger application footprint for iOS users. The article concludes by noting that Gmail is not the only offender, with other apps like Tesla and Crypto.com also exceeding 1GB in size.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals that the original article was widely perceived as superficial, merely stating the problem without offering any technical depth. The community quickly stepped in to provide the analysis readers were looking for.

The primary explanation offered is that large apps like Gmail bundle their own dependencies. On iOS, where developers cannot rely on the same shared system libraries that Apple uses for its own apps (like Mail), they must package everything the app needs. This is especially true for cross-platform frameworks (like those used by Google to write the app once for both Android and iOS), which add a significant runtime overhead. A user noted that even on Android, the app is large (175MB), suggesting the issue isn't exclusive to iOS.

Beyond the core framework issue, commenters identified several contributing factors:
*   **Feature Bloat:** The app is no longer just for email; it integrates Chat, Meet, and other services, each adding its own size.
*   **"Kitchen Sink" Development:** A developer argued that most bloat comes from accumulated, unpruned dependencies, third-party SDKs for tracking, and specific assets added over years without cleanup.
*   **AOT Compilation:** Some suggested that Ahead-Of-Time compilation for performance contributes a large chunk to the download size.
*   **Security & 2FA:** One user pointed to the app's increasing security role (e.g., handling 2FA codes) as a potential reason for added complexity, though others were skeptical this explained the scale of the bloat.

The discussion also clarified the distinction between disk space (the article's focus) and RAM usage, and dismissed conspiracy theories that Google bloats its iOS apps to drive cloud subscriptions or Apple hardware sales. The consensus is that the size is a result of modern development practices, cross-platform strategies, and a lack of optimization.

## [Volkswagen Brings Back Physical Buttons](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a69916699/volkswagen-interior-physical-buttons-return/)
**Score:** 360 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46514913

> **Article:** Volkswagen is reversing its trend of minimalist, screen-dominated interiors and is bringing back physical buttons and knobs. According to a Car and Driver article, the company's new models will feature dedicated controls for critical functions like volume, fan speed, and temperature. This decision is a direct response to customer feedback and criticism that contemporary VW interiors, particularly the ID.3 and Golf, had become too reliant on touch-sensitive haptic sliders and touchscreen menus, making basic functions difficult to operate without looking away from the road.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely applauds Volkswagen's decision, viewing it as a necessary correction to a misguided industry-wide trend of prioritizing aesthetics and cost-cutting over driver safety and usability. The consensus is that physical buttons and knobs are superior for in-car controls because they provide tactile feedback, allowing drivers to operate them by feel without taking their eyes off the road.

However, the discussion adds several layers of nuance. One user cautions that the solution isn't simply adding more buttons, but designing them well, citing their own experience with a cluttered and unintuitive button layout in a Toyota. Another point of contention is the sheer number of buttons on VW's new steering wheel, though a counterpoint notes this is consistent with their previous designs.

Many commenters place blame on Tesla for starting the minimalist, screen-only trend, which other manufacturers then copied without critical evaluation. A key argument against this trend is that Tesla's justification—preparing for a future of fully autonomous driving—is not applicable to conventional cars. It's also pointed out that the aviation industry, a field that heavily relies on human factors research, continues to use physical controls for critical functions, underscoring that the move away from them in cars is driven by cost and aesthetics, not safety. The conversation concludes with a few tangential wishes, such as a return to manual transmissions and mechanical gauges, and a suggestion for innovative hybrid controls.

## [Calling All Hackers: How money works (2024)](https://phrack.org/issues/71/17)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46518129

> **Article:** The article "Calling All Hackers: How money works" is a primer on finance and economics aimed at a technical audience. It frames financial systems as complex systems or "computers" that hackers can understand and optimize. The author covers core concepts like the time value of money, debt, interest rates, and inflation. It then moves into more complex topics like the structure of venture capital, startup financing (SAFEs, valuation), and the incentives that drive founders and investors. The central thesis is that hackers, with their analytical skills, are uniquely equipped to understand and navigate the world of finance, and that doing so is crucial for building impactful things and achieving personal financial freedom.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is highly polarized, splitting into three main camps.

One group of commenters praised the article for its accessibility and framing. They felt the author successfully translated complex financial topics into a language that developers could understand, with one user noting, "Markets are computers; they compute prices... Hackers are good at computers. Let's learn more about it." This camp appreciated the high-level overview and the practical takeaways for founders and those interested in the startup world.

A significant counter-argument criticized the article for being overly simplistic, superficial, and occasionally inaccurate. Detractors argued that the author, while likely a skilled hacker, lacked a deep understanding of finance, with one user dismissing it as "How water works' from someone who only knows faucets." Specific critiques included misrepresentations of banking and accounting principles. This camp suggested that readers seeking a real understanding of money should look to more established works, like David Graeber's "Debt."

Finally, a prominent sub-discussion emerged around the article's mention of founders feeling like they are "wasting their twenties." This sparked a broader conversation about work-life balance, purpose, and privilege. Commenters debated whether this feeling is unique to founders or is a universal experience for people in their twenties, regardless of their career path. The discussion highlighted that the ability to even choose between a "safe" job and the high-risk life of a founder is a form of privilege, and that many jobs are both demanding and unfulfilling.

## [A 30B Qwen model walks into a Raspberry Pi and runs in real time](https://byteshape.com/blogs/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507/)
**Score:** 279 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46518573

> **Article:** The article from ByteShape details running the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507 model, a 30 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB of RAM. Using a heavily quantized version (Q3_K_S at 2.70 bits per weight), the author achieved a throughput of 8.03 tokens per second while maintaining 94.18% of the model's original BF16 performance across standard benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU, IFEVAL, LiveCodeBench). The post highlights this as a significant milestone for running powerful, modern LLMs on low-cost, low-power edge hardware in a responsive, "real-time" manner.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical feasibility of the benchmark, the practical applications of local, private AI, and the broader hardware ecosystem.

Several users clarified the technical details, noting that the "30B" model is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model where only 3B parameters are active at any given time, which explains the high speed on a CPU. The "94% accuracy" claim was clarified as being based on a composite of standard benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU, etc.) rather than just perplexity. A user attempting to replicate the results on a Raspberry Pi 5 initially ran into memory errors but resolved them by reducing the context size with the `-c 4096` flag, confirming the benchmark's viability.

A major theme was the desire for a private, local, "Alexa-like" home assistant ecosystem. One user described a conceptual three-tier system (interactive devices, a home server, and inference engines) that prioritizes privacy and interoperability, lamenting the lack of a simple, plug-and-play solution. Others agreed, mentioning their use of Home Assistant and the challenges of creating a smooth, real-time voice experience without cloud dependencies.

Finally, the conversation touched on the future of hardware for local inference. While some argued for the need for dedicated inference chips (NPUs) to be built into all computers, others pointed to existing ARM-based boards that already include them. The discussion also included recommendations for other models that can run on consumer hardware and resources for comparing model performance.

**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 163 | **ID:** 46514282

> **Article:** The "State of the Fin 2026-01-06" post is a progress report from the Jellyfin team. It details the recent 10.11.0 release, which was a major update that caused some initial friction for users upgrading from previous versions. The team has since released several point updates to address migration and general bugs. The post highlights ongoing development efforts, including progress on a native Samsung TV client (which is currently in Samsung's app review process) and other client improvements. It serves as a transparent update on the project's health, challenges, and forward momentum.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive towards Jellyfin, largely framed as a reaction to growing dissatisfaction with Plex. The primary catalyst for users exploring alternatives is Plex's perceived shift from a personal media server to a streaming service, coupled with unpopular changes to its cost model.

Key themes in the conversation include:

*   **Plex's Market Misstep:** Many commenters feel Plex has lost its way, prioritizing streaming features over its core function as a robust media server. This, combined with new costs for remote access, has pushed users to seek open-source alternatives.
*   **The "Plex to Jellyfin" Migration:** Several users share their success stories of switching. While some note that Plex still has a more polished client experience, the consensus is that Jellyfin is rapidly catching up and is a powerful, viable replacement.
*   **Homelab Catalyst:** The switch to Jellyfin is often described as the "first snowball" in a larger journey of self-hosting. Users detail how setting up Jellyfin inspired them to build a full homelab with services like Navidrome (music), a NAS, and reverse proxies.
*   **Client-Specific Challenges:** A recurring point of discussion is the state of client apps. There is significant frustration with the lack of a native Samsung TV app, though it's noted that one is in development. For Apple TV users, the official `Swiftfin` client and the third-party `Infuse` app are presented as excellent solutions.
*   **Feature Parity and Contribution:** While many are happy to move to Jellyfin, some long-time users acknowledge that Plex still holds a feature advantage. This has inspired a desire in some to contribute to the Jellyfin project to help close the gap.

## [My Snapdragon Dev Kit was healthy and working fine until a Windows update failed](https://jasoneckert.github.io/myblog/how-microsoft-killed-my-snapdragon-devkit/)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46521860

> **Article:** The author, Jason Eckert, details how his Microsoft Snapdragon Dev Kit, a small ARM-based PC for developers, became unusable after a Windows update failed. The device, which was working perfectly, entered a boot loop and became unresponsive after the update process. The author attempts various troubleshooting steps, including reseating hardware components, but is unable to revive the machine. He concludes that the Windows update process was responsible for bricking his device, highlighting the precarious state of the Windows on ARM ecosystem and the poor support for what is now a discontinued product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is divided on the author's conclusion, with the primary debate centering on whether the issue was a software failure caused by Microsoft or a hardware failure that coincidentally occurred during the update.

A significant portion of commenters argue that the symptoms described—specifically the random, unpredictable nature of the boot failures—are more indicative of a hardware fault than a software issue. They suggest that failing RAM or a faulty SSD controller are the most likely culprits. Several users shared personal anecdotes of similar issues being resolved by replacing hardware. However, other commenters counter that the timing is too coincidental to be dismissed, and that they have heard of similar problems affecting other users of this specific dev kit.

There is also a strong consensus regarding the broader context of the device itself. Many commenters point out that the Snapdragon Dev Kit was cancelled by Qualcomm and has reached its end-of-life, meaning it receives no official software or hardware support. This leads to a general sentiment of "I told you so," with users expressing that investing in such experimental, non-standard hardware was a risky proposition from the start. The discussion broadens to a critique of the entire Windows on ARM platform and Qualcomm's historical lack of robust driver and Linux support, with some commenters stating they would never buy a non-Apple ARM PC that couldn't reliably run Linux.

## [Passing of Joe Mancuso](https://github.com/MasoniteFramework/masonite/discussions/853)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 17 | **ID:** 46516137

> **Article:** The article is a post in the Masonite Python web framework's GitHub discussions, announcing the passing of its creator and lead developer, Joe Mancuso. The post is a tribute from his peers, noting that he was actively contributing to the project until the very end. It serves as an obituary for a respected figure in the open-source community.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a respectful and somber reflection on Joe Mancuso's passing, with commenters expressing condolences and sharing their thoughts. A key theme is the shock at his young age, which is noted by several users. The conversation quickly expands beyond the immediate announcement.

A significant portion of the discussion is dedicated to identifying the individual. One commenter found a GoFundMe page for a "Coach Joe Mancuso" who passed away at a similar age, and others confirmed the profile pictures matched. This led to speculation about the cause of death, with one user sharing a personal story about a friend who developed brain tumors after burning electronics (including iPads) in Afghanistan, suggesting a possible connection to burn pits and environmental exposure.

The discussion also touches on broader themes of legacy and mortality. One commenter poignantly reflects on how code serves as a "monument" that can outlive its creator, allowing a developer to share their "feeling of alignment" with others even after death. This sparked a side debate on whether code can be considered "beautiful" like art, with one user arguing that software's primary function makes it a means to an end for most people, unlike art which is often appreciated purely for its aesthetics. Finally, there was practical concern from a developer who had just discovered Masonite and wondered if the project would continue, to which the response was that its MIT license ensures it can live on.

## [Video Game Websites in the early 00s](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/exhibitions/video-game-websites-in-the-early-00s)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46516559

> **Article:** The article from Web Design Museum is a visual exhibition showcasing the design of video game websites from the early 2000s. It features screenshots of classic sites like Nintendo, Newgrounds, MiniClip, and PlanetQuake, highlighting the era's distinct aesthetic characterized by high information density, pixel art, Flash-based interactivity, and complex, themed layouts that mirrored the games they promoted.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a wave of nostalgia, with users fondly recalling specific websites like Newgrounds, MiniClip, and PlanetQuake. A key theme is the contrast between the dense, creative, and often Flash-driven designs of the past and the more uniform, mobile-first web of today. Several commenters argue that the shift to mobile devices and the decline of technologies like Flash led to a loss of creative freedom and visual richness. The Nintendo 2k1 website is specifically praised as a masterclass in pixel-perfect, table-based slicing. While some debate the technical merits of old methods like the `<map>` tag, the consensus is that the era's constraints (like fixed screen sizes) enabled a unique form of artistic expression that is largely missing from the modern web.

## [Oral microbiome sequencing after taking probiotics](https://blog.booleanbiotech.com/oral-microbiome-biogaia)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46518804

> **Article:** The article is a personal science blog post detailing an experiment to test the effectiveness of a specific oral probiotic, BioGaia Gastrus tablets (which contain *Lactobacillus reuteri*). The author used 16S rRNA sequencing via the low-cost service Plasmidsaurus to analyze their oral microbiome before, during, and after taking the probiotics. The primary finding was that the target *L. reuteri* strain did not appear to colonize or establish itself in the author's mouth, as its presence remained at baseline levels. The author also observed significant day-to-day variation in their oral microbiome composition, suggesting it is a dynamic ecosystem. The post concludes that, for this author, the probiotic did not have the intended effect on the oral microbiome, though they may continue taking it for other potential benefits or for the taste.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the accessibility of citizen science, the challenges of interpreting personal microbiome data, and broader frustrations with the medical system's handling of gut and oral health.

Several commenters were enthusiastic about the feasibility of such an experiment, highlighting the low cost of services like Plasmidsaurus and nanopore sequencing as an empowering trend for hobbyists and bloggers. Technical discussion also touched on the analysis tools used, such as the Emu pipeline for 16S ribosomal RNA analysis.

A significant theme was the difficulty of drawing firm conclusions from self-experimentation. Multiple users pointed out the lack of a control period (sequencing the microbiome without the probiotic) as a major flaw, making it impossible to distinguish the probiotic's effect from natural daily variations or other lifestyle factors. This skepticism was framed as a common issue in biohacking, where people often misinterpret normal fluctuations as being caused by an intervention.

The conversation broadened into personal stories about the difficulties of managing gut health issues like SIBO and H. pylori. Many commenters expressed frustration with doctors who are hesitant to investigate microbiome-related problems, citing the "messy" and inconclusive state of the science. This led to a shared sentiment that patients often have to take matters into their own hands, though this path carries the risk of falling for unsubstantiated claims. Finally, there was some practical debate about the efficacy and storage of probiotics, with one user arguing that shelf-stable probiotics are generally ineffective, while another mentioned the potential of newer "spore-based" strains.

## [Firefox extension to redirect x.com to xcancel.com](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toxcancel/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 127 | **ID:** 46524873

> **Article:** The article links to a Firefox browser extension called "ToXCancel" available on the Mozilla Add-ons store. Its sole function is to automatically redirect any `x.com` (formerly Twitter) URLs to their equivalent on `xcancel.com`, a privacy-focused front-end for the platform that removes tracking and improves the user experience for logged-out users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response to the extension is largely positive, with users expressing appreciation for Firefox-exclusive tools and the ability to avoid the official X.com platform. A recurring theme is the frustration with the poor user experience for logged-out users on X.com, which drives the need for such tools.

Several users point out that this is part of a broader trend of "alternative front-ends" for privacy and usability. A popular alternative mentioned is LibRedirect, a more comprehensive extension that handles redirects for multiple services (including X and Instagram). For users wary of installing extensions, commenters provide alternative methods like a custom Tampermonkey script or a browser bookmarklet that performs the same URL manipulation.

The discussion also touches on the disconnect between users who decry surveillance but use Chrome, with Firefox users feeling like a minority. There is also a minor concern that publicizing these workarounds might lead the official service to block them.

## [High-Performance DBMSs with io_uring: When and How to use it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04859)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46517319

> **Article:** The paper "High-Performance DBMSs with io_uring: When and How to use it" provides a practical guide for database architects on leveraging Linux's `io_uring` for significant performance gains. The authors argue that `io_uring` is not a simple drop-in replacement for traditional I/O calls but requires a fundamental architectural shift. The key benefits stem from its unified interface for both storage and network I/O, true asynchronous operations, and efficient batching.

The paper outlines a step-by-step approach: first, confirm I/O is the bottleneck; second, redesign the application for async/batching; and only then, adopt advanced `io_uring` features like zero-copy, fixed buffers, and polling. It highlights that a "thread-per-core" model with dedicated rings per thread is optimal, allowing computation and I/O to overlap within the same thread. The research demonstrates substantial throughput improvements in a DBMS context, especially when using features like IOPOLL (for storage) and NVMe passthrough, but stresses these come with specific trade-offs and constraints.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the paper for its clarity and practical value. Key themes included:

*   **Architectural Guidance:** Commenters appreciated the paper's core message that `io_uring` is an architectural tool, not a simple optimization. The guidelines to first prove I/O is the bottleneck and then redesign for async/batching were highlighted as particularly useful.

*   **Advanced Feature Nuances:** A detailed technical exchange clarified the use of `io_uring`'s polling modes. Users learned that `IOPOLL` (for storage) and `SQPOLL` (for submission) are not mutually exclusive and that `IOPOLL` typically requires a separate ring from network I/O. The consensus is that a thread-per-core model with dedicated rings is the best practice.

*   **Deployment and Security Concerns:** A major practical point was the availability of `io_uring`. It was clarified that while `io_uring` is often blocked in containerized environments (like Docker) and some cloud sandboxes due to security risks, it is fully available on virtual machines from major cloud providers, enabling experimentation.

*   **Correction on Durable Writes:** A significant correction was made regarding the paper's claim that enterprise SSDs don't require `fsync`. Commenters pointed out this was incorrect; `fsync` is still essential to guarantee data has reached persistent storage, even if the drive's internal power-loss protection (PLP) prevents data loss *after* a write is acknowledged.

*   **Library Support:** A user noted that advanced features like NVMe passthrough can be difficult to use due to lagging support in various language-specific libraries, with `liburing` being the most up-to-date reference implementation.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this e-nose technology is multifaceted, ranging from technical analysis to personal, anecdotal experiences.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the technical aspects and accessibility of the technology. One user provided an in-depth analysis of the underlying sensor technology, linking to several research papers that explore how adding graphene to tin oxide sensors improves their sensitivity and allows them to operate at room temperature. There was also interest in the commercial availability of such sensors, with one user mentioning a spin-off company (SMELLDECT GmbH) from a research project, though noted it's not a simple off-the-shelf purchase. The difficulty of creating artificial senses like smell compared to sight was also a topic, with users noting that detecting molecules is far more complex than detecting photons.

The discussion also explored practical applications. Users suggested it could be a game-changer for industrial clean rooms, where microbial monitoring is currently slow and tedious. The idea of using the sensor on a drone for a "full-house scan" was also proposed as a way for homeowners to conduct their own assessments without hiring expensive experts.

A particularly poignant and detailed personal story emerged from a user concerned about their mother's house, which had developed a strange smell concurrent with her diagnosis of vascular dementia. They suspected a toxic environmental factor like mold might be contributing to her symptoms and were seeking affordable testing solutions. This prompted a supportive but sobering exchange where other users shared similar experiences with elderly relatives, suggesting that changes in body chemistry and hygiene, rather than an external environmental factor, are often the cause of such odors in dementia patients.

Finally, some users offered alternative or skeptical viewpoints, such as using negative ion generators to control mold, while others discussed the limitations of current consumer-grade mold testing kits, which often rely on simple microscopy or culture growth, lacking the precision of a PCR-based or e-nose approach.

## [Why the trans flag emoji is the 5-codepoint sequence it is](https://hecate.pink/blog/2026/trans-flag-emoji/)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46520879

> **Article:** The article "Why the trans flag emoji is the 5-codepoint sequence it is" explains the technical history behind the transgender flag emoji. It details how the flag is not a single, dedicated codepoint, but a "sequence" composed of the white flag emoji (U+1F3F3), a variation selector (U+FE0F), a zero-width joiner (U+200D), and the transgender symbol (U+26A7). The author explains that this construction was necessary because the Unicode Consortium has a strong policy against adding new country or region flags, and by extension, most other flags. To get the trans flag approved, proponents had to use existing characters in a sequence that would be rendered as a single glyph by modern operating systems. The article also touches on the history of emoji in Unicode, noting that they were added largely at the behest of Japanese tech companies, and discusses how this sequence-based approach allows for the creation of new flags without needing to create new codepoints, thus bypassing the Consortium's strict policies.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is split between technical appreciation for the article's subject matter and significant debate over its presentation and accessibility. A primary theme is the article's highly stylized website, which features a pink/black color scheme and animated background particles. Several users found this design difficult to read and praised the use of browser "reader mode" to make the content accessible. This sparked a sub-discussion on web design philosophy, with some commenters arguing that authors should cater to all users, while others defended the author's right to creative expression on a personal blog.

Technically, the community was fascinated by the ingenuity of the emoji sequence and the politics of the Unicode Consortium. Users discussed how this "shoehorning" technique is a practical way to get new symbols adopted without official approval. There was also a broader conversation about the role of emoji in Unicode, with some arguing that flags and pictograms are a departure from Unicode's core mission of text encoding, while others explained that emoji support was a necessary addition to accommodate a feature that was already popular in Japan via non-standard encodings. Finally, a notable point of contention arose when one user admitted to using ChatGPT to summarize the article, which was criticized by others as an over-reliance on AI when simpler tools like reader mode were available.

## [Locating a Photo of a Vehicle in 30 Seconds with GeoSpy](https://geospy.ai/blog/locating-a-photo-of-a-vehicle-in-30-seconds-with-geospy)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46515948

> **Article:** The article from GeoSpy.ai demonstrates a tool that uses AI to geolocate a photo of a vehicle in under 30 seconds. The process involves the user uploading a photo of a car, and the AI analyzes visual clues—such as the vehicle's make and model, background scenery, road signs, and vegetation—to pinpoint its location on a map. The post frames this as a solution for locating stolen vehicles, noting that thieves often post photos of them for sale on online marketplaces. It claims the tool can bypass common obfuscation tactics used by criminals, such as removing license plates or taking photos in nondescript garages, by analyzing the surrounding environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the GeoSpy tool is dominated by concerns about privacy, potential for misuse, and skepticism about its practical applications. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the dystopian implications of such technology. Commenters draw parallels to existing surveillance systems like Flock (automated license plate reader networks) and ALPRs, suggesting this tool could be used by repo agents or law enforcement to track individuals without warrants, leading to a "surveillance state" scenario. The potential for misuse by stalkers, abusers, or other malicious actors is a recurring and serious concern, with many arguing that such powerful technology should be illegal or at least strictly regulated.

On the other hand, some users debate the article's premise regarding how stolen cars are sold. While the original post claims thieves use Facebook Marketplace, some commenters find this unbelievable. However, others provide evidence that this is indeed a common method, not just for cars but also for stolen bikes, often using anonymous accounts.

Finally, there is a layer of skepticism about the technology itself. Some users question the novelty, suggesting it's an impressive but not entirely new application of AI. Others point out the practical challenge of obtaining a photo of the stolen vehicle in the first place, while one commenter humorously notes that the demo is redundant because they can already identify locations from photos without AI. The discussion also briefly touches on the company's patriotic marketing language, with commenters expressing cynicism and calling for oversight rather than uncritical praise.

## [Self hosting my media library with Jellyfin and Wireguard on Hetzner](https://layandreas.github.io/personal-blog/posts/how-spotify-made-me-self-host/)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46517636

> **Article:** The article, "Self hosting my media library with Jellyfin and Wireguard on Hetzner," details a personal journey away from Spotify towards self-hosting a media library. The author expresses frustration with Spotify's business practices, rising subscription costs, and the feeling of not truly owning their music. The post is a technical guide explaining how they set up their own media server using Jellyfin (an open-source media server) on a Hetzner cloud VPS, and secured it with a Wireguard VPN for remote access. The solution provides them with full control, privacy, and ownership over their media collection, framed as a response to the shortcomings of corporate streaming platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the central tension between the convenience of streaming services and the principles of ownership, artist compensation, and technical control.

A primary theme is the debate over the practicality and economics of self-hosting. One side argues that for music discovery and keeping up with new releases, streaming services are unparalleled. They point out that the cost of a single purchased album can be equivalent to a month of unlimited access, making streaming a better value for exploratory listeners. The counter-argument, rooted in artist support, is that streaming pays artists fractions of a cent, whereas direct purchases (even of used CDs) provide far more meaningful financial support. Some users argue that the streaming ecosystem as a whole devalues music and harms the ability to fund quality content.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on anti-consumer and anti-artist practices at Spotify. Users cited specific grievances, including the use of "ghost artists" to reduce royalty payments, a new policy not to pay for songs with fewer than 1,000 plays, the proliferation of AI-generated music, and the CEO's investments in AI weaponry, leading some to advocate for a boycott.

Technical implementation was also a key topic. Users shared various methods for self-hosting, from full media servers like Jellyfin and Navidrome to simpler solutions like a direct NFS share. Practical advice was offered on how to stream to mobile devices, with recommendations for apps like Symfonium for Android and mentions of custom-built solutions for iOS, often using a VPN like Wireguard or Tailscale for secure access. The discussion also included alternative models like the artist co-op Resonate.

## [Dude, where's my supersonic jet?](https://rationaloptimistsociety.substack.com/p/dude-wheres-my-supersonic-jet)
**Score:** 121 | **Comments:** 271 | **ID:** 46515936

> **Article:** The article "Dude, where's my supersonic jet?" laments the lack of commercial supersonic travel, arguing that technological progress has stagnated. It frames the issue as a failure of imagination and regulation, highlighting the startup Boom Supersonic as a potential solution. The author proposes a "Supersonic 2.0" model where supersonic flights become accessible, not just a luxury for the ultra-wealthy. A key example cited is Boom's pitch to airlines: replace the business class cabin of a standard wide-body jet with a smaller supersonic plane, offering the same passengers a much faster flight for the same price, thereby capturing the airline's most profitable segment more efficiently.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's premise, focusing on economic, practical, and technological realities. A central theme is the questionable market demand for supersonic travel. Commenters argue that the time saved is often marginal compared to the total door-to-door journey time, and that for those who truly value speed, private jets are already an option. Furthermore, they point out that if there were a large, untapped market between current and supersonic speeds, airlines would have already exploited it.

The economic viability of Boom's business model was heavily criticized. One user pointed out a major flaw in the article's core example: if an airline replaces its profitable business class section with a supersonic plane, it loses the majority of its revenue from that route, which would necessitate raising prices for economy passengers to compensate.

Technical and historical skepticism was also prevalent. Users questioned the accuracy of the article's claims about the Concorde's fuel consumption, noting that while it was inefficient, the specific "52% for taxiing" figure was likely a misinterpretation. The environmental impact, though not mentioned in the original article, was raised as a significant regulatory and cost hurdle. The discussion also highlighted the challenges beyond the plane itself, such as the need for specialized supersonic airports and the fact that overland supersonic flight remains prohibited in the US.

Finally, the conversation touched upon the nature of technological progress itself. Some commenters argued that true progress isn't about raw speed but about efficiency ("doing more with less"), and that modern innovations like in-flight Wi-Fi have made travel more productive in ways that supersonic speed does not. The recent pivot by Boom to sell its engine technology for data center power generation was also mentioned as a sign of potential struggles in their primary aviation mission.
