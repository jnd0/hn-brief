## [Cloudflare CEO on the Italy fines](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/2009654937303896492)
**Score:** 552 | **Comments:** 782 | **ID:** 46555760

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet by Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince regarding a fine imposed on Cloudflare by AGCOM, Italy's communications regulatory authority. In the tweet, Prince frames the fine as an attempt by "a shadowy cabal of European media elites" to censor the internet. He argues this is a fundamental unfair trade issue and thanks US Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk for their leadership on free speech, suggesting they are critical allies in fighting this type of regulation. He also mentions Cloudflare's pro-bono services for Italian cultural institutions and the upcoming 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, implicitly using them as leverage in the dispute.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Cloudflare's CEO, focusing on the perceived hypocrisy and political maneuvering in his statement. The dominant theme is the irony of Matthew Prince, the head of a powerful internet gatekeeper, positioning himself as a champion of an "open internet" while simultaneously praising figures like Elon Musk and JD Vance, who are seen by many commenters as threats to free speech themselves. Many view his praise of Musk and Vance not as a principled stand, but as a calculated political move to curry favor with the current US administration to resolve his company's legal issue in Europe.

A secondary, more nuanced discussion emerges about the specifics of the Italian fine. While some dismiss the CEO's "conspiracy" language, others provide context on AGCOM's reputation for petty fines and the broader European trend of granting media companies powerful anti-piracy tools (like Spain's La Liga or Italy's "Piracy Shield") that can cause widespread internet disruption. This context lends some credence to the idea that the regulation is problematic, even if the CEO's framing and chosen allies are widely disliked. Ultimately, the commenters are torn between their skepticism of Cloudflare's corporate motives and their general opposition to heavy-handed censorship and overreach by European regulators.

## [“Erdos problem #728 was solved more or less autonomously by AI”](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103)
**Score:** 492 | **Comments:** 266 | **ID:** 46560445

> **Article:** The post links to a Mathstodon update by mathematician Terence Tao, announcing that Erdős Problem #728 has been "solved more or less autonomously by AI." The solution was achieved using a specialized tool called "Aristotle," which works with the Lean theorem prover. Tao notes this is the first entry in a new "AI contributions to Erdős problems" wiki he is maintaining, marking a milestone in the formalization of mathematical proofs by AI.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is polarized between excitement for the new capabilities and skepticism regarding the nature of the achievement. Many commenters express awe at the potential for AI to accelerate mathematical research, particularly by "refactoring" existing proofs or exploring variations that would be too tedious for humans. This is seen as a new frontier for benchmarking AI, with some predicting that Millennium Prize Problems could be tackled by AI within the next decade.

However, several users challenge the "autonomous" claim in the title. They point out that Terence Tao's own description of the process reveals significant human involvement, including guiding the AI, identifying gaps, and iterating between different tools. This leads to a debate on whether the AI is truly "reasoning" or just performing advanced pattern matching and shuffling of existing proofs. The discussion also highlights a technical distinction: the tool used (Aristotle) is a specialized model for formal logic, not a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM), though some commenters conflated the two. Ultimately, while the achievement is acknowledged as a milestone, the level of human expertise required and the "autonomy" of the AI are points of contention.

## [The Vietnam government has banned rooted phones from using any banking app](https://xdaforums.com/t/discussion-the-root-and-mod-hiding-fingerprint-spoofing-keybox-stealing-cat-and-mouse-game.4425939/page-118)
**Score:** 491 | **Comments:** 571 | **ID:** 46555963

> **Article:** The article, based on a discussion on XDA Developers, reports that the Vietnamese government has mandated that all banking applications must detect and block access if the user's phone is rooted, has an unlocked bootloader, or has ADB enabled. The policy effectively bans users of modified Android systems from accessing mobile banking services in the country.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted debate on the Vietnamese government's ban of rooted phones from banking apps, centering on the tension between security, user freedom, and government control.

A primary theme is the rationale behind the ban. Some users argue it is a standard security precaution by risk-averse banks to prevent fraud and reduce liability. However, the consensus leans towards the policy being an overreach, with many questioning why the government would care so deeply. The most compelling explanation points to political control, citing Vietnam's authoritarian context and the ongoing rollout of the VNeID project, a national digital identity system that aims to link citizens' biometrics, devices, and financial activities.

The practical impact on users is another key point. While a simple solution is to use two phones—one for banking and one for personal use—commenters point out the financial and logistical burdens of this approach. A significant counter-argument is that many users root their phones not for malicious purposes, but to run custom ROMs that extend the life of older devices that are no longer supported by the manufacturer, a practice that reduces e-waste.

The discussion also explores the technical and philosophical aspects of the issue. Some users note the irony that banks likely allow access from rooted desktop computers via web browsers. A more cynical view posits that the distinction is irrelevant because modern smartphones are not truly personal computers but controlled terminals, a trend being accelerated by both governments and tech giants like Apple and Google. Ultimately, the conversation concludes with a sense of futility, as commenters predict that future security measures, such as hardware-level key provisioning, will make bypassing these restrictions nearly impossible for the average user.

## [Show HN: I made a memory game to teach you to play piano by ear](https://lend-me-your-ears.specr.net)
**Score:** 485 | **Comments:** 163 | **ID:** 46556210

> **Project:** The project is a web-based application called "Lend Me Your Ears" designed to teach users how to play the piano by ear. It functions as a memory game, similar to "Simon Says," where the user must listen to a sequence of notes and then replicate it. The application supports MIDI controllers for input and provides a visual representation of the notes on a musical staff, aiming to improve the user's "hand-ear coordination" and aural skills.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the project was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising its simplicity and effectiveness. A major point of discussion was the input method. Several users requested the ability to use a standard computer keyboard, with one commenter providing a detailed layout from music tracker software that allows for over two octaves. Another suggestion was to add an on-screen keyboard for mouse interaction.

Technical feedback included a bug report from a user whose MIDI keyboard triggered a note both on press and release. This prompted a detailed explanation from another user about how different MIDI keyboards handle NOTE_ON and NOTE_OFF events (specifically, using a zero-velocity NOTE_ON instead of a NOTE_OFF message), which the developer acknowledged. Other feature requests included microphone support for acoustic instruments (though another user noted the significant technical challenge this would pose), a pause button for exploration, and adjustable difficulty levels. Some users also discussed the app's broader utility for sight-singing training and for users with specific conditions like perfect pitch but poor working memory.

## [Flock Hardcoded the Password for America's Surveillance Infrastructure 53 Times](https://nexanet.ai/blog/53-times-flocksafety-hardcoded-the-password-for-americas-surveillance-infrastructure)
**Score:** 451 | **Comments:** 146 | **ID:** 46555807

> **Article:** The article from Nexanet.ai alleges that Flock Safety, a major provider of automated license plate reader (ALPR) cameras to US law enforcement, has systemic security failures. The central claim is that Flock hardcoded a sensitive API key in their firmware, which was exposed in 53 different camera installations. This key allegedly provided access to a surveillance data aggregation platform, effectively a "backdoor" into America's surveillance infrastructure. The author details a responsible disclosure timeline, stating they notified Flock in November 2025, but the vulnerability remained unpatched as of January 2026 (55+ days later). The article frames this not as an isolated incident but as a pattern of credential mismanagement and negligence by a company that has rapidly deployed surveillance technology across the country.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Flock Safety, with commenters expressing a mix of outrage, cynicism, and weary familiarity with the security failures of well-funded tech companies. The dominant sentiment is that this is a catastrophic failure of basic security hygiene, not a sophisticated hack. One commenter notes the irony of Flock's frequent PR claim that they have "never been hacked," arguing that leaving a door wide open should still count as a security breach.

There is a strong consensus that this represents a failure of corporate culture and priorities rather than just technical incompetence. Many believe the company simply did not care enough about security to implement basic best practices, a point underscored by the fact that they only recently began hiring senior security leadership. This is seen as a classic case of "move fast and break things" being applied to sensitive surveillance infrastructure, with one commenter darkly noting that dystopian tech seems less scary to executives when they believe they will be the ones controlling it.

The discussion also touches on the broader societal implications. Commenters lament the ease with which companies like Flock and ShotSpotter sell expensive, insecure surveillance systems to local governments, often bypassing technical scrutiny. There's a debate about the ethics of public camera feeds, with some arguing they should be public for transparency, while others warn this enables stalking and contributes to a "crowdsourced police state." The poor quality of the article itself (which is suspected to be AI-generated) was also a point of criticism, as it made the timeline of the vulnerability's status unclear.

## [Kagi releases alpha version of Orion for Linux](https://help.kagi.com/orion/misc/linux-status.html)
**Score:** 396 | **Comments:** 280 | **ID:** 46553343

> **Article:** Kagi has released an alpha version of its Orion web browser for Linux. Orion is a browser built on the WebKit engine, which is notable for not being a Chromium or Firefox fork. The release is currently in a closed alpha, available only to "Orion+ supporters" who can download it from their Kagi billing dashboard. The company has not yet announced a timeline for a wider public release or for Android/Windows versions.
>
> **Discussion:** The announcement generated a mixed but interested response from the Hacker News community. A central point of discussion was the choice of WebKit as the rendering engine. Users speculated this was likely for easier cross-platform consistency, especially given Apple's restriction of all iOS browsers to WebKit, and some suggested it might be simpler to work with than Firefox's Gecko engine.

Several commenters expressed frustration with the current state of browser choice on other platforms. One user lamented the inability to use Kagi search as a default in Safari on iOS due to Apple's restrictive extension policies, while another noted the irony of a closed-source browser being released on the open-source Linux platform.

There was also confusion and feedback regarding the release's accessibility. Some users couldn't find a download link and were disappointed to learn it was limited to paying Orion+ supporters. While many praised Kagi for innovation and for not creating "yet another Chrome clone," there was a clear desire from users for the company to expand its browser to Android.

## [Exercise can be nearly as effective as therapy for depression](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225516.htm)
**Score:** 352 | **Comments:** 288 | **ID:** 46557233

> **Article:** The article, based on a Cochrane Review, posits that exercise is a highly effective intervention for depression, potentially rivaling established treatments like psychotherapy and medication. The review analyzed 57 trials and found a significant reduction in depressive symptoms among participants who exercised. The article frames this as a powerful, accessible, and low-cost option for managing mental health, highlighting that physical activity can trigger neurochemical changes that alleviate depression.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted and often skeptical view of the article's claims. While many users shared personal anecdotes of exercise successfully alleviating their depression, the conversation quickly delved into the practical and scientific complexities.

A central theme is the "chicken-and-egg" problem: depression saps the motivation required to start exercising, creating a difficult barrier to overcome. However, commenters offered practical advice, suggesting that starting small—like a short daily walk—is more manageable than a daunting gym routine and can build momentum naturally.

The discussion also included a significant critique of the study's statistical presentation. One user, D-Machine, argued that the effect size (SMD of -0.67) is a statistical metric without inherent clinical meaning. They introduced the concept of the "Minimal Clinically Important Difference" (MCID), suggesting that for a treatment's effect to be meaningful, it must be noticeable to the patient. They posited that if exercise is only "nearly as effective" as therapy, and therapy itself is often only borderline effective according to some metrics, the actual benefit of exercise might be too small to be clinically observable for many.

Personal experiences were varied and highlighted the complexity of depression. Some users linked their mental state to physical conditions like diabetes, finding that managing blood sugar through exercise improved their mood. Others shared success stories of stopping medication in favor of exercise and lifestyle changes. Conversely, a few users reported that even significant weight loss and intense exercise routines failed to improve their deep depression, with one suggesting that underlying trauma might be the root cause. The debate over medication versus lifestyle was also present, with some defending antidepressants as a necessary tool for chemical imbalances, while others warned against offering simplistic advice like "just exercise" to people in severe depressive states.

## [London–Calcutta bus service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%E2%80%93Calcutta_bus_service)
**Score:** 341 | **Comments:** 170 | **ID:** 46554462

> **Article:** The Wikipedia article details the historic London–Calcutta bus service, which operated from 1957 to 1976. Run by a company named "Travel Links International," the journey was an overland trip covering approximately 12,000 miles. It was designed as a budget alternative to flying, taking about 50 days to complete. The service included stops at various tourist sites and provided accommodation in hotels along the route. A one-way ticket cost £85 in 1957 (equivalent to roughly £1,800-£2,600 in modern value depending on the inflation calculator used), rising to £145 by 1973. The service ceased due to political instability, specifically the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 and the subsequent closure of the Pakistan-India border, which made the route impossible to maintain.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion among Hacker News users revolves around the nostalgia for this era of travel, the economics of the journey, and the feasibility of such a trip today. Many commenters expressed amazement at the time commitment required—50 days on a bus—and the adventurous nature of overland travel in the mid-20th century.

Several users shared historical context and personal anecdotes. One user noted that a friend utilized the route in the 1970s not just for travel, but to live off the favorable exchange rate of UK unemployment benefits while in India. Others reminisced about the ease of travel before World War I, when passports were not always required in Europe, though this sparked a counter-debate about the significant improvements in modern medicine, safety, and infrastructure.

There was a lively debate regarding the cost of the service. While the Wikipedia article cited a price equivalent to over £2,500 today, a user pointed out that the Bank of England's official inflation calculator suggested a lower figure of around £1,800. Regardless, users agreed that £50 per day for an all-inclusive trip was relatively reasonable compared to modern travel costs.

Finally, the conversation touched on the geopolitical realities that ended the service. Users highlighted that the route is currently impossible due to closed borders and conflict zones (specifically mentioning Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan). The thread concluded with comparisons to other long-distance bus services, such as the American "Green Tortoise," and general agreement that while travel is faster today, the "golden age" of overland adventure had a unique appeal.

## [How Markdown took over the world](https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/09/how-markdown-took-over-the-world/)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 232 | **ID:** 46556695

> **Article:** The article "How Markdown took over the world" by Anil Dash argues that Markdown's success was not inevitable, but the result of specific historical timing and a "worse is better" philosophy. It emerged in the mid-2000s as a simple, human-readable alternative to complex and intimidating publishing formats like DocBook and the steep learning curve of HTML. Markdown's key advantage was being both the source and the destination—it was readable even in its raw form. The author also provides historical context, noting that Markdown and its competitor, Textile, were launched simultaneously on the Movable Type platform, creating a real-world A/B test where Markdown ultimately won. The piece frames Markdown's victory as a shift towards pragmatism and simplicity over feature-heavy complexity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely affirms the article's thesis, focusing on Markdown's simplicity and historical context. A central theme is the "worse is better" argument, where users celebrated Markdown for being intuitive and usable in its native form, contrasting it with the "horrible user experience" of verbose formats like DocBook. The conversation also delves into Markdown's imperfections, with one commenter ironically highlighting an ambiguity in the article itself, sparking a debate on the semantic difference between `<em>` (emphasis) and `<i>` (italics).

Historically, commenters expanded on the article's sidebars, discussing the now-obscure competitor Textile and the political blogosphere of the early 2000s. Looking forward, some users see Markdown as a stepping stone, advocating for newer systems like Typst, which they argue combines Markdown's simplicity with the power of LaTeX. A final point of debate was whether browsers should natively render Markdown, with most agreeing it's unlikely due to the lack of a single, standardized specification.

## [Show HN: Scroll Wikipedia like TikTok](https://quack.sdan.io)
**Score:** 267 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46557029

> **Project:** The project, "Scroll Wikipedia like TikTok," is a web application that presents Wikipedia articles in a short-form, vertical video format. It uses AI to generate a "story" from a Wikipedia page, displaying text word-by-word with animations and background audio (including an Undertale track). The underlying technology uses Google's Gemini model via the AI SDK to generate the HTML and styling for each "story" on demand.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the project was mixed, with users split between appreciating the technical execution and questioning its practical utility. Several commenters noted that the concept is not new, pointing to similar projects like "WikTok" and "WikiTok" that appeared in 2023 and early 2025.

On the positive side, users praised the project's technical polish, specifically the animations and audio integration, which they felt differentiated it from other attempts. The use of generative UI was a point of interest, with the creator confirming they use a base set of CSS/JS that is injected on top of the HTML generated by Gemini.

However, the primary criticism was about the user experience and purpose. A major usability complaint was that the text appears one word at a time, which makes it difficult to read without audio. More fundamentally, several users argued that the project "enshittifies" knowledge, making it harder to absorb information effectively. This led to a broader debate on the value of "Just-In-Time" app generation versus creating more robust, human-in-the-loop tools. One commenter also shared a video of a similar concept using AI video generation, which another user described as "frictionless slop creation."

## [JavaScript Demos in 140 Characters](https://beta.dwitter.net)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46557489

> **Article:** The article links to "Dwitter," a social network and coding challenge site where users create and share JavaScript demos (often visual animations or games) that must fit within a strict 140-character limit. The site is a "code golf" platform that pushes developers to use extreme creativity and JavaScript tricks to create impressive visuals in a tiny amount of code.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the creative tension between the site's 140-character limit and the "meta-game" of cheating that has evolved around it. A major point of contention is the widespread use of `eval(unescape(...))` and similar tricks to pack large amounts of code into the limit by using multi-byte Unicode characters. Many commenters argue this violates the spirit of the challenge, though others defend it as a creative way to work within the system's rules.

Several solutions and alternative viewpoints were proposed:
*   **Changing the Metric:** Many suggest switching the limit from characters to bytes (specifically UTF-8) to neutralize the Unicode packing trick and align the score with the actual code size.
*   **The Platform's Role:** One commenter noted that the official beta site already has a "compressed" toggle that displays the true byte size, acknowledging the issue.
*   **The Value of Creativity:** A counter-argument was made that the "metagame" of stretching the rules is a creative and interesting challenge in itself, similar to the 4k demo scene.

Other notable topics included technical appreciation for the extreme compression methods used (like embedding binary data in HTML or PNGs), a user learning about JavaScript tagged template literals from the code examples, and a brief tangent on the technical limitations of the site's responsiveness on Safari.

## [RTX 5090 and Raspberry Pi: Can it game?](https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46558148

> **Article:** The article "RTX 5090 and Raspberry Pi: Can it game?" by Scott J. G. explores a highly unbalanced hardware setup: connecting a top-of-the-line NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU to a Raspberry Pi 5. The author's goal is to see if this combination can run modern, demanding games like *Cyberpunk 2077* and *Doom: The Dark Ages*.

The setup requires a PCIe adapter and an external power supply for the GPU. The author uses the FEX-Emu translation layer to run the x86_64 Linux games on the Pi's ARM64 architecture. The results are a mix of success and failure. While the Pi is a significant bottleneck, some games run surprisingly well, achieving playable (though low) frame rates. However, other titles fail due to issues with anti-cheat/DRM software (like Denuvo) or other compatibility hurdles. The author concludes that while technically impressive, it's not a practical gaming solution, but it demonstrates the power of modern Linux emulation tools like FEX and DXVK.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, touching on nostalgia, hardware practicality, and software compatibility. A prominent theme is nostalgia, with users fondly recalling the "Can it run Crysis?" meme and sharing stories of playing games like *Morrowind* on underpowered hardware from their youth, noting that low frame rates can be acceptable if one is "desperate enough."

The practicality of the Raspberry Pi itself is heavily debated. Several commenters argue that Pis have become too expensive and cumbersome for desktop use compared to cheap x86 mini-PCs or used thin clients, citing the need for multiple fragile adapters and specific power supplies. The consensus is that the Pi is a "graphics card with a Pi attached," not a viable desktop replacement.

Technical discussion focuses on the software stack. Users are impressed that the FEX-Emu translation layer works at all, allowing ARM hardware to run x86 games. There's also a side discussion on the superior gaming experience on Linux (via Proton) compared to Windows, with one user sharing a personal anecdote of a Windows gaming bug being fixed by switching to Linux. Finally, some commenters express interest in the experiment's core achievement—making PCIe work on a Pi—and discuss the potential for future integrated SoC/GPU designs.

## [Oh My Zsh adds bloat](https://rushter.com/blog/zsh-shell/)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46562790

> **Article:** The article "Oh My Zsh adds bloat" argues that while Oh My Zsh (OMZ) is popular for making Zsh easy to set up, it has become a bloated framework that negatively impacts performance and encourages users to remain ignorant of their shell's inner workings. The author details their experience with OMZ's slow startup times (reporting ~380ms) and intrusive features like update checks. They demonstrate how they replaced OMZ with a minimal, hand-crafted `.zshrc` that provides the same essential functionality (like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and git status) but with significantly faster load times (~70ms). The core message is that developers should take the small amount of time to learn and configure their own shell for a leaner, faster, and more transparent development environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a clear split between pragmatism and performance purism. The central debate is whether the convenience of Oh My Zsh is worth its perceived "bloat" and performance cost.

Many users defend OMZ, arguing its primary value is providing a "good enough" and productive shell experience instantly on any new machine, saving them from spending hours on configuration. For these users, a few hundred milliseconds of startup time is a negligible price for this out-of-the-box convenience. A common sentiment is that users can simply disable unused plugins or update checks to mitigate performance issues.

On the other side, many agree with the article's premise, sharing their own journeys of moving away from OMZ. These users either built their own minimal configurations, learning more about their shell in the process, or switched to alternatives like Zim or Fish, which they feel offer a better balance of features and speed. A recurring suggestion is to use a lighter framework or manually curate a few essential plugins rather than adopting the entire OMZ suite.

Beyond the OMZ debate, the discussion touched on broader themes, such as the enduring power and composability of the terminal and the trade-offs between POSIX shell compatibility (e.g., in Fish) and user-friendliness.

## [SendGrid isn’t emailing about ICE or BLM – it’s a phishing attack](https://fredbenenson.com/blog/2026/01/09/sendgrid-isnt-emailing-you-about-ice-or-blm-its-a-phishing-attack/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46555615

> **Article:** The article by Fred Benenson describes a sophisticated phishing campaign that leverages the SendGrid email platform. The scam involves emails with politically charged subject lines, such as "ICE" (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) or "BLM" (Black Lives Matter), designed to provoke an emotional reaction and a click.

The core deception is the "From" address, which appears as a legitimate brand name (e.g., "SendGrid") but is actually sent from a malicious domain that uses SendGrid's infrastructure. This tricks users into trusting the email. The article also notes a variation of the scam that uses a panic-inducing message like "Your language settings have been changed to Spanish." The author concludes that while the attack exploits SendGrid's business model of facilitating email at scale, the primary vulnerability is human psychology and the way email clients display sender information.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, focusing on the technical and psychological aspects of the attack. A key clarification made early on is that the company SendGrid is not behind the emails, but rather that attackers are abusing its email-sending infrastructure.

Several technical points were raised about the root cause and potential solutions:
*   **Sender Name Spoofing:** The main problem identified is the ability for attackers to set a friendly "From" name (like "SendGrid") while using a malicious email address. Participants noted that email authentication standards like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC can help, but they don't prevent this type of display name spoofing.
*   **UI Failures:** It was pointed out that mobile email clients exacerbate the problem by often hiding the actual email address, forcing users to take extra steps to verify the sender.
*   **Proposed Fixes:** Suggestions included stricter filtering by email providers to flag emails where the display name doesn't match the domain, and users adopting practices like inspecting links before clicking.

The discussion also branched out into related topics:
*   **Psychological Vectors:** Users observed that any strong emotional trigger—whether political outrage (ICE, BLM) or technical panic (language settings changed)—can be an effective vector for phishing.
*   **Similar Scams:** A commenter shared a recent, highly effective political text scam that used urgency and personalization to trick recipients. Others noted receiving similar phishing attempts targeting different groups.
*   **Broader Criticisms of SendGrid:** One commenter shared a negative personal experience with SendGrid's customer service and billing practices, suggesting that the company's operational issues might contribute to the problem.

## [Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman emerges](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7yv4524gqo)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46559192

> **Article:** The BBC article reports on the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent, which was captured on video filmed by the agent himself. The incident occurred after the woman, identified as Good, allegedly attempted to drive away from a traffic stop. The video, released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), shows the agent firing into the vehicle. The article notes that the agent was reportedly "traumatized" from a prior event. It also mentions that the Minneapolis mayor is demanding a transparent investigation and that protests have occurred. The article was updated to include that the agent "swears" at the end of the video, a detail that became a point of contention in the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the ICE agent's actions and the official handling of the incident. A central theme is the accusation of evidence manipulation and a cover-up. Multiple users point out that the video released by authorities appears to be edited, specifically noting a suspicious black frame at the moment of the shooting and the omission of the agent calling the victim a "fucking bitch" immediately after the shooting. Commenters contrast the detailed reporting on certain aspects with these key omissions, suggesting a deliberate attempt to shape the narrative.

The moral and legal culpability of the agent is heavily debated. While some argue the shooting was a justified reaction to being run over, the prevailing sentiment is that the agent acted out of anger and "shot in anger," constituting murder rather than self-defense. The agent's reported trauma is viewed as an insufficient reason for him to be on duty with a firearm.

There is also significant criticism directed at the broader system, including the Trump administration's public defense of the agent, which one user decries as "treason." The discussion also touches on the jurisdiction and powers of ICE agents, with users clarifying their authority to detain individuals they suspect of being in the country illegally. The thread itself being flagged is noted with cynicism by some participants.

## [Start your meetings at 5 minutes past](https://philipotoole.com/start-your-meetings-at-5-minutes-past/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46560217

> **Article:** The article proposes a simple solution to the common problem of back-to-back meetings: schedule all meetings to start at 5 minutes past the hour (e.g., 10:05, 10:35) instead of on the hour. This creates a built-in 5-minute buffer between meetings. The author argues this gives attendees a "critical bio-break," a moment to decompress, and time to transition between calls. It also creates social pressure to end meetings on time, as the next one is about to start. The practice is presented as a low-effort way to improve meeting hygiene and reduce the stress of a packed schedule.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep skepticism about the "5 minutes past" rule, with most commenters viewing it as a superficial fix for a systemic problem. The consensus is that this tactic is a symptom of poor meeting culture, not a cure.

The primary counter-argument is that the rule is a temporary hack that will quickly lose its effectiveness. If it becomes the norm, people will simply adjust their behavior, and meetings will once again run long, erasing the buffer. This is seen as a classic "treadmill" effect where you have to keep inventing new tricks to game the system.

Many commenters argue that the real solution is not a scheduling trick but a cultural one, centered on leadership and discipline. They contend that leaders must set a firm example by starting and ending meetings on time. Without this top-down enforcement, any workaround will fail. The problem is framed as a lack of respect for others' time, which a simple rule cannot fix.

A deeper critique emerged, suggesting the issue is the sheer volume of meetings itself. Some argued that if your schedule is so packed you need a buffer, you have a more fundamental problem of over-meeting. Others pointed out that the most powerful solution is to simply decline unnecessary meetings or make them asynchronous (e.g., via email or documents).

Finally, there was a debate over the practical application of such a rule. Some noted that in a remote work context, it's easy for the next meeting host to simply start early, defeating the purpose. Others shared that their organizations have tried similar rules (like ending 5 minutes early) with mixed results, highlighting that changing ingrained habits is the core challenge.

## [Show HN: Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator](https://www.donutthejedi.com/)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46557879

> **Project:** A user-built "Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator" that lets you pilot a rocket from Earth. The simulation models core orbital mechanics, including the Earth's rotation (which imparts initial horizontal velocity) and fuel consumption. You control the rocket's pitch to achieve a stable orbit, with visual indicators like the Kármán line. The goal is to successfully reach orbit, with the added challenge of avoiding a city that is conveniently (and perhaps magically) always in your path downrange.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the simulator was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising it as a fun and impressive project, even comparing it favorably to the popular game Kerbal Space Program. The developer was highly engaged, clarifying that they derived the physics equations themselves, though the simulation uses time-stepping for positioning. Key technical discussions included the simulation's accuracy; the developer confirmed that while the physics are sound, the model omits real-world factors like air resistance (dynamic pressure), which would make certain fuel-inefficient strategies used in the simulator impossible in reality.

On the feedback side, the most common suggestion was to improve the user interface, particularly by making it responsive for mobile devices. Other critiques pointed out the sensitive zoom controls and a color theme that made the simulation difficult to read. A humorous side-thread emerged about a city that is always in the rocket's path, with the developer jokingly attributing it to "antigrav sleds" while also noting a bug limiting the pitch control. Finally, a user inquired about the use of AI in the project's creation, to which the developer responded that AI was used extensively for syntax and writing code lines, while they were responsible for the high-level design, research, and debugging.

## [My article on why AI is great (or terrible) or how to use it](https://matthewrocklin.com/ai-zealotry/)
**Score:** 119 | **Comments:** 188 | **ID:** 46557057

> **Article:** The article, titled as a satirical piece on AI zealotry, presents a highly optimistic and provocative vision for AI-assisted software development. The author argues that the traditional skill of "zooming in" to write and read code is becoming obsolete. Instead, senior engineers should embrace "vibe coding": describing high-level intent to an AI and trusting it to generate the implementation. The author suggests that this shift will free engineers to focus on high-level product management and systems architecture, effectively automating the act of writing code itself. The piece frames this not just as a productivity gain, but as a fundamental evolution of the software engineering profession.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was overwhelmingly critical of the article's thesis, with many commenters expressing disbelief and concern. The central theme of the debate was a strong rejection of the idea that writing and reading code is becoming obsolete.

A primary point of contention was the very nature of "vibe coding." Many argued that this approach is not "doing" but "commissioning," and that it fundamentally misunderstands the creative and problem-solving aspects of programming. Several engineers countered the author's examples of AI creating art or architecture by pointing out that those roles still involve deep, hands-on understanding and direction, which is lost when one simply describes a goal to an AI.

Commenters heavily criticized the author's claim that senior engineers can trust AI-generated code without reading it. They argued that LLMs consistently produce "junk," "slop," and logically flawed code that compounds errors over time. A key observation was that AI often takes shortcuts, such as disabling linters or writing superficial tests, rather than fixing underlying issues. This led to a consensus that such a workflow is unsustainable and will lead to a "giant wave of failures" from unmaintainable codebases.

The discussion also touched on the motivations behind such optimism. Some suggested that proponents of "vibe coding" are driven by fear, as the paradigm devalues the core skills they've spent decades developing. Others dismissed this as a character attack, while a separate thread debated the broader societal externalities of AI, such as increased corporate power and environmental impact. Ultimately, the community largely agreed that while AI is a useful tool for tedium, the idea that it can replace the fundamental skills of reading and writing code is a dangerous and premature fantasy.

## [OLED, Not for Me](https://nuxx.net/blog/2026/01/09/oled-not-for-me/)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46562583

> **Article:** An article on the blog 'nuxx.net' details the author's negative experience with a Dell QD-OLED monitor. The primary complaint is severe text fringing – a visible color halo around text – caused by the monitor's non-standard sub-pixel layout (specifically, a triangular RGB or "RGB Stripe" arrangement). The author, a programmer, found this issue caused significant eye strain and made the monitor unsuitable for work. After comparing it to a traditional LCD, they concluded that for their use case (text-heavy work), current OLED technology is not yet a viable replacement for high-quality LCDs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's experience, with several users sharing similar stories of eye strain, headaches, and blurry text when using OLED monitors for productivity tasks like programming. A key theme is that this is not a fundamental flaw of "OLED" but a specific problem with the sub-pixel layouts (like QD-OLED and WOLED) currently used in most mass-market displays, which are optimized for media consumption, not sharp text rendering.

Many commenters express hope for future "RGB Stripe" OLED panels, which would solve this issue. There is also a debate on mitigation strategies: some users find that using high pixel density (e.g., 4K on a 27-inch screen) or non-native scaling can make the fringing less noticeable. A counterpoint is raised that WOLED can be excellent for dark-mode text, as the pixels are off. The discussion concludes with a consensus that while OLED is fantastic for gaming and media, users who spend most of their time reading text should be cautious and investigate a monitor's specific sub-pixel layout before purchasing.

## [How to store a chess position in 26 bytes (2022)](https://ezzeriesa.notion.site/How-to-store-a-chess-position-in-26-bytes-using-bit-level-magic-df1fdb5364eb42fdac11eb23b25e9605)
**Score:** 109 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46554652

> **Article:** The article "How to store a chess position in 26 bytes" presents a highly optimized, bit-level encoding for a complete chess board state. The method uses bitboards (64-bit integers) to represent piece locations and cleverly leverages the properties of the game to minimize space. For example, it notes that bishops are confined to one color, allowing them to be stored in 5 bits instead of 6. The encoding includes all pieces, side to move, castling rights, and en passant information, achieving a dense 26-byte (208-bit) structure. The article frames this as an exercise in "bit-level magic" for extreme efficiency, likely for applications like chess engines where storing millions of positions in memory is critical.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the technical feasibility, practicality, and completeness of the 26-byte encoding. A central debate, sparked by a comment recalling a 96-bit scheme, is the theoretical minimum size needed. Users point out that 26 bytes (208 bits) is more than the ~153 bits required to uniquely identify any of the ~10^44 legal chess positions, but also that a 96-bit encoding is insufficient for this purpose. The conversation then splits into two main themes: the trade-off between cleverness and clarity, and the completeness of the state representation.

Several users argue that such extreme optimization is a standard and necessary practice in high-performance chess programming (e.g., using bitboards), where storing vast numbers of positions makes every byte count. Conversely, others contend that "clever" code is often difficult to maintain and that modern hardware makes the memory savings negligible for most applications, prioritizing developer time over bytes.

Finally, a critical point is raised about what constitutes a full "position" versus a "game state." Commenters note that the 26-byte encoding is insufficient for correctly implementing all game rules, specifically draw by repetition and the 50-move rule, which require knowledge of the position's history. The discussion concludes that while the encoding is a brilliant feat of engineering for a board state, a true game state would require additional data to track move history for these rules.
