## [The Vietnam government has banned rooted phones from using any banking app](https://xdaforums.com/t/discussion-the-root-and-mod-hiding-fingerprint-spoofing-keybox-stealing-cat-and-mouse-game.4425939/page-118)
**Score:** 470 | **Comments:** 553 | **ID:** 46555963

> **Article:** The article (a discussion thread on XDA Developers) reports that the Vietnamese government has mandated that all banking apps must detect and block access from rooted phones, phones with unlocked bootloaders, or with ADB enabled. The move is framed as a security measure, but the discussion explores the technical feasibility of bypassing the ban, the practical inconvenience for users, and the broader political context of digital control in Vietnam.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the motivations behind the ban, the practical consequences for users, and the technical cat-and-mouse game it creates.

Many users questioned the government's rationale, suggesting that tech enthusiasts who root their phones are generally aware of the risks. However, others proposed that the government's motivation is likely twofold: to shift liability away from banks in case of fraud and to align with broader national security initiatives. Specifically, commenters pointed to Vietnam's "VNeID" project, which aims to link digital identities with mobile devices, suggesting the root ban is a step toward total digital surveillance and control.

The practicality of the ban was heavily debated. While some suggested carrying a separate, non-rooted phone for banking, others noted the financial and logistical burden of maintaining two devices and SIM cards. A key counterpoint was raised that rooting often allows users to keep older hardware running with updated ROMs, preventing e-waste, and that banks' web portals remain accessible from rooted desktop computers, highlighting the inconsistency of targeting only mobile devices.

Technically, the community consensus is that while the ban is a hurdle, it is not insurmountable. Users noted that root-hiding tools can currently bypass these checks, but acknowledged that future security measures (like Google's Play Integrity with remotely provisioned keys) may eventually make it impossible to hide root without exploiting hardware vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the conversation painted the move as part of a wider industry trend where smartphones are becoming locked-down "terminals" rather than personal computers, with users debating whether it is better to circumvent the law or abandon the platform entirely.

## [Cloudflare CEO on the Italy fines](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/2009654937303896492)
**Score:** 461 | **Comments:** 655 | **ID:** 46555760

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter post by Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince regarding fines imposed on the company by Italy's communications regulator, AGCOM. In the post, Prince argues that AGCOM is attempting to impose Italian censorship standards on the global internet. He frames the issue as a threat to free speech and a fundamental unfair trade practice, specifically highlighting the impact on the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics. Prince explicitly thanks US Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk for their leadership on the issue of free speech, asking for their help in resolving the matter.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical and cynical regarding the Cloudflare CEO's statement, with most commenters finding his arguments and alliances deeply ironic. The consensus is that Cloudflare, a powerful internet gatekeeper, is not a credible champion of an "open internet" and is merely protecting its business interests.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Irony and Hypocrisy:** The most frequent point is the irony of Cloudflare, a company that has been criticized for providing services to controversial groups and for its immense market power, positioning itself as a defender of internet freedom. Commenters suggest Prince is upset that a government is "ruining their monopoly" on controlling access.

*   **Criticism of Political Alliances:** Prince's praise for Elon Musk and JD Vance is met with widespread scorn. Users argue that Musk is a "contrarian" who selectively champions free speech while banning critics and that Vance and the current US administration are also threats to free expression. This is seen as a cynical political move to curry favor with the US government rather than a principled stand.

*   **Skepticism of the "Free Speech" Framing:** Many commenters doubt that the Italian fines are a genuine free speech issue. Some provide context that AGCOM is known for petty fines, while others point to similar anti-piracy measures in Europe (like Spain's La Liga) to suggest this is more about copyright enforcement and the specific business context than broad censorship.

*   **Cynicism on Corporate Motives:** Several users interpret the CEO's post as a calculated PR and political strategy. They argue that in the current political climate, tech leaders must publicly align with the ruling administration to protect their business, regardless of their true personal beliefs. This is seen as "playing the game" rather than a genuine moral stance.

*   **Minority Support:** A few users express support for the CEO's "forthrightness" or agree with the underlying point that European regulation can overreach and impact global internet access, but this is a distinct minority view.

## [European Commission issues call for evidence on open source](https://lwn.net/Articles/1053107/)
**Score:** 419 | **Comments:** 326 | **ID:** 46550912

> **Article:** The article, published on LWN.net, reports that the European Commission has issued a "call for evidence" on open source software. This is a formal step in the EU's policy-making process, intended to gather feedback and data on the impact of open source. The goal is to inform a future "Open Source Act" or policy framework, aiming to better leverage open source for technological sovereignty, innovation, and economic competitiveness within the EU. The article likely details the scope of the consultation and the key questions being asked.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with users expressing a mix of optimism, skepticism, and ideological debate.

A central theme is the analogy of open source to political and economic systems. One commenter provocatively equated open source with communism, which sparked a debate. A rebuttal argued that open source is actually a form of decentralization and libertarianism, while proprietary software represents centralization. Others clarified that open source is fundamentally about freedom and collaboration, not state control, and would not function in a top-down communist system.

There is significant debate about the EU's potential role. Skeptics fear that government involvement will lead to bureaucracy, the creation of inefficient "EU-approved" forks of existing projects, and a focus on blame-avoidance rather than genuine innovation. They worry that politicians will prefer the clear contracts of proprietary software over the shared responsibility of open source. However, others counter that the EU already has a strong open source presence, with many foundational projects (like Debian) originating in Europe, and that the EU has a history of funding existing projects like VLC and LibreOffice.

The discussion also touches on the broader goals for the European software industry. One perspective is that the EU doesn't need more open source specifically, but a healthy, competitive domestic software industry to reduce dependency on US tech giants. In this view, open source is just one potential tool, not the ultimate goal. A counter-argument is that for a continent of diverse nations, open source is a logical solution to foster unity and prevent a new software monopoly, and that it provides essential control and trust for government services. The importance of funding and supporting European-based code forges (like Codeberg) was also highlighted as a practical step towards digital sovereignty.

## [Flock Hardcoded the Password for America's Surveillance Infrastructure 53 Times](https://nexanet.ai/blog/53-times-flocksafety-hardcoded-the-password-for-americas-surveillance-infrastructure)
**Score:** 378 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46555807

> **Article:** The article from Nexanet.ai alleges a critical security failure by Flock Safety, a major provider of automated license plate reader (ALPR) cameras to US law enforcement. The core claim is that Flock hardcoded a sensitive API key directly into the firmware of its cameras. This key allegedly provided access to a central AWS S3 bucket containing the video and data feeds from all of Flock's cameras nationwide. The author states they discovered this key exposed in a publicly accessible video feed from a single camera.

The article outlines a responsible disclosure timeline, beginning on November 13, 2025. Flock acknowledged receipt a week later but, as of the article's publication date (January 7, 2026), the vulnerability allegedly remained unpatched for over 55 days. The author withholds specific technical details to prevent exploitation but uses the incident to argue that Flock has a "systemic pattern of credential mismanagement" and is not securing the sensitive surveillance infrastructure it has deployed across the country.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Flock Safety, with commenters expressing a mix of outrage, cynicism, and dark humor. The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative towards the company.

A central theme is the debate over whether this constitutes a "hack." Many users argue that hardcoding a password is not a hack but rather gross negligence, with one user sarcastically noting, "But is it really hacking if they just give you the key?" This ties into a recurring criticism of Flock's public relations, with users pointing out that the company's frequent claim of "never being hacked" is a misleading semantic argument designed to downplay its own security failures.

There is significant discussion about the broader societal implications. Commenters connect Flock's incompetence to the trend of MBAs running tech companies and building dystopian surveillance tools, suggesting they are driven by profit and a desire for control rather than security or public good. The conversation also touches on the difficulty of holding such companies accountable, with some users expressing frustration with local governments for deploying these technologies without proper technical vetting, citing the ShotSpotter controversy as a similar example.

Finally, the discussion includes practical advice and context. Users share links to previous HN discussions about Flock, news of cities choosing not to renew contracts with the company, and a defense of a newly hired CISO at Flock, though this is tempered by criticism that such security leadership should have been in place much earlier for a company handling such sensitive data.

## [Mathematics for Computer Science (2018) [pdf]](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring18/mcs.pdf)
**Score:** 372 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46550895

> **Article:** The article links to the full 2018 PDF of "Mathematics for Computer Science," a textbook from MIT's CS department. The course covers discrete mathematics, logic, proofs, induction, probability, and other foundational mathematical concepts relevant to computer science. The text is known for its rigorous approach and is authored by Eric Lehman, Tom Leighton, and Albert Meyer.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response is overwhelmingly positive, with many users describing the textbook as a "must-have" resource for filling gaps in computer science knowledge, particularly for those without formal degrees. Several users pointed to accompanying resources, such as Tom Leighton's lectures on YouTube and more recent versions of the course on MIT OpenCourseWare.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **Difficulty and Depth:** Users acknowledge the book is "hard af" but rewarding. One commenter humorously noted reading "1-2 pages of each paragraph," highlighting the dense material, while another praised the "four step method" for explaining probability concepts like the Monty Hall paradox.
*   **Learning Resources:** A sub-thread emerged regarding the lack of official solution manuals. Users noted that while universities often withhold answers to reuse questions, modern LLMs (Large Language Models) can now serve as effective tools for verifying work.
*   **Comparison to Other Texts:** A comparison was drawn to "Concrete Mathematics" by Knuth, Graham, and Patashnik. The consensus was that while both are excellent, the MIT text focuses on foundational discrete math, whereas "Concrete Mathematics" is more advanced, focusing on summation and number sequences.
*   **Practical Barriers:** A brief discussion touched on the difficulty of reading the PDF's LaTeX formulas via screen readers, with users expressing skepticism that current technology can handle the mathematical notation effectively.

## [Kagi releases alpha version of Orion for Linux](https://help.kagi.com/orion/misc/linux-status.html)
**Score:** 368 | **Comments:** 255 | **ID:** 46553343

> **Article:** Kagi has released an alpha version of its Orion web browser for Linux. Orion is a browser built on the WebKit engine, which is distinct from the more common Chromium (Blink) and Firefox (Gecko) engines. The alpha is currently not available to the general public and is restricted to "Orion+ supporters," who can access the download via their Kagi billing dashboard.
>
> **Discussion:** The announcement was met with a mix of interest, skepticism, and user feedback about the broader Kagi/Orion ecosystem.

A primary point of discussion was the choice of WebKit. Users speculated that this was likely due to WebKit being the only browser engine allowed on iOS, which would simplify cross-platform development. Others suggested that WebKit might be easier to work with than Firefox's engine for creating a custom browser.

Several comments highlighted the closed-source nature of the browser, which some felt was at odds with the ethos of the Linux community. However, many users were simply happy to see a non-Chromium-based browser being developed.

The discussion also broadened to include user frustrations with the Kagi/Orion product strategy. One user expressed significant frustration with the inability to set Kagi as the default search engine in Safari on iOS, a limitation imposed by Apple. Another user expressed a wish for Kagi to develop a mobile browser for Android, but it was clarified that Kagi is a small team and their development resources are limited, with Orion having taken six years to reach version 1.0 on macOS.

Finally, a practical point was raised about the alpha's availability: some users couldn't find a download link because it is a private alpha, not a public release.

## [“Erdos problem #728 was solved more or less autonomously by AI”](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103)
**Score:** 349 | **Comments:** 209 | **ID:** 46560445

> **Article:** The article links to a Mathstodon post by renowned mathematician Terence Tao, announcing that Erdős problem #728 has been "solved more or less autonomously by AI." The post highlights a milestone in the application of AI to formal mathematics. The solution was achieved using a tool called Aristotle, which is a specialized AI designed to work with the Lean theorem prover. The core of the process involved the AI generating and refining a formal proof, demonstrating a significant step beyond simple language generation and into the realm of formal logical reasoning and problem-solving within a structured mathematical environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely enthusiastic and forward-looking, treating the event as a significant milestone in the capabilities of AI for formal reasoning. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

There is a strong consensus that this development signals a new era for mathematical research. Commenters express excitement about the potential for AI to act as a "co-pilot" for mathematicians, capable of handling tedious proof verification, reconfiguring existing arguments, and exploring novel hypotheses that would be too time-consuming for humans. This is framed as "scientific refactoring"—the ability to rapidly test variations on established theories.

A crucial point of clarification, raised by multiple users, is that this was not achieved by a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, but by a specialized system (Aristotle) trained on formal mathematical logic (Lean). This distinction is used to argue that the future of AI in specialized fields lies in bespoke, domain-specific tools rather than one-size-fits-all models.

The discussion also touches on the practical utility of such tools. A programmer asks if experts in other complex fields get value from AI, and a former pure mathematician confirms that AI tools are becoming essential for literature reviews and routine calculations, though their utility decreases as the research becomes more novel and abstract.

Finally, there is a recurring debate about the nature of AI creativity. While some see this as proof that AI can perform novel reasoning, a skeptical counter-argument suggests the AI is merely performing a highly sophisticated "remix" of patterns present in its training data. However, the consensus, especially given the endorsement from a figure like Terence Tao, is that the goalposts for what AI can achieve in reasoning are moving rapidly.

## [What happened to WebAssembly](https://emnudge.dev/blog/what-happened-to-webassembly/)
**Score:** 332 | **Comments:** 306 | **ID:** 46551044

> **Article:** The article "What happened to WebAssembly" addresses the perception that WASM has failed to live up to its initial hype. It argues that the technology hasn't "failed," but rather that the community's expectations were misaligned with its actual goals and current capabilities. The author explains that WASM was not designed to replace JavaScript for building entire websites, but to serve as a high-performance compilation target for computationally intensive tasks (like Figma's image processing or games). The article also points out significant remaining hurdles, such as the lack of a standardized garbage collector (making it hard for languages like Java or C# to run efficiently), the difficulty of directly manipulating the DOM without JavaScript, and the large binary sizes that impact download times. Ultimately, it concludes that WASM is a powerful but specialized tool that is steadily improving, rather than the revolutionary JS-killer it was once imagined to be.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the gap between WebAssembly's immense potential and its practical, current-day reality. A central theme is the disappointment felt by those who envisioned WASM as a universal "holy grail" capable of replacing not just JavaScript but entire operating systems and container environments. This grand vision clashes with the reality of its primary use case: accelerating specific, performance-critical parts of existing web applications.

Several practical barriers were identified as reasons for WASM's slow adoption for general web development. A major point of contention is the developer experience; many argue that the modern JavaScript ecosystem (React, TypeScript, Vite) is so productive and "good enough" for most tasks that the complexity of a WASM toolchain isn't justified. Furthermore, significant technical hurdles remain, including large binary sizes that slow down initial load times, the lack of seamless multithreading, and the persistent difficulty of directly interacting with the browser's DOM without a costly JavaScript bridge.

The discussion also touched on the ecosystem's internal politics, with one user highlighting the "bad blood" and infighting between different standards groups (like WASI and AssemblyScript) as a source of concern. However, there were strong counterarguments. Some developers shared their positive experiences using WASM for heavy-duty applications like image editors, validating its performance benefits where they matter most. Others pointed out that WASM is already a quiet success, powering many of the build tools and even some components within the JavaScript ecosystem itself. The debate ultimately reflects a split between those who see WASM as a revolutionary platform for the future and those who view it as a powerful, specialized tool that is already finding its niche.

## [London–Calcutta bus service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%E2%80%93Calcutta_bus_service)
**Score:** 330 | **Comments:** 165 | **ID:** 46554462

> **Article:** The Wikipedia article details the historic London–Calcutta bus service, which operated from 1957 to 1976. Run by a company named "Tropic Air," the service was a 50-day, 8,000-mile overland journey from London to Calcutta (now Kolkata). The route passed through Europe, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and finally India. It was marketed as a cheaper and more adventurous alternative to air travel, with a one-way ticket costing around £85 in 1957 (equivalent to roughly £1,800-£2,600 in 2023, depending on the inflation measure used). The service ceased operations due to political instability, specifically the 1970s oil crisis and the outbreak of war in Afghanistan.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is a mix of nostalgia, historical context, and modern comparisons. A central theme is the feasibility and appeal of such a journey today versus in the past. Many commenters express disbelief at the time commitment, noting that few people could afford to take 50 days off work. However, others provide historical context, with one user sharing a story of a friend who took the route in the 1970s to live cheaply in India on UK unemployment benefits.

There is a significant debate about the "good old days." One commenter suggests that travel was simpler before WW1 (no passports needed in Europe), which prompts a counter-argument from others listing modern advancements like medicine, sanitation, and civil rights. The cost of the historic journey is also analyzed; while the inflation-adjusted price seems high, some argue that for a 50-day all-inclusive trip, it was relatively reasonable, especially compared to the prohibitive cost of flying in that era.

Finally, the conversation branches into related topics. Users share links to photos and similar historical discussions. There are also comparisons to modern travel options, such as budget bus services in Europe, and the logistical challenges of crossing certain borders today. The thread concludes with mentions of similar long-distance bus services, like the American "Green Tortoise," which some users have personally experienced.

## [Exercise can be nearly as effective as therapy for depression](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260107225516.htm)
**Score:** 328 | **Comments:** 261 | **ID:** 46557233

> **Article:** The article links to a ScienceDaily piece summarizing a Cochrane systematic review. The review analyzed 57 trials involving nearly 2,200 participants to compare the effects of exercise against no treatment or control interventions for depression. The findings indicate that exercise may reduce depressive symptoms, with a pooled standardized mean difference of -0.67. The article frames this as evidence that exercise can be "nearly as effective as therapy," though the underlying study notes that the evidence quality is low to very low, particularly regarding long-term effects.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide between personal experience, clinical reality, and statistical interpretation of the study's findings.

A central theme is the "chicken-and-egg" problem: while exercise is beneficial, depression often saps the motivation required to start. Several users countered this by suggesting small, manageable steps—like short walks—can build momentum without requiring deep discipline. Others noted that the repetitive nature of activities like walking can be meditative, allowing for mental processing.

The conversation diverged into a significant debate about the efficacy of standard depression treatments. Some commenters expressed skepticism, arguing that both therapy and medication have limited effectiveness for many. However, this was challenged by others who shared positive experiences with antidepressants and therapy, emphasizing that while not a panacea, they are vital tools. One user detailed a multi-pronged approach using medication, therapy, and exercise simultaneously.

A highly technical thread emerged, questioning the study's statistical claims. A user pointed out that the reported effect size (SMD of -0.67) is a statistical metric with no inherent clinical meaning. They argued that for a treatment to be considered meaningful, it must cross a "Minimal Clinically Important Difference" (MCID) threshold. They suggested that if exercise is only "nearly as effective" as therapy, and therapy itself often barely meets the MCID, then the practical benefit of exercise might be negligible for many patients.

Finally, the discussion included personal anecdotes that ran counter to the article's premise. One user reported that despite significant weight loss and a rigorous walking routine, their deep depression remained unchanged, highlighting that the relationship between physical health and mental well-being is not always straightforward.

## [JavaScript Demos in 140 Characters](https://beta.dwitter.net)
**Score:** 223 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46557489

> **Article:** The article links to Dwitter, a social network and coding challenge platform where users create and share real-time graphical demos (like animations, visual effects, and games) written in JavaScript, with a strict character limit of 140 characters. The site provides a canvas and a `u` object, and the code must fit within a `update(u)` function. It is a code-golfing style community focused on creativity and technical ingenuity within tight constraints.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the creative coding techniques used to meet the 140-character limit and the "metagame" of optimizing for the platform's specific rules.

A major theme is the debate around "cheating" versus clever compression. Users noted that many demos use `eval(unescape(...))` or similar tricks to pack much larger amounts of code into the character limit. While some see this as a loophole, others argue it's a valid and creative part of the challenge. A related point was made about the difference between character count and byte count; since multi-byte Unicode characters count as a single character, they can be used to store more data. It was noted that the site's beta version addresses this with a "compressed" toggle that measures bytes instead.

Other points of discussion included:
*   **Technical Ingenuity:** Users shared advanced techniques for code compression, such as embedding compressed binary data (like a PNG) into a file and using browser APIs to decompress it at runtime.
*   **JavaScript Features:** The use of tagged template literals (e.g., `` console.log`weeee` ``) was highlighted as a valid, lesser-known JS feature that can be useful for such challenges.
*   **Platform Feedback:** Some users reported the site was unresponsive, while others discussed potential improvements, such as adding more built-in shortcuts or disallowing `eval`. A developer of the site chimed in to explain the history and the philosophy of keeping the rules fixed to encourage creativity.

## [How Markdown took over the world](https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/09/how-markdown-took-over-the-world/)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46556695

> **Article:** The article "How Markdown took over the world" by Anil Dash argues that Markdown's success was not inevitable but a result of its arrival at a specific cultural moment. It emerged in the mid-2000s as a rejection of the complexity and vendor lock-in of enterprise tools like DocBook and Microsoft Word. Markdown's core appeal lies in its "worse is better" philosophy: it is simple, human-readable in its raw form, and prioritizes content over formatting. The author frames Markdown as a key enabler of the blogging revolution, providing an accessible way for non-technical people to write for the web. It succeeded because it was a pragmatic, minimalist tool that empowered users rather than overwhelming them with features.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely affirms the article's thesis while adding nuance and historical context. A central theme is the "worse is better" concept, where users and developers chose Markdown's simplicity over the technical superiority or feature-richness of alternatives like DocBook, LaTeX, or even HTML. This is seen as a victory for user experience and focus on content.

The conversation also delves into Markdown's imperfections. One commenter points out an ambiguity in the article's own rendering of underscores, which sparked a debate on the semantic difference between `<em>` (emphasis) and `<i>` (italics), highlighting a common point of friction in Markdown's design.

Historically, commenters brought up competing syntaxes like Textile, noting it was a contemporary of Markdown on the Movable Type platform and that its creator, Dean Allen, was highly influential. There was also a minor political-historical tangent about the 2004 US presidential candidates mentioned in the article.

Finally, the discussion looks forward and backward. Some users mention moving on to more modern tools like Typst, which they see as an evolution combining Markdown's ease-of-use with the power of LaTeX. Others speculate on Markdown's future, wondering if its widespread use in LLM outputs could push browsers to render it natively, much like they do with HTML today.

## [Do not mistake a resilient global economy for populist success](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2026/01/08/do-not-mistake-a-resilient-global-economy-for-populist-success)
**Score:** 206 | **Comments:** 265 | **ID:** 46550777

> **Article:** This Economist article argues that the current resilience of the global economy—characterized by low inflation and steady growth—is not a vindication of populist policies like tariffs and protectionism. In fact, the author contends that these policies are actively damaging long-term economic health. The piece asserts that the economic success is largely driven by the private sector's dynamism (specifically citing the AI boom) and warns against crediting political leaders for a prosperity that stems from underlying market strengths that their policies may actually undermine. The core message is a defense of free-market fundamentals against the rising tide of economic nationalism.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a multifaceted critique of the article's thesis, moving beyond simple agreement or disagreement to explore the nuances of economic measurement, the roots of populism, and the roles of public and private sectors.

A central theme is the debate over what constitutes a "healthy" economy. Several commenters argue that standard metrics like GDP and stock market performance are poor indicators of well-being for the average person. They point out that rising living costs and stagnant job prospects can negate the benefits of a 401(k) or GDP growth, suggesting that a disconnect between macroeconomic indicators and individual experience is a primary driver of populist sentiment.

The conversation also delves into the article's attribution of economic success. While the author credits the private sector, many commenters push back, arguing for a "yin and yang" relationship between public and private investment. They cite foundational research in AI, solar energy, and space exploration as examples where government funding and university STEM programs were essential precursors to private-sector booms, suggesting that a simplistic "free markets vs. state planning" framework is misleading.

Finally, the discussion provides a psychological and political analysis of populism itself. One commenter defines it as the public's withdrawal of consent from a "managerialist" elite who have "broken the deal" by failing to deliver growth and effective governance. Another provides a UK-specific example, describing a "managed decline" where mainstream parties offer cautious, incremental changes that fail to address systemic issues like debt and service decay, thus creating a vacuum that populist figures promising radical (even if "bullshit") change can fill. The thread also includes smaller debates on technical financial topics like currency risk in international investing, further highlighting the community's focus on the practical realities behind economic narratives.

**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46557029

> **Project:** The project, "Scroll Wikipedia like TikTok," is a web application that presents Wikipedia articles in a short-form, vertical video format. It uses AI to generate a "story" from a Wikipedia page, which is then displayed with animated text appearing word-by-word, accompanied by audio. The underlying technology involves generating the UI on-the-fly using a generative AI model (likely Gemini) to create the HTML/CSS for each "story," which is then rendered in the browser.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to the project was mixed, with a notable split between appreciating the technical execution and criticizing the concept's utility. Many commenters found the project visually and technically impressive, praising the animations, audio, and the "cool factor" of the generative UI. However, a significant counter-argument emerged around the idea of "enshittifying" knowledge, with critics finding the format annoying and counterproductive for learning, especially for users who cannot listen to audio. The project was also immediately recognized as being similar to previous concepts like "WikTok" and "WikiTok." A sub-thread delved into the technical implementation, confirming the use of AI SDKs to stream generated UI components, and another commenter suggested using specific video generation tools (LTX) to create similar content, which another user labeled as "frictionless slop." The discussion also branched into broader, more abstract critiques of "Just-In-Time app generation" as a paradigm.

**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46558148

> **Article:** The article "Can it game?" by Scott J. G. explores the performance of a Raspberry Pi 5 by attempting to run modern, demanding PC games on it. To overcome the Pi's inherent graphical limitations, the author connects a high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 graphics card via a PCIe adapter. The setup uses the FEX-Emu translation layer to run x86_64 Linux games on the Pi's ARM architecture. The author successfully runs titles like *Cyberpunk 2077*, *Doom: The Dark Ages*, and *God of War Ragnarök*, achieving playable frame rates (e.g., ~60 FPS in *Cyberpunk* at 1080p with DLSS) when the GPU is utilized, though the Pi's CPU remains a significant bottleneck. The article concludes that while technically impressive, the setup is a "monstrous" and impractical "Pi with a graphics card attached," highlighting the architectural mismatch between a low-power SBC and a massive desktop GPU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, touching on nostalgia, hardware practicality, and the surprising capabilities of modern software. A significant portion of the conversation was nostalgic, with users reminiscing about classic gaming benchmarks like "Can it run Crysis?" and recalling the experience of playing games like *Morrowind* on single-digit frame rates with older hardware like Celeron processors.

The practicality and value of the Raspberry Pi were heavily debated. Several commenters argued that Pis have become too expensive and are inferior to x86 mini-PCs or used thin clients for desktop use, citing the need for numerous fragile adapters and high-power accessories. However, others defended the Pi's value, noting that its premium is for its standardized physical form factor and vast ecosystem of niche accessories, which makes it ideal for specific hardware projects.

There was general amazement at the technical achievement itself. Commenters were impressed that the software stack (FEX-Emu for ARM translation, Proton for compatibility) and hardware (eGPU connection) worked well enough to run modern, demanding games at all. This led to a side discussion on the quality of Linux gaming, with one user sharing a personal anecdote about their NVIDIA GPU performing more reliably on Linux (via Bazzite/Proton) than on Windows due to persistent driver crashes. Finally, a technical point was raised about the anti-cheat/DRM in *Doom: The Dark Ages*, clarifying that it was likely Denuvo DRM, not an anti-cheat system.

## [SendGrid isn’t emailing about ICE or BLM – it’s a phishing attack](https://fredbenenson.com/blog/2026/01/09/sendgrid-isnt-emailing-you-about-ice-or-blm-its-a-phishing-attack/)
**Score:** 180 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46555615

> **Article:** The article by Fred Benenson describes a sophisticated phishing campaign that leverages the infrastructure of the legitimate email service provider SendGrid. The scam emails use highly inflammatory political and social topics—such as "supporting ICE" or "BLM"—in the subject line to provoke panic and urgency, tricking recipients into clicking malicious links. The author clarifies that SendGrid the company is not behind these emails, but rather that attackers are exploiting the platform's ability to send emails that appear to come from legitimate domains, bypassing basic spam filters and making the scam more convincing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's claims, with multiple users reporting they have received similar phishing attempts. The conversation centers on the technical and psychological aspects of these attacks. Key points include:

*   **Widespread Experience:** Several commenters confirm receiving these or similar phishing texts and emails, noting the use of other emotionally charged topics like Spanish language settings or LGBTQ+ issues to induce panic.
*   **Technical Vulnerabilities:** A major theme is the failure of email authentication standards (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to prevent brand impersonation in the "From" field's display name. Users lament that mobile email clients often hide the actual sender address, making it even harder to spot fakes.
*   **Social Engineering Tactics:** The discussion highlights the effectiveness of the social engineering, using political polarization and urgency (e.g., threatening to change a voter's registration) to bypass rational thought. One user shared a similar SMS scam that was particularly clever.
*   **Criticism of SendGrid:** While some defend SendGrid as an infrastructure provider, others share negative personal experiences with the company, citing poor customer service and billing issues, suggesting a pattern of operational problems.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** Commenters suggest practical workarounds, such as using unique email addresses for sign-ups (e.g., service@yourdomain.com) and carefully inspecting links before clicking.

## [Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman emerges](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7yv4524gqo)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46559192

> **Article:** The BBC article reports on the release of video footage filmed by an ICE agent who shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis. The video, captured on the agent's iPhone, shows a confrontation where the agent and other law enforcement officers attempted to stop a vehicle. The woman in the vehicle attempted to drive away, and the agent, who was standing near the car, fired his weapon, killing her. The article notes that the agent was reportedly "traumatized" from a prior event but was on duty. The video's release has prompted protests and calls for a transparent investigation from the Minneapolis mayor. The article was updated to include that the agent "swears" in the final part of the video, a detail that critics argue is a euphemism for the agent calling the victim a "fucking bitch" immediately after the shooting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with users debating the legality and morality of the shooting. A central point of contention is whether the agent's actions constituted murder or justified self-defense. Many commenters argue that the agent acted out of anger and "executed" the woman, pointing to his post-shooting comment ("Fucking bitch") as evidence of his state of mind. They contend that his lack of restraint and "trigger-happiness" make him unfit for duty. Conversely, others argue that the shooting was justified because the woman allegedly tried to run the agent over with her car, which they see as a lethal threat that warranted a lethal response.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the media's portrayal of the event. One commenter heavily criticizes the BBC article for editing the video and using euphemistic language ("the agent swears") to downplay the fact that the agent immediately insulted the victim. This user accuses the media of obfuscating the agent's emotional state and the full context of the incident.

There is also a debate over the legal framework and jurisdiction of ICE agents, with users clarifying their authority to detain suspected undocumented immigrants and arrest those who obstruct them. The political context is also touched upon, with one user making a sharp comparison to the Derek Chauvin case and accusing the current administration of treason for defending the agent's actions. The conversation also briefly touches on the possibility of international prosecution for the agent, which is quickly dismissed as unlikely due to US law.

## [MCP is a fad](https://tombedor.dev/mcp-is-a-fad/)
**Score:** 138 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46552254

> **Article:** The article "MCP is a fad" argues that the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an over-engineered and misguided standard for connecting AI agents to external tools and data. The author contends that creating AI-specific files (like `claude.md` or MCP configurations) is a mistake. Instead, they advocate for a "human-first" approach: organizing documentation and commands for human usability (e.g., using standard `justfiles` or CLIs) and then teaching the AI how to leverage those existing, human-centric systems. The author concedes in the comments that their initial criticism of "Claude Skills" was too harsh, but maintains the core thesis that AI-specific abstractions are inferior to optimizing for humans first.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the article's premise, with most commenters viewing MCP as a necessary, if imperfect, step forward. Several key themes emerged:

*   **Defense of MCP's Utility:** Many argued that MCP solves a real and immediate problem by providing a standardized way for diverse AI applications (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor) to interact with external tools. One commenter highlighted the practicality of being able to add a simple "Clock" MCP server to any AI app, something that is otherwise impossible.
*   **Security Concerns:** A significant portion of the discussion focused on the security risks of MCP. Commenters described the standard as "horrific" and "broken" from a security perspective, warning that it's easy to create servers with data exfiltration loopholes and that adding third-party servers consumes valuable context window space.
*   **Critique of the Article's Arguments:** Several users found the article's reasoning weak. One pointed out that the author's dismissal of "Claude Skills" as "over-engineered" was factually incorrect and reduced their credibility. Others felt the article missed the broader need for protocols to handle networked and asynchronous services, not just local tools.
*   **Broader Skepticism:** A tangential but notable thread questioned the long-term value of AI for coding itself, with some users claiming its use is limited to autocomplete and codebase navigation, though this was strongly contested by others who have adopted the technology more fully.

## [Show HN: Rocket Launch and Orbit Simulator](https://www.donutthejedi.com/)
**Score:** 116 | **Comments:** 34 | **ID:** 46557879

> **Project:** This is a web-based "Show HN" project: a rocket launch and orbit simulator. The simulator allows users to launch a rocket from a rotating Earth, manage its pitch and thrust, and attempt to achieve a stable orbit. The developer created the physics engine themselves, deriving the equations and using time-step calculations for positioning. The simulation includes features like a Karman line indicator and events, and the developer notes that it does not currently model atmospheric drag, which allows for maneuvers that would be impossible or dangerous in real life.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the simulator was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising it as "awesome," "fun," and a great technical achievement. Commenters frequently compared it favorably to the popular game Kerbal Space Program (KSP), noting a strong audience for this type of simulation.

Several users engaged with the simulation's physics and accuracy. One user questioned why the rocket moved horizontally immediately upon launch; the developer explained this is due to the simulation modeling the Earth's rotation (408 m/s at Cape Canaveral). Another user noted that the simulator showed the Karman line at an incorrect altitude (98-99km instead of 100km), suggesting a minor tweak was needed. A discussion on accuracy arose when a user noted that a specific maneuver (turning 45 degrees immediately) felt unrealistic. The developer confirmed this, explaining that while possible in the simulation (which lacks air resistance), it would generate fatal dynamic pressure and be highly inefficient in real life.

Feedback on the user interface was mixed but constructive. A common suggestion was to improve mobile responsiveness, which the developer acknowledged. One commenter found the UI and color theme cumbersome and the zoom overly sensitive, suggesting a theming exercise. Conversely, another user found the UI "friendly and approachable."

Finally, the project's development process was also discussed. The developer confirmed they derived the core math themselves but used AI for approximately 90% of the code syntax, while manually handling debugging and feature design.
