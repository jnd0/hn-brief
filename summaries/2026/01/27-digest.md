# HN Daily Digest - 2026-01-27

 Moonshot AI dropped Kimi K2.5 this morning, a 1T parameter MoE model that’s got the HN crowd doing back-of-the-envelope calculations on NVLink bandwidth rather than benchmarking poetry. The headlines scream "open source SOTA" and "agent swarms," but the real story is in the infrastructure reality: you’ll need sixteen H100s linked up to run this thing properly, or roughly half a million dollars worth of hardware sitting in your rack. Sure, you can try to route it through Thunderbolt 5 on a pair of Mac Studios like some hobbyist suggested, but good luck with that expert switching latency when your 32B active parameters start shuffling between experts. The economics here are performative—Moonshot released it under a modified MIT license that requires you to plaster their branding everywhere if you hit 100M MAU or $20M monthly revenue, which is essentially asking for a million dollars worth of billboard space instead of cash. It’s a clever hedge: they know nobody can afford to self-host at scale anyway, so they’re buying mindshare while funneling everyone back to their API at fifty cents per million tokens.

All this arrives exactly one year after DeepSeek cracked the open-source ceiling, and the timing has people wondering if OpenAI’s moat is evaporating faster than their cash burn. A satirical tracker site asking "Is OpenAI Dead Yet?" hit the front page, which tells you everything about the current sentiment. The reality is more nuanced—OpenAI isn’t dead, but they’re trapped in a brutally commoditized market where Claude, Gemini, and now Kimi are trading blows on benchmarks that users stopped caring about three months ago. The Chinese competition angle keeps resurfacing, with some arguing that Western assumptions of permanent AI dominance mirror the old manufacturing arrogance, while others point out that Moonshot’s training run probably cost more than most Series C valuations. Either way, the "magic technology" is now freely downloadable, which makes the early 2023 rhetoric about needing protection from open models look almost quaint.

While AI models get more open, social platforms are getting more cagey. TikTok’s new Oracle-led ownership structure is already generating censorship accusations, with celebrities claiming ICE-critical content is getting throttled and users reporting that DMs containing the word "Epstein" are being blocked entirely. The veracity of the latter claim remains conveniently unverified—classic Twitter fodder—but the former has triggered the usual HN debates about whether we’re watching algorithmic noise or deliberate political suppression. What’s clear is that the platform’s 150% spike in uninstalls following the joint venture isn’t just about privacy policies; it’s about users finally realizing that switching from ByteDance to Larry Ellison’s consortium just trades one surveillance state for another, except this one has precincts down the street. The irony that Americans fear their own government’s data collection more than China’s is lost on nobody, particularly when the new terms demand precise location data instead of approximate.

Speaking of which, the US administration is reportedly preparing to require social media accounts, email histories, mobile app data, and possibly DNA samples from travelers—a data haul that would make Palantir’s engineers weep with joy. Brian Krebs’ reporting on this sparked immediate practical concerns from the privacy-tool crowd: good luck disclosing your "primary email" when you’ve got five hundred Relay aliases, or explaining why your DNA doesn’t match your passport photo after a sequencing error. The consensus is that this isn’t about security at all; it’s a loyalty test designed to create pretexts for denial of entry. Meanwhile, Palantir’s CEO spent the week defending their ICE contracts by claiming their "Fully Autonomous System" would have calculated the "correct score" for a recent police shooting victim, either preventing the death or at least reducing the bullet count. The cynicism is almost refreshing—at least they’re not pretending anymore.

The international surveillance game isn’t limited to US borders. Leaked documents reveal Russia has been weaponizing Interpol’s red notices to target critics abroad, though HN commenters quickly dove into the weeds debating whether one particular target was a genuine dissident or just a corrupt oligarch playing the persecution card. The distinction matters less than the systemic rot: authoritarian regimes have learned to exploit the same international law enforcement mechanisms designed to catch actual criminals, and Western governments keep honoring these requests until someone files the right paperwork to prove they’re politically motivated. It’s a bureaucratic trap that catches dissidents while actual oligarchs buy London mansions.

France is trying the opposite approach, passing legislation to ban social media for under-15s entirely, with platforms facing sanctions if they don’t implement age verification. The legal experts are already predicting this will collapse under EU jurisdiction rules, and the Conseil d'État is skeptical. The debate on HN split between digital natives nostalgic for the text-only forums of the 90s—where you might actually make a friend instead of doomscrolling—and pragmatists noting that banning soda at bars doesn’t fix the bar. The deeper issue is definitional: try legally distinguishing between TikTok’s algorithmic engagement-maximization and Hacker News’s own ranking system without banning both. Good luck.

Amid all this surveillance capitalism and regulatory theater, there’s a quiet rebellion happening in the retro computing threads. Someone compiled a list of working telnet destinations, sending the old guard into reminiscences about towel.blinkenlights.nl and the Star Wars ASCII animation. It’s a reminder of when the internet was a text-based place you could actually understand, before it became a surveillance apparatus wrapped in JavaScript frameworks. Meanwhile, a novice programmer asked for 6502 assembly books for the Apple II and got twenty thoughtful recommendations for Roger Wagner’s "Assembly Lines" and Jim Sather’s hardware bibles—a level of mentorship that still happens here when the topic is sufficiently obsolete. TonyStr’s writeup of building Git from scratch in Rust rounded out the nostalgia tour, proving that understanding your tools down to the zlib compression level is still a viable educational path, even if the repo gets scraped by LLM training bots before you hit publish.

YC quietly removed Canada from its investment list this week, stranding prospective Canadian founders who now need to relocate to participate. No explanation given, though the discussion was minimal—perhaps everyone’s too busy shorting OpenAI exposure through Oracle stock to care. Tesla, meanwhile, is shipping the Cybertruck to the Middle East to escape collapsing US demand and
