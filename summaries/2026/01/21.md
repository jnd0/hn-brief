# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-21

## [EU–INC – A new pan-European legal entity](https://www.eu-inc.org/)
**Score:** 624 | **Comments:** 595 | **ID:** 46703763

> **Article:** The article links to a proposal for "EU-Inc," a new pan-European legal entity championed by EU leadership. The initiative aims to create a single, unified corporate structure to simplify business operations across the European Union. Key goals include allowing entrepreneurs to register a company fully online within 48 hours, establishing a harmonized capital regime without minimum requirements (contrasting with the expensive Societas Europaea), and fostering a more integrated capital market to help startups scale. The proposal is positioned as a way to make the EU more competitive with markets like the US and China, with a target implementation date around 2027.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of optimism and skepticism regarding the EU-Inc proposal. The sentiment is generally positive among founders who have faced administrative hurdles, particularly in countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Several users shared personal anecdotes about the difficulty and cost of setting up and running companies across different EU member states, expressing hope that a unified structure would reduce friction and allow businesses to operate seamlessly across borders.

However, the discussion also highlights significant concerns and nuances. A key point of debate is whether the proposal actually solves a major problem, with some users arguing that company registration is already simple in many European nations (e.g., Sweden, UK, Estonia) and that the real challenge lies in ongoing operations and regulatory compliance. There is also technical and political skepticism: one user questions whether the entity will be established as a Directive (requiring national implementation, similar to GDPR) rather than a Regulation, which could lead to fragmented application. Others pointed out that the proposal is not yet adopted and faces a lengthy legislative process. Finally, the discussion briefly touched on related EU policies, with some users expressing concern over the EU's energy market unification and the status of the Mercosur trade agreement.

## [Anthropic's original take home assignment open sourced](https://github.com/anthropics/original_performance_takehome)
**Score:** 584 | **Comments:** 307 | **ID:** 46700594

> **Article:** Anthropic has open-sourced its original performance-oriented take-home assignment for engineering candidates. The assignment involves optimizing a simulated kernel builder (`KernelBuilder.build_kernel`) to minimize execution cycles on a fake, simulated machine. The goal is to beat the performance of Anthropic's own AI model, Claude Opus 4.5, which achieved a score of 1487 cycles. The repository includes a simulator and profiling tools, such as Chrome tracing, to measure performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the assignment focuses on three main themes: the nature of the challenge, the hiring philosophy it represents, and the tone of Anthropic's communication.

Many commenters analyzed the technical requirements, concluding that the assignment tests deep knowledge of GPU architecture, memory layout (polyhedral algebra), and low-level optimization techniques like SIMD or PTX. Several users found the problem interesting and challenging, with one noting it resembles "demoscene" code golf. However, others criticized the format, arguing that a two-hour time limit favors regurgitating standard optimization tricks rather than fostering genuine creativity.

The discussion also debated the effectiveness of this hiring method. While some appreciated that it focused on hardcore engineering skills rather than typical web app projects, others felt it was a narrow filter that might miss broader engineering talent. There was also confusion regarding the time limit, with some clarifying that the two-hour benchmark referred to the AI's performance, not a strict limit for human candidates.

Finally, commenters reacted strongly to the tone of the assignment's README, which challenged candidates to beat Claude's score to "perhaps discuss interviewing." Many interpreted this as arrogant or "pompous," while others viewed it as a confident (if cocky) standard for a top-tier AI lab. A few users also used the thread to critique Anthropic's corporate ethics and the performance issues of competing AI models like Gemini.

## [California is free of drought for the first time in 25 years](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-09/california-has-no-areas-of-dryness-first-time-in-25-years)
**Score:** 437 | **Comments:** 234 | **ID:** 46698660

> **Article:** A Los Angeles Times article reports that for the first time in 25 years, California is officially free of drought conditions. This follows a period of significant rainfall that has replenished reservoirs and improved soil moisture across the state, ending a long-term dry period that had led to strict water conservation measures.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this news is characterized by skepticism and historical context rather than simple celebration. While some users express personal relief at seeing the state's landscape turn green, the prevailing sentiment is that this respite is likely temporary.

A central theme is the cyclical nature of California's climate. Multiple commenters, citing John Steinbeck's *East of Eden*, emphasize that the state has a long history of alternating wet and dry years, and that forgetting the "dry years" during the "wet years" is a recurring human failing. This historical perspective tempers the optimism of the news.

Technical and infrastructure debates are prominent. One user argues that the drought is a direct failure of the state to build more dams, but this is quickly countered by others who point out the high environmental and financial costs of dams, the scarcity of viable sites for new construction, and the fact that dams cannot solve multi-year droughts. The discussion also delves into the specifics of the current water year, with some noting that while precipitation is high, the low snowpack (due to warm temperatures) could limit water availability during the dry summer months, as snowmelt is crucial for sustained supply.

The conversation broadens to include economic and regional perspectives. Several users point out that water rates remain high despite the end of the drought, explaining that the cost of water infrastructure and delivery is independent of short-term rainfall. There's also a notable shift in focus to other parts of the U.S., with commenters highlighting severe droughts in their own "flyover" states, suggesting that California's good fortune is an exception in a wider national context of dry conditions.

## [cURL removes bug bounties](https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html)
**Score:** 393 | **Comments:** 225 | **ID:** 46701733

> **Article:** The article reports that the cURL project has discontinued its HackerOne bug bounty program. The primary reason cited is the overwhelming volume of low-quality, automated, and AI-generated vulnerability reports, often referred to as "slop." These reports are not from genuine security researchers but from individuals attempting to game the system for potential payouts, creating a significant burden on the project's maintainers to sift through the noise.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters sharing similar experiences and analyzing the broader implications. The core theme is the deluge of low-quality, AI-generated "slop" overwhelming security reporting systems. Several users shared anecdotes from their own companies, describing how their security email inboxes and bug bounty programs are now flooded with useless or entirely fabricated reports from AI-powered "security companies" and opportunistic individuals.

The conversation explored potential solutions to this problem. A frequently suggested idea is implementing an entry fee for submissions, which would be refunded if the report is deemed valid. This would create a financial barrier to spamming. Another suggestion was to use LLMs to filter the incoming reports, though this was met with some skepticism. Commenters also debated whether the financial incentive of bounties is the main driver, with some arguing that the desire to build a reputation as a "security expert" by listing submissions on a resume is an equally powerful motivator, meaning the slop might continue even without bounties.

A deeper theme emerged about the negative impact of AI on open-source communities. One commenter argued that open source is uniquely vulnerable, as its code was used to train the models that are now being used to spam it, while also potentially eroding its business models. The discussion concluded with a philosophical point that this is fundamentally a human problem of bad-faith actors exploiting a system, rather than a tool-specific issue, though the scale of the problem has been dramatically amplified by generative AI.

## [Show HN: ChartGPU – WebGPU-powered charting library (1M points at 60fps)](https://github.com/ChartGPU/ChartGPU)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46706528

> **Project:** ChartGPU is a new open-source charting library that leverages WebGPU to render high-performance data visualizations directly in the browser. The project claims to handle up to 1 million data points at 60fps, targeting use cases like time-series, financial charts, and dashboards. It is currently a passion project with an MIT license, though the creator is considering enterprise tiers for future sustainability.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to ChartGPU was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising its smooth performance and speed. Several commenters benchmarked the library on high-end hardware, reporting frame rates as high as 165fps, which led to a suggestion for a built-in benchmarking tool to easily compare performance across different machines.

Technical compatibility was a major topic. While Chrome users on Linux and Windows reported success (sometimes requiring specific flags like Vulkan), Firefox users faced challenges due to partial WebGPU support and blocklist issues, particularly on macOS and non-Windows platforms. Android users also noted that WebGPU support is still rolling out. A specific UI bug regarding scrollbars on macOS and Windows was identified and acknowledged by the developer.

Feature requests focused on expanding the library's utility. Users asked for OffscreenCanvas support to run the library entirely within worker threads, which the developer indicated is a priority for the roadmap. Other suggestions included better error handling for unsupported browsers and fixes for non-responsive UI elements in the demo.

## [How AI destroys institutions](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-ai-destroys-institutions/)
**Score:** 282 | **Comments:** 224 | **ID:** 46705606

> **Article:** The article, "How AI Destroys Institutions," argues that AI, particularly generative AI, is fundamentally incompatible with the core functions of purpose-driven institutions like higher education, medicine, and law. The author posits that these institutions rely on structured processes, expert authority, and shared standards to reduce chaos and enable reliable knowledge production. AI, by contrast, offers frictionless, personalized, and unaccountable outputs that bypass these established structures. The paper contends that this undermines institutional authority, degrades the quality of information, and erodes the social trust necessary for these institutions to function, ultimately leading to their decay as AI-generated content floods our information ecosystems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and largely critical of the article's premise and academic rigor. A significant portion of the debate centers on the paper's quality, with several commenters dismissing it as an unsubstantiated "opinion piece" despite its Stanford affiliation and extensive footnotes. Specific criticisms point to poorly researched examples, such as the FDA's use of AI, and a lack of nuance in its argument.

Conversely, other users defend the paper's core thesis, arguing that critics are either misinterpreting the argument or reacting to the title without reading the content. A prominent counter-argument is that institutions bear some responsibility for their own decline; they have failed to live up to their ideals, making AI's accessible and low-cost alternatives appealing to a public that has lost trust in traditional authority.

The discussion also branches into broader themes. Some see this as an inevitable consequence of technological revolution, while others argue that institutions like the free press were already "fatally wounded" by previous technologies like social media. There is also a philosophical tangent on the nature of social science versus "hard science," questioning the validity of all scientific claims. Ultimately, the comments reflect a deep skepticism towards the article's specific claims, a defense of its general warning, and a debate over the culpability of existing institutions in their own potential obsolescence.

## [The challenges of soft delete](https://atlas9.dev/blog/soft-delete.html)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46698061

> **Article:** The article "The challenges of soft delete" argues against the common practice of using soft deletes (marking records as deleted with a flag or timestamp rather than removing them). It identifies several key problems: performance degradation as tables accumulate "dead" rows, increased query complexity (the risk of forgetting to filter out deleted records), and the difficulty of maintaining referential integrity and schema consistency in archives. The author suggests alternatives like moving deleted records to a separate archive table or using database triggers to log deletions, emphasizing that while soft deletes seem convenient, they often introduce significant technical debt and operational risks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a nuanced debate on data retention strategies, with users weighing the technical, legal, and analytical trade-offs of soft deletes versus hard deletes.

A primary technical theme is the implementation of alternatives to avoid the pitfalls of soft deletes. Several users suggested moving deleted data to separate collections (in NoSQL) or tables (in relational databases) to keep primary tables lean and performant. For relational databases, views and Row-Level Security (RLS) were highlighted as effective ways to hide soft-deleted records from application code without requiring filters everywhere. Others proposed using table partitions to physically separate active and deleted data while keeping it in the same logical table, or using immutable event-sourcing patterns where "deletion" is just another fact recorded rather than a row removal.

The discussion also heavily focused on the tension between data utility and privacy/compliance. Many argued that "data is never deleted" for business intelligence, auditing, and debugging purposes, noting that historical data is invaluable for analysis. However, this clashes with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate the right to erasure. Users clarified that soft deletes often serve internal moderation needs, while privacy requests require actual anonymization or deletion, necessitating distinct systems for each purpose. Conversely, some noted that data retention laws in certain jurisdictions actually mandate keeping data, making soft deletes or archiving essential.

Finally, participants debated the practicalities of maintaining archived data. Concerns were raised about schema drift—where archived objects become incompatible with the current database schema after updates. However, others countered that archived data is rarely accessed, and when it is, it's usually soon after deletion, minimizing the impact of schema changes. The cultural aspect was also touched upon, with some noting a corporate mindset that treats all data as a permanent asset, while others viewed unbounded data retention as a liability (e.g., security risks, storage costs).

## [SETI@home is in hiberation](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/)
**Score:** 229 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46703301

> **Article:** The article links to the SETI@home website, which announces that the project is now in hibernation. The project has stopped distributing new work units and is in a data analysis phase. This follows the completion of its 21-year run of processing radio telescope data in search of extraterrestrial intelligence. The final data processing has yielded two new scientific papers published in 2025, but no confirmed detection of alien signals.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by nostalgia and personal reflection rather than technical debate. Many commenters recall running SETI@home as a screensaver on older hardware (Pentium II, Pentium 100) during their childhood or teenage years, viewing it as a sci-fi experience and a way to feel involved in science. Several users express a sense of melancholy or wonder about whether the decades of distributed computing were "for nothing," though others point to the recent scientific papers as proof of valid research.

The conversation frequently drifts to related topics:
*   **Comparison to Folding@home:** Users note that Folding@home is still active, though there is debate about its relevance in the age of AI-driven protein structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold).
*   **The "Screensaver Era":** There is a shared sentiment that the decline of screensavers and the rise of low-power CPU modes have made these distributed computing projects less visible or viable than they were in the late 90s/early 2000s.
*   **Cultural Context:** Users associate SETI@home with the *X-Files* era of pop culture, where conspiracy theories and the search for aliens felt more "fun" and less cynical.
*   **Alternatives:** Commenters mention other BOINC projects like climateprediction.net and ask if any current distributed computing projects offer similar visual screensavers, though none are definitively identified as a direct replacement for SETI.

## [Stories removed from the Hacker News Front Page, updated in real time (2024)](https://github.com/vitoplantamura/HackerNewsRemovals)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 151 | **ID:** 46704555

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository that tracks stories removed from the Hacker News front page in real-time. The repository provides logs and archives of these removals, offering transparency into the moderation process by showing which posts have been flagged or taken down.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the nature of Hacker News moderation, the community's tolerance for political and repetitive content, and the effectiveness of the flagging system. A significant portion of the conversation is a defense of the moderation team, particularly "dang," with users expressing gratitude for their efforts in maintaining site quality and preventing the platform from degrading into a political echo chamber or ad-filled space.

However, several users raised concerns about the current state of moderation and content filtering. A key theme is the frustration with the removal of posts that intersect technology and politics. Some commenters argue that in the current era, technology is inherently political and that discussions about figures like Elon Musk or government agencies like ICE are relevant to the tech community. They feel that the "everything is political" label is being used to suppress important, nuanced conversations, and that this apolitical stance is itself a political act.

Another major point of contention is the prevalence of specific topics. Many users expressed fatigue with the constant stream of LLM/AI-related news, comparing it to past naming trends like "i-something" or "cyber-something." There was also a discussion about whether the flagging system is biased, with one user suggesting a pattern where posts critical of right-wing causes are disproportionately flagged, while another countered that left-leaning users might be more likely to post political content on a tech forum in the first place. The conversation also touched on the technical limitations of automated moderation and the desire for more transparency in the flagging process.

## [RSS.Social – the latest and best from small sites across the web](https://rss.social/)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46700503

> **Article:** The article introduces RSS.Social, a new website that aggregates and displays the latest content from a curated list of small, independent websites. It aims to provide a simple, clean interface for discovering new content from the "small web," functioning as an alternative to algorithmic feeds and large social media platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's response to RSS.Social is largely positive, with users appreciating the concept of curated discovery from small personal websites. Several commenters express enthusiasm for tools that help them find new, independent content to follow.

However, the discussion quickly moves into constructive criticism and feature suggestions. The most prominent feedback is a request for content summaries. Users find many titles to be insufficiently descriptive, and clicking on uninteresting links is a major point of friction. Another key suggestion is for the site to verify that linked feeds render correctly in a browser, rather than prompting a file download.

A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the ambiguity of the term "best" in the site's title. Commenters question the curation criteria and suggest the creator provide more clarity on what kind of content is being featured and why. This leads to a broader discussion about the challenges of content curation and subjectivity.

The thread also serves as a hub for sharing related projects and alternatives. Users point to Kagi's Small Web feed (both the standard and "appreciated" versions), indieblog.page, and hcker.news as other tools for discovering small web content. The creator of minifeed.net also shares their own directory and reader, which aggregates over 1300 personal blog feeds. The conversation highlights a clear and active interest in decentralized, human-curated content discovery.

## [Tell HN: Bending Spoons laid off almost everybody at Vimeo yesterday](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707699)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46707699

> **Post:** A user on Hacker News reported that Bending Spoons, the acquirer of Vimeo, has laid off almost all of the company's staff. The post serves as a notification of a significant workforce reduction at the video hosting platform following its recent acquisition.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focused on Bending Spoons' aggressive acquisition and restructuring model, drawing parallels to its previous takeover of Evernote. Commenters noted a consistent pattern: Bending Spoons acquires a company, drastically cuts staff, rewrites the codebase with a small team, and subsequently raises prices while limiting free tiers. Users expressed concern that this strategy prioritizes short-term profit over long-term growth and community health, leading to product degradation and user churn.

Specific concerns were raised regarding the impact on Vimeo's current customers and integrations. Users highlighted that Vimeo hosts critical services like Dropout and Mystery Science Theater 3000, and expressed worry about the stability of these platforms. Several long-time Vimeo subscribers commented that they were canceling their accounts due to price hikes and the uncertainty surrounding the platform's future. The discussion also touched on the potential impact on open-source projects associated with Vimeo, such as the Psalm static analyzer for PHP, though the project's creator clarified it is currently independent.

## [The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns](https://www.nibzard.com/agentic-handbook)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46701969

> **Article:** The article "The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns" is a comprehensive guide that consolidates various techniques and patterns for building and working with AI agents. It aims to standardize the vocabulary and strategies in the emerging field of AI-assisted programming. The handbook covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental agent structures to more complex coordination patterns, providing a structured resource for developers navigating this new landscape. It is presented as a reference for creating production-ready agent systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide in the community's perception of agentic AI, balancing optimism about its potential with significant practical skepticism.

A central theme is the high cognitive overhead and practical difficulties of using agents. Several commenters expressed frustration with the effort required to manage agents, arguing that the cost of preventing them from "going off the rails" and fixing downstream regressions often outweighs the benefits. This led to a broader critique of the industry's hype, with some dismissing the trend as "snake oil" or a grift designed to justify massive capital investment, suggesting that the dream of fully autonomous issue-to-PR pipelines is a "nightmare" in practice.

Conversely, other users defended the technology, framing the current challenges as a natural learning curve. They see value in resources like the handbook for helping developers "learn to harness" these new tools and establish common terminology, similar to how practices like TDD were adopted. Practical advice was shared, such as forcing agents to explain their reasoning before taking irreversible actions, which acts as a crucial "speedbump" to catch errors.

The discussion also touched on the nature of the article itself. While some praised it as a valuable consolidation of patterns, others were highly critical, questioning its readability, the author's expertise, and whether it was simply AI-generated "slop." This skepticism extended to a general weariness with the proliferation of AI-related content and the accusation that any well-written piece must be AI-generated.

Finally, the conversation explored the accessibility of these tools. Some developers feel left behind, still using basic "copy-paste" methods while feeling pressured to adopt complex, agent-specific IDEs. Others countered that the key is simply to "get the flight hours" with a core tool like Claude Code, suggesting that over-complication is the real barrier. The debate also highlighted a perceived gap between non-programmers who can get results and expert programmers who can direct agents, with those in the middle struggling to effectively leverage the technology.

## [The percentage of Show HN posts is increasing, but their scores are decreasing](https://snubi.net/posts/Show-HN/)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46702099

> **Article:** The article analyzes data from Hacker News to show that while the percentage of "Show HN" posts has been steadily increasing over time, their average score has been decreasing. This suggests that although more people are submitting projects to Show HN, these submissions are receiving less engagement or approval from the community on average.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the perceived decline in quality and engagement for Show HN posts, with the proliferation of AI-generated projects being the primary culprit. Many commenters express fatigue with the constant stream of "AI slop," noting that it drowns out genuinely interesting or curious projects and makes it harder to find quality work.

There is a debate about the mechanics and visibility of Show HN. Some users feel the "Show HN" prefix relegates posts to a less-viewed section, limiting their reach, while others argue that the issue isn't the prefix itself but the sheer volume of submissions and the fact that only projects aligning with the HN community's specific interests gain traction.

Underlying this is a broader anxiety about the devaluation of software craftsmanship. Commenters worry that as AI lowers the barrier to creation, the market becomes flooded with mediocre content, making it harder for high-quality work to get attention. This leads to discussions about the rising importance of marketing, trust, and community validation to cut through the noise. A moderator chimes in to clarify that the goal of Show HN is to showcase deep, innovative work for learning, not to serve as a product launch platform, and that moderation efforts are being adjusted to reflect this original intent.

## [Which AI Lies Best? A game theory classic designed by John Nash](https://so-long-sucker.vercel.app/)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46698370

> **Article:** The article presents a research project that uses "So Long Sucker," a 1950 negotiation and betrayal game designed by John Nash, as a benchmark to test the deceptive capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). The study involved 162 games between four models: Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-OSS 120B, Kimi K2, and Qwen3 32B. Key findings suggest that simple benchmarks may underestimate deception, as GPT-OSS dominated in simple games but collapsed in complex ones, while Gemini showed the opposite trend. The study highlights Gemini's ability to construct manipulative strategies, such as an "alliance bank" to trick other players, and to use private reasoning channels to plan betrayals that contradict its public statements. The project includes an interactive demo and full methodology for review.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was multifaceted, with users expressing interest, skepticism, and requests for more information. A primary theme was the accessibility and quality of the project's presentation. Several users reported technical issues with the interactive demo and criticized the "brainless AI writing style" of the article, which they felt detracted from its credibility. There were also repeated requests for clearer game rules, with one user pointing to Wikipedia as a more helpful resource than the project's own explanation.

Technical and methodological points were also raised. One commenter questioned why the "thinking" model in the study never used its internal reasoning tool, finding it odd given the game's deceptive nature. Another expressed disappointment that the study's write-up itself seemed to lean heavily on AI, potentially undermining its authenticity. The original poster responded to feedback by fixing bugs and adding a game rules section.

The conversation also branched into related topics. Users drew parallels to other games that require deception, such as *Diplomacy*, and shared links to academic papers and other YouTube videos where AIs play social deduction games like *Mafia*. These examples were cited as interesting, if unscientific, corroborations of the study's findings, where stronger models are often targeted first. Finally, other benchmarks for testing multi-agent LLM dynamics were shared, expanding the scope of the discussion beyond this specific experiment.

## [Ireland wants to give its cops spyware, ability to crack encrypted messages](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/21/ireland_wants_to_give_police/)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46705715

> **Article:** The article reports that the Irish government is seeking to grant its police force (Gardaí) new powers to use spyware and crack encrypted messages. This move is part of a broader legislative push to modernize surveillance capabilities, citing the need to combat serious crime and terrorism in the digital age. The proposal has sparked significant controversy, raising concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and the potential for government overreach, drawing parallels to similar debates in other jurisdictions like the UK.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the proposed legislation, with commenters expressing fatigue and cynicism towards government surveillance initiatives. The conversation centers on several key themes:

A primary concern is the technical feasibility and societal impact of such powers. Users debate whether it's possible to create encryption that is technologically impossible for governments to break, concluding that the issue is ultimately political rather than technical. The consensus is that governments will simply legislate to compel service providers to create backdoors, effectively negating the purpose of strong encryption.

Many commenters express deep skepticism about the government's motives and competence. They argue that police often fail to utilize existing resources effectively to prevent or solve violent crimes, citing examples of bureaucratic failure and a lack of obligation for police to protect citizens (referencing US court rulings). The sentiment is that these new powers are not about public safety but about expanding state control and surveillance capabilities.

There is a strong sense of a global trend, with users noting that this is not an isolated issue in Ireland but part of a worldwide pattern where states seek to erode digital privacy as technology decentralizes power. Commenters draw comparisons to the UK's surveillance laws and the EU's "Chat Control" proposals, viewing this as a domino effect among Western governments.

Finally, the discussion touches on the practical realities of policing. Some users point out that Ireland is already facing a shortage of frontline officers, and diverting resources to a cyberpolice force seems misguided when basic policing needs are unmet. The overall tone is one of resistance, with users advocating for the continued use of privacy-enhancing technologies and viewing this as another round in the perpetual "cat and mouse game" between privacy advocates and state surveillance.

## [Claude Chill: Fix Claude Code's flickering in terminal](https://github.com/davidbeesley/claude-chill)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46699072

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "claude-chill," a tool created by developer David Beesley. The tool addresses a specific user experience issue with Anthropic's "Claude Code" CLI application: the terminal output flickers excessively during operation, causing visual distraction and discomfort for users. The repository provides a simple fix to stabilize the display.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of relief, humor, and sharp criticism toward Anthropic. The prevailing sentiment is that the existence of this third-party fix highlights a significant gap between the company's ambitious claims about AI coding capabilities and the basic quality of their own developer tools.

Key discussion points include:
*   **Irony and Humor:** Many commenters noted the irony that a company heavily promoting "vibe coding" and AI-generated software cannot fix a basic terminal flickering bug without community intervention. One user humorously summarized the situation as the AI assistant being powerful enough to refactor entire codebases but unable to stop its own interface from looking like a "slot machine."
*   **Criticism of Anthropic's Priorities:** Several users expressed frustration that the bug persists despite being a known issue. This led to speculation that Anthropic's codebase might be messy or that the company is prioritizing new features over fixing fundamental user experience problems. The comparison was drawn to other CLI tools (like OpenCode and Codex) which do not suffer from similar flickering issues.
*   **Skepticism Toward AI Hype:** The incident fueled skepticism regarding the broader narrative that AI will soon write 90% of all code. Critics argued that if a leading AI company cannot polish its own flagship product's UI, it suggests the technology is not as mature as claimed.
*   **Appreciation for the Fix:** On a practical level, users who suffered from the flickering expressed deep gratitude to the developer of "claude-chill," calling it a "legendary" contribution that alleviated their headaches and visual strain.

## [Swedish Alecta has sold off an estimated $8B of US Treasury Bonds](https://www.di.se/nyheter/di-avslojar-alecta-har-dumpat-amerikanska-statspapper/)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46705256

> **Article:** The article reports that Swedish pension fund Alecta has sold off an estimated $8 billion in US Treasury bonds. The original source is a Swedish financial news outlet, di.se. The post itself provides no additional context, but the title implies the sale was motivated by US political factors, likely referencing ongoing concerns about US fiscal policy and political stability among international investors.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the financial and geopolitical implications of Alecta's sale, debating whether the move is a significant signal or a negligible market event. While $8 billion is a fraction of the total US Treasury market, many commenters view it as part of a broader trend of "de-dollarization" or a symbolic shift away from US assets. The conversation explores the practical challenges of moving capital out of US markets, noting that Europe lacks a unified bond market to rival the US. While some argue the sale is insignificant, others warn that even small reductions in demand can affect bond prices, and that larger sell-offs by funds like Norway's could have serious consequences for US borrowing costs and inflation.

Key points include:
*   **Symbolism vs. Scale:** A debate on whether the $8 billion sale is financially meaningful. One side argues it is a tiny fraction of the market and thus irrelevant, while the other sees it as a "first drop" or a significant signal of shifting investor sentiment.
*   **Geopolitical Context:** The sale is linked to a pattern of European pension funds (notably from Denmark) reducing US Treasury holdings, often citing US politics. Commenters speculate this could accelerate if larger funds, like Norway's Government Pension Fund, follow suit.
*   **Alternatives to US Assets:** Users discuss where to reinvest the capital. Options mentioned include European equities, gold, and Chinese assets. A key constraint identified is the lack of a deep, unified European bond market to absorb such capital flows.
*   **Market Mechanics:** Some commenters explain that selling bonds reduces demand, which can slightly lower prices and raise yields. While the impact of $8 billion is minimal, a large-scale sell-off would significantly increase US borrowing costs and inflation.
*   **Broader Economic Trends:** The discussion touches on wider market context, such as high US bond yields compared to recent years and the influence of other global factors (like Japan's bond market) on US Treasury rates.

## [Nested Code Fences in Markdown](https://susam.net/nested-code-fences.html)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 43 | **ID:** 46705201

> **Article:** The article explains how to nest code fences in Markdown. It clarifies that while many users are familiar with the standard triple backticks (```) for code blocks, Markdown actually allows any number of backticks or tildes (minimum three) as delimiters. To nest a code block, one simply uses a fence with more backticks than the inner block. For example, to display a fenced code block that itself contains triple backticks, one would wrap it in four backticks (````). The article provides examples of this technique, demonstrating that it is a standard feature of Markdown designed to handle such edge cases.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News focused on the usability and design of Markdown's nested fence syntax, with a general consensus that while functional, it is unintuitive and prone to implementation errors.

Key themes included:
*   **Criticism of Markdown's Design:** Several users described Markdown's specification as chaotic and full of exceptions. The core complaint was that using the same symbol (backticks or tildes) for both opening and closing tags creates ambiguity. This forces users to manually count delimiters, which is seen as a "silly design" that complicates parsing and authoring.
*   **Alternative Syntax Proposals:** A popular suggestion was to use distinct start and end markers (e.g., `[[[` and `]]]`) to make nesting unambiguous and easier to parse, similar to S-expressions. However, others countered that this introduces its own problems, such as the need to escape those characters if they appear in the code itself, which can be cumbersome for large pasted blocks.
*   **Practical Workarounds and Experiences:** Users shared their own methods for handling this issue. These included using HTML `<pre>` and `<code>` tags, adopting alternative syntaxes like org-mode (`#+BEGIN_SRC`), or implementing custom parsers that enforce stricter rules (e.g., treating ``` as a closing tag only). The technique is also noted as being common in platforms like GitHub for code suggestions and in tools like JupyterBook.
*   **Broader Context:** The conversation touched on related concepts like using `---` as a delimiter (though this conflicts with Markdown's horizontal rule) and the general problem of delimiter-based parsing, with one user suggesting length-prefixing as a more robust alternative.

## [Disaster planning for regular folks (2015)](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/prep/index-old.shtml)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46700809

> **Article:** The article, "Disaster planning for regular folks," is a practical guide to emergency preparedness written by security researcher Michał Zalewski (lcamtuf). It argues that individuals should focus on realistic, high-probability disasters (like power outages, unemployment, or natural disasters) rather than low-probability "end of the world" scenarios. The guide is structured into "problem spaces," ranging from mundane inconveniences to catastrophic societal collapse. For each, it provides actionable advice on essentials like insurance, savings, food and water storage, backup power, communication plans, and self-defense. The core philosophy is to build resilience through common sense, redundancy, and practical skills, emphasizing that preparation for smaller emergencies often provides a robust safety net for larger ones.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's practical approach, with many users sharing personal experiences that underscore its relevance. A key theme is the importance of preparing for mundane, high-probability events over speculative doomsday scenarios. Several commenters noted that their own preparations, such as storing food or having a generator, proved invaluable during common setbacks like job loss or frequent power outages, rather than any apocalyptic event.

The conversation also touched on the psychological and social aspects of preparedness. While some debated the "lone wolf" prepper fantasy versus the need for community, the consensus leaned heavily towards the latter. The idea that "social credit" and strong relationships are more valuable than a stockpile of supplies was highlighted as a crucial long-term strategy for survival.

Current events, particularly the war in Ukraine and increasing climate-related instability, were cited as reasons why the article's advice feels more urgent now than when it was written. Commenters from regions like California shared detailed accounts of infrastructure fragility—from insurance crises to energy instability—making the article's advice feel less like a hobby and more like a necessary contingency plan. The discussion concluded with practical tips and resources, such as using offline knowledge bases (like Kiwix) and following official government preparedness guides.

## [Parliament tells Dutch government to keep DigiD data out of American hands](https://nltimes.nl/2026/01/21/parliament-tells-dutch-govt-keep-digid-data-american-hands)
**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46703928

> **Article:** The Dutch Parliament has passed a motion urging the government to prevent the data of DigiD, the national digital identity system, from falling into American hands. The immediate concern is the potential sale of Solvinity, the private company responsible for running DigiD's underlying infrastructure, to an American investment firm. This raises significant national security and data sovereignty issues, as US laws like the CLOUD Act could potentially compel American entities to provide access to this sensitive data, which is used for everything from tax filing to pension services.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the broader implications of data sovereignty, the specific technical and political context of the Dutch situation, and parallels in other nations. A key point of debate is the distinction between ownership and operation; commenters question whether the Dutch government retains ownership of the infrastructure or if it is fully privatized, which would make reclaiming control much more difficult.

A detailed comment from user Confiks provides crucial context, explaining that while the application layer is managed by a government body (Logius), the underlying infrastructure is owned by Solvinity. This commenter highlights a history of questionable IT procurement decisions, specifically the creation of a non-standard "PICARD/LPC" private cloud solution, which was advised against in favor of a standard Kubernetes platform. This has allegedly created a complex, vendor-locked system that is difficult to untangle.

The discussion broadens to include concerns about other US dependencies in Dutch government services, such as the use of Microsoft Azure, which presents similar risks of data access or service disruption by the US government. The CLOUD Act is frequently cited as the primary legal mechanism through which the US could access this data, regardless of where it is stored. Commenters also draw parallels to Germany, criticizing its political leadership for perceived servitude to US interests and a lack of true digital sovereignty. The conversation also touches on the root causes of government outsourcing in IT, such as the inability of public sector wages to compete with the private sector, forcing reliance on external companies and introducing these inherent risks.
