## [De-dollarization: Is the US dollar losing its dominance? (2025)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/currencies/de-dollarization)
**Score:** 614 | **Comments:** 817 | **ID:** 46693346

> **Article:** The article from J.P. Morgan (dated 2025) analyzes the concept of "de-dollarization," questioning whether the US dollar is losing its status as the world's dominant reserve currency. It likely examines the data regarding the dollar's share of global foreign exchange reserves, which has seen a gradual decline from over 70% in the late 1990s to around 60% in recent years. The article explores the factors contributing to this trend, such as the rise of alternative currencies like the Euro, the implications of the Triffin Dilemma (the link between reserve currency status and trade deficits), and the impact of US fiscal and monetary policies. It also considers the potential effects of political pressures on the Federal Reserve's independence and whether current geopolitical strategies are accelerating a shift toward a multipolar currency system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is heavily focused on the political drivers behind the perceived decline of the dollar, particularly regarding the Trump administration's policies and the independence of the Federal Reserve. Many commenters argue that the dollar's status is being "destroyed on purpose" through erratic trade policies, threats of tariffs, and challenges to the Fed's autonomy. There is a strong sentiment that this unpredictability erodes the trust essential for a reserve currency, prompting a gradual shift away from the dollar rather than an immediate crash.

Economically, the conversation highlights the gradual nature of the decline, noting that the dollar's share of reserves has dropped from 70% to 60% over decades—a trend attributed to the natural emergence of viable alternatives like the Euro. Users discuss the "Triffin Dilemma," acknowledging that the US runs persistent trade deficits partly because the world needs dollars for liquidity. Some debate whether the administration's goal is to intentionally devalue the dollar to boost US exports, though others warn that devaluation through instability carries high costs (inflation, reduced purchasing power) without guaranteed export gains.

Finally, there is speculation about unseen shifts, such as the use of cryptocurrencies for unmeasured "de-dollarization" in illicit markets, though this is countered by the argument that the article focuses on official reserve status. The discussion concludes with a mix of alarm regarding political interference in monetary policy and a more measured view that the shift is a slow, structural evolution rather than a sudden collapse.

## [A 26,000-year astronomical monument hidden in plain sight (2019)](https://longnow.org/ideas/the-26000-year-astronomical-monument-hidden-in-plain-sight/)
**Score:** 528 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46695628

> **Article:** The article from The Long Now Foundation describes the "Clock of the Long Now" project, specifically the prototype built by artist and inventor Danny Hillis. This mechanical clock is designed to keep time for 10,000 years, located inside a mountain in Texas. The piece focuses on the engineering challenges and philosophical motivations behind creating a device that can accurately measure deep time, serving as a symbol of long-term thinking and a challenge to humanity's short-term perspective. It details the clock's mechanisms, which use a combination of standard and specialized materials to minimize wear and require active maintenance to function, ensuring future generations remain engaged with it.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, with commenters exploring themes of deep time, historical context, and the nature of legacy. A significant portion of the conversation focused on the astronomical aspects of the clock's design, particularly the precession of the equinoxes. Users shared knowledge about how the Earth's axial wobble changes which star is the "North Star" over millennia, citing historical examples like Thuban and Polaris, and connecting this to broader scientific concepts like Milankovitch cycles.

There was also a notable thread on the cultural and psychological drivers behind such long-term projects. Commenters contrasted the deliberate, thoughtful construction of historical monuments with modern architecture, which is often perceived as being optimized for speed and efficiency rather than longevity. This led to speculation that ancient peoples, with fewer distractions and a greater reliance on celestial cycles for survival, were more attuned to the sky and motivated to encode astronomical knowledge into their structures.

Finally, the discussion touched upon the human element of discovery and legacy. Some users expressed a sense of wonder at the ingenuity of the project, while others reflected on the challenge of creating lasting meaning in an age of information overload and AI-generated content. The conversation also included practical notes, such as a correction that celestial navigation is not solely dependent on a single pole star, and personal anecdotes about visiting other monumental structures like the Hoover Dam.

## [Anthropic's original take home assignment open sourced](https://github.com/anthropics/original_performance_takehome)
**Score:** 507 | **Comments:** 244 | **ID:** 46700594

> **Article:** Anthropic has open-sourced its original performance take-home assignment for engineering candidates. The task involves optimizing a simulated kernel in Python to minimize execution cycles, using a provided simulator and Chrome tracing tools for profiling. The challenge is designed to test low-level optimization skills, with the README noting that beating the performance of their best internal solution (Claude Opus 4.5 at launch) warrants a discussion with their recruiting team.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, focusing on the nature of the assignment, the hiring philosophy it represents, and broader sentiments about Anthropic.

A primary theme is the debate over what this type of assignment selects for. Some commenters see it as a legitimate and interesting test of deep technical knowledge, particularly in hardware, compiler optimizations, and GPU architecture (specifically polyhedral layout algebra). They appreciate that it's a focused performance challenge rather than a generic web app project. Others, however, argue it's a narrow test that favors "nerds" with specific domain knowledge over broader creativity, which they believe is harder to assess in a short, timed challenge.

There is also significant discussion around the tone of the assignment. The challenge to beat their internal model's performance was interpreted by some as arrogant or "pompous," reflecting negatively on Anthropic's company culture. This sentiment is amplified by users expressing general distrust or dislike for the company.

Finally, the conversation touches on practical aspects. Some users are actively working on the problem and sharing their experiences, while others question the time commitment for a take-home assignment. A tangential but notable thread discusses the performance of AI coding assistants, with one user joking that the assignment is a "DDOS attack" on other models and others sharing frustrations with Gemini's performance on complex tasks.

## [EU–INC – A new pan-European legal entity](https://www.eu-inc.org/)
**Score:** 491 | **Comments:** 476 | **ID:** 46703763

> **Article:** The article links to a proposal for "EU-Inc," a new pan-European legal entity championed by the European Commission. The initiative aims to create a single, simple set of rules for companies to register and operate seamlessly across all EU member states. The stated goals are to allow entrepreneurs to register a company online within 48 hours, establish a uniform capital regime without minimum requirements (unlike the existing European Company - SE), and facilitate cross-border business and investment. The proposal is presented as part of a broader strategy to create a "Savings and Investment Union" and an integrated energy market, with a target implementation date of 2027.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is mixed, with users expressing cautious optimism alongside skepticism about the proposal's novelty and implementation.

A central theme is the perceived difficulty of starting and running a business in certain EU countries, particularly Germany. Several commenters shared personal experiences of bureaucratic hurdles, high costs, and complex regulations. However, others countered this by citing their own easy experiences in countries like Sweden, the UK, and Estonia, suggesting the problem is more national than pan-European.

There is significant debate about the actual value of EU-Inc. While some see it as a revolutionary step for cross-border operations, others view the ease of registration as a solved problem in many jurisdictions. The key benefit, for some, would be simplifying ongoing operations like hiring, taxation, and compliance across different member states.

Technical and political concerns were also raised. One commenter questioned whether the proposal would be implemented as a "directive" (requiring national interpretation, like GDPR) or a "regulation" (directly applicable law), with skepticism that a directive would create more complexity than it solves. Another pointed out that the official proposal website appears to be built with a commercial tool (Framer), which raised questions about its official status.

Finally, the discussion briefly touched on related topics mentioned in the source speech, such as the EU-Mercosur trade agreement and the controversial EU energy market unification, with one user calling the latter "catastrophic" for Sweden.

## [California is free of drought for the first time in 25 years](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-09/california-has-no-areas-of-dryness-first-time-in-25-years)
**Score:** 427 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46698660

> **Article:** The article reports that California is officially free of drought for the first time in 25 years, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. This follows a period of heavy rainfall and snowfall that has replenished reservoirs and soil moisture across the state, ending years of severe water restrictions and dry conditions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a cautious and context-rich response to the news, focusing on historical patterns, infrastructure, and regional disparities.

**Cyclical Nature of Drought**
Many commenters, citing John Steinbeck's *East of Eden*, emphasize that California's climate is historically cyclical, characterized by long periods of drought interspersed with wet years. There is a strong consensus that the current relief is likely temporary and that the state must not forget the "dry years" during the "wet years." Some users also pointed to the threat of extreme rainfall events (ARkStorm scenarios) that pose different, but equally severe, risks.

**Infrastructure and Water Management**
A debate emerged regarding California's water infrastructure. One user argued that the state's failure to build new dams is the primary cause of water shortages. However, others countered that the best sites for dams are already utilized, and that dams come with significant environmental and financial costs. They noted that drought cannot be solved by storage alone if precipitation is low for multiple years.

**Climate and Snowpack Concerns**
Several long-time residents expressed skepticism about the long-term viability of this drought-free status. They noted that the current winter has been unusually warm, leading to lower snowpack despite high rainfall. Since California's water supply relies heavily on gradual snowmelt into the summer, low snow levels could result in water shortages later in the year, even if reservoirs are currently full.

**Economic and Regional Perspectives**
Commenters highlighted that water rates remain high despite the end of the drought, attributing this to the fixed costs of water delivery and sewage systems rather than the volume of rainfall. Additionally, users noted that while California is drought-free, other parts of the U.S. (such as Colorado and Utah) are currently experiencing severe dry conditions, challenging the narrative that the drought crisis is over nationwide.

## [cURL removes bug bounties](https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html)
**Score:** 350 | **Comments:** 193 | **ID:** 46701733

> **Article:** The article reports that the cURL project has discontinued its bug bounty program on HackerOne. The decision was made due to an overwhelming influx of low-quality, automated, and often nonsensical security reports, referred to as "slop." These submissions, increasingly generated by AI tools, are flooding the project's intake system, making it difficult and time-consuming for maintainers to identify legitimate vulnerabilities. The sheer volume of noise has rendered the bug bounty program unsustainable for the project's volunteer maintainers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters expressing both frustration and sympathy for the cURL team's position. The consensus is that AI tools have dramatically exacerbated the problem of low-quality bug bounty submissions. Several users shared personal anecdotes of receiving AI-generated security reports filled with false positives and nonsensical findings, confirming this is a widespread issue beyond just cURL.

A key theme is the debate over how to solve this "slop" problem. One popular suggestion was to implement an entry fee for submissions, which would be refunded if the report proves to be valid. This was framed as a way to create a barrier to entry and deter bad-faith actors. However, others countered that this might also deter legitimate, less experienced researchers. Another proposed solution was to use AI to filter out the AI-generated slop, though this was met with some skepticism about its effectiveness and the ironic nature of the "fight fire with fire" approach.

The conversation also explored the motivations behind these spam submissions. While financial incentives from bounties are a clear driver, commenters noted that the desire to build a reputation as a "security expert" by listing public submissions on a resume is another powerful motivator, one that won't disappear with the removal of bounties. Ultimately, the discussion concluded that this is a human problem enabled by new technology, where the low cost of generating and submitting reports has overwhelmed the capacity of open-source projects to manage them.

## [Meta's legal team abandoned its ethical duties](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/how-metas-lawyers-perfected-the-playbook)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 201 | **ID:** 46694378

> **Article:** The article argues that Meta's legal team has systematically abandoned its ethical duties, transforming from advisors into strategic enablers of corporate harm. It claims that instead of upholding the law, Meta's lawyers perfected a playbook for suppressing evidence, exploiting legal loopholes, and using attorney-client privilege to shield unethical or illegal activities from scrutiny. The piece frames this as a broader corrosion of the legal profession's integrity, where the pursuit of profit has overridden the duty to the public and the justice system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Meta and the broader corporate culture it represents, though it branches into several distinct themes. The dominant sentiment is one of deep cynicism and confirmation bias, with many commenters expressing that the article's claims are unsurprising and that Meta's reputation for unethical behavior is well-established. Several users recommend the book "Careless People" for a deeper look into the company's internal culture, with one parent sharing the difficult real-world challenge of shielding children from addictive social media platforms and the resulting social friction.

The conversation broadened into a critique of modern capitalism, with commenters arguing that the prioritization of shareholder value above all else—including ethics and public well-being—is a systemic issue in US corporations, citing United Healthcare as another example. This led to a philosophical debate on corporate responsibility, with some arguing that this profit-first mindset is a choice that society and law could change, rather than an immutable law of nature.

A notable point of contention arose from a dissenting comment that defended Meta's actions as standard, ethical legal practice—such as minimizing legal risk and deleting non-essential data. This view was met with sharp criticism from others who found the interpretation to be disingenuous and a perfect example of the "bad faith" arguments the original article described. Finally, a former Facebook employee corroborated the article's claims, stating that a culture of prioritizing performance metrics over ethics was pervasive not just in the legal team, but among engineers and product managers as well.

## [IPv6 is not insecure because it lacks a NAT](https://www.johnmaguire.me/blog/ipv6-is-not-insecure-because-it-lacks-nat/)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 376 | **ID:** 46696303

> **Article:** The article argues that the common belief that IPv6 is insecure because it lacks Network Address Translation (NAT) is a misconception. The author clarifies that NAT was primarily implemented in IPv4 to solve address exhaustion, not for security. While NAT provides a side effect of obscuring internal network topology and blocking unsolicited inbound traffic by default, this is actually the function of a stateful firewall, which is a separate mechanism. The article asserts that IPv6 can be just as secure as IPv4, provided that modern routers implement a stateful firewall by default, which is the standard practice. It emphasizes that security should be managed through explicit firewall rules rather than relying on the accidental byproduct of address translation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a nuanced debate, moving beyond a simple "NAT is/isn't security" binary. The consensus is that NAT itself is not a security feature, but its common implementation in home routers inherently includes a stateful firewall that blocks unsolicited inbound traffic, which users perceive as a security benefit.

Key points of contention and clarification include:
*   **NAT vs. Firewall:** Many commenters distinguish between NAT and the stateful firewall that typically accompanies it. They argue that the security benefit comes from the firewall's default-deny policy for inbound connections, not the address translation itself. IPv6 can achieve the same level of security with a properly configured firewall.
*   **Router Defaults and User Responsibility:** A major concern is whether IPv6 routers will ship with a default-deny firewall enabled. Commenters express a need for this to be the standard, as the vast address space of IPv6 means every device could be directly exposed to the internet if unprotected. The risk is that a user might disable their firewall, exposing all devices, whereas with IPv4/NAT, only one device (the one in a DMZ) would typically be exposed.
*   **Practical Implementation and Misconceptions:** Some commenters share experiences of misconfigured networks where IPv6 was enabled without a firewall, leading to security breaches. Others point out that IPv6 NAT (NAT66) does exist but is uncommon and typically used in specific scenarios (e.g., with Unique Local Addresses). The discussion also touches on the fact that some ISPs still only provide a single IPv6 address, forcing users into a NAT-like configuration.
*   **Obfuscation and Attack Surface:** One perspective is that IPv4's NAT provides a layer of obfuscation, as internal IP addresses (like 192.168.0.1) are not routable from the internet. In contrast, a public IPv6 address is globally unique and potentially reveals more information. However, others counter that this is not a true security feature and that the sheer size of the IPv6 address space makes scanning for targets infeasible.
*   **Real-World Constraints:** A pragmatic point is raised that even if IPv6 is technically secure, auditors and corporate policies may still favor IPv4 with NAT due to long-held beliefs, creating a barrier to adoption.

## [How AI destroys institutions](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/publications/how-ai-destroys-institutions/)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46705606

> **Article:** The article, "How AI Destroys Institutions," argues that AI poses an existential threat to purpose-driven institutions like higher education, medicine, and law. The author posits that these institutions function by creating stable, predictable patterns that reduce chaos and enable complex societal tasks. AI, particularly generative AI, undermines these structures by offering frictionless, individualized shortcuts that bypass the rigorous, collective processes these institutions are built on. By making it easy to bypass established norms and expertise, AI erodes the shared intellectual and professional standards that give these institutions their authority and purpose, ultimately leading to their decay.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical and skeptical of the article's thesis and academic rigor. A primary point of contention is the paper's quality; several commenters point out that it is a draft, not peer-reviewed, and contains basic errors like misspellings and duplicate punctuation, which undermine its credibility. One commenter specifically critiques the paper's research, claiming its example of the FDA using AI is based on a misinterpreted news article rather than primary sources, suggesting the work is more of an opinion piece than a well-researched academic paper.

Beyond the paper's quality, many commenters challenge the core argument itself. A recurring theme is that the article misattributes blame. Instead of AI being the primary destructive force, several users argue that AI's appeal is a symptom of pre-existing institutional failure. They contend that institutions like medicine and education have already become overly complex, expensive, and inaccessible, creating a vacuum that AI fills due to its low cost and ease of use. In this view, AI isn't destroying healthy institutions but rather accelerating the decay of ones that were already failing to meet societal needs.

The discussion also branches into broader philosophical and cynical takes. Some commenters dismiss the premise as an "anti-tech conspiracy" from fields like law that feel threatened by automation. Others see the phenomenon as an inevitable byproduct of any major technological revolution, which historically involves disruption and upheaval. There is also a more fatalistic perspective that institutions like the free press were already "fatally wounded" by previous technologies like social media, making AI's impact a continuation of an existing trend rather than a new threat.

## [The Unix Pipe Card Game](https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/)
**Score:** 244 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46694124

> **Article:** The article links to "The Unix Pipe Card Game," a physical card game created by punkx.org. The game is designed to teach the concept of Unix pipes and command-line utilities in a tangible, hands-on format. It appears to be a creative educational tool that translates the digital concept of piping commands (e.g., `command1 | command2`) into a physical card-based activity. The post also notes that the physical version is currently sold out.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a split between appreciation for the concept and skepticism about its practical format, particularly for its stated goal of teaching Unix pipes.

A central theme is the debate over the best method for learning. One commenter, a science teacher, argued that while the physical game is cute, it lacks the immediate, experimental feedback of a digital environment. They believe true learning comes from interacting with a live terminal where one can see the instant results of a command, discovering functionality through trial and error. This view was challenged by another user who cited research suggesting that the "trial and error" method can be frustrating and ineffective for many, and that a more structured, guided approach might be better.

The game's creator, jackdoe, provided crucial context, explaining that the game was primarily created as a physical aid to teach his daughter. It serves as a "play once" icebreaker to introduce concepts before moving to a real terminal, helping to visualize how independent commands can be chained together. This reframes the game not as a standalone learning tool, but as a conversational starter for a parent-child activity.

Other comments touched on:
*   **Alternatives:** Users pointed to online versions of similar card games and text-based "wargames" like OverThe-Wire's Bandit as more practical, interactive learning tools.
*   **Nostalgia and Professional Experience:** Some commenters shared stories of colleagues with legendary command-line skills and expressed a wish for better tools to learn these essential IT skills.
*   **Technical Evolution:** A brief tangent discussed the limitations of traditional Unix pipes (transferring text) and mentioned modern shells like Nushell that handle structured data, making pipelines more powerful.

## [Instabridge has acquired Nova Launcher](https://novalauncher.com/nova-is-here-to-stay)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46696357

> **Article:** The article announces that Instabridge has acquired Nova Launcher. The linked post from Nova Launcher's official site, titled "Nova is here to stay," attempts to reassure users about the future of the app, promising to keep data collection minimal and stating that Nova Prime will remain ad-free. However, the announcement comes shortly after the original creator, Kevin Barry, left the project following the acquisition by Branch Metrics (Instabridge's parent company), and after the company had previously added Facebook and Google Ads tracking to the app.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and negative regarding the acquisition and the future of Nova Launcher. Users frequently cite the recent addition of tracking code and the departure of the original developer as evidence that the app is undergoing "enshittification." There is significant distrust toward the new ownership's promises, particularly regarding data privacy and the potential introduction of ads, with commenters noting that "anonymized" data is often still sold.

Many users are actively seeking alternatives, with open-source options like Lawnchair and niche launchers like AIO Launcher being recommended. The timeline of events—acquisition by Branch Metrics in 2022, layoffs in August 2024, and the founder's departure in September 2025—is highlighted to illustrate the decline of the app's independence. The general sentiment is that the "Nova is here to stay" messaging is corporate speak that often precedes a product's degradation or discontinuation.

## [The challenges of soft delete](https://atlas9.dev/blog/soft-delete.html)
**Score:** 223 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46698061

> **Article:** The article "The challenges of soft delete" explores the common practice of marking records as deleted (e.g., via a `deleted_at` timestamp) rather than physically removing them from the database. While soft delete offers benefits like easy data recovery and maintaining historical context, the article argues it introduces significant technical debt. Key challenges include query complexity (constantly needing to filter out deleted rows), performance degradation as tables fill with inactive data, and the difficulty of managing database constraints and indexes. The author suggests that a more robust approach is to physically move deleted records to a separate archive table or database. This keeps the primary table lean and performant while still preserving the data for recovery or compliance needs, albeit at the cost of increased architectural complexity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep split on the utility of soft delete, largely influenced by the specific domain (e.g., banking vs. social media) and database technology (SQL vs. NoSQL).

Several users advocate for alternatives to traditional soft delete. A popular suggestion is using database views or Row-Level Security (RLS) to hide soft-deleted records from application queries by default, which simplifies application logic. Another approach, particularly for NoSQL, is physically moving deleted documents to a separate "archive" collection, which avoids performance issues and the risk of forgetting to filter. For relational databases, some propose using table partitioning to achieve a similar effect, keeping active and deleted data in the same logical table but physically separated.

The debate is heavily framed by legal and compliance requirements. Privacy regulations like CCPA are cited as a strong argument *against* soft delete, as they mandate the actual erasure of personal data. Conversely, data retention laws in some regions are seen as a reason *for* soft delete, as they prevent the deletion of certain records. A distinction is made between marking data as hidden for moderation (a soft delete use case) and fully anonymizing it for a privacy request.

Performance is a central theme. While some argue that with proper indexing the performance impact is negligible, others share experiences where tables with 50-70% soft-deleted rows caused noticeable slowdowns. The "toxic asset" concept was raised, highlighting the security risks and maintenance costs of retaining data indefinitely.

Finally, the cultural aspect was noted. One user shared an anecdote of a professor who insisted "data is never deleted" in the business world, reflecting a common mindset that prioritizes data preservation for future analysis. However, others countered that destroying facts is sometimes necessary and that un-delete functionality is rarely used in practice, making the complexity of soft delete hard to justify.

## ['The old order is not coming back,' Carney says in speech at Davos](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-davos-speech-9.7052725)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 238 | **ID:** 46694482

> **Article:** In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney declared that the "old order" of the post-World War II rules-based international system is not returning. He argued that this system was always a partial fiction, where the most powerful nations exempted themselves from rules while enforcing them asymmetrically on others. Carney stated that the era of great power rivalry has replaced the era of cooperation, urging middle powers to develop strategic autonomy in energy, finance, and supply chains rather than relying on an unreliable United States. He called for a clear-eyed recognition of the new reality of power-based competition.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding Carney's speech centers on the geopolitical realignment away from the United States and the implications for middle powers, particularly Canada. Commenters largely view the speech as a necessary and honest acknowledgment of a fractured global order, driven largely by the instability of US foreign policy under the Trump administration.

A dominant theme is the formation of a "middle power alliance" independent of the US. Users suggest that nations like Canada, EU members, and others must organize economically and militarily to avoid being exploited by larger powers. There is specific discussion about shifting defense spending away from US-manufactured weaponry toward domestic or collaborative middle-power defense industries, modeled on Ukraine's use of smaller, cost-effective technology.

Many commenters frame the speech as a direct response to American aggression, specifically citing Trump's threats to annex Canada and Greenland. The consensus is that the US has become an unreliable partner, and Carney's direct language—criticizing the "sham" of the current order—signals a significant shift in diplomatic discourse. Users note that allies no longer fear speaking truth to American power because the damage to the alliance is already done.

There is also a historical debate comparing the current geopolitical split to the 1930s. While one user drew parallels to the Stalin-Hitler alliance, others countered that the situation more closely resembles the Sino-Soviet split, suggesting potential opportunities for Europe to ally with China against a hostile US-Russia axis.

Finally, the discussion touches on the domestic political context. Some users critique Carney’s background as a banker, while others defend his competence compared to Trump. There is an acknowledgment that the global shift toward protectionism and nationalism will come at a cost to the average citizen through higher prices and austerity, but the prevailing sentiment is that this pain is preferable to subjugation by a superpower.

## [Show HN: Mastra 1.0, open-source JavaScript agent framework from the Gatsby devs](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46693959

> **Project:** Mastra 1.0 is an open-source TypeScript agent framework built by the team behind Gatsby. It is designed to be TypeScript-native, providing a developer-friendly experience for building and deploying AI agents. The framework offers primitives for creating agent hierarchies, workflows, and multi-agent networks, aiming to be a production-grade solution without vendor lock-in.
>
> **Discussion:** The launch was met with a positive reception, with users praising the framework's TypeScript-first design and developer experience. A key discussion point was the value of using a dedicated framework versus building a custom solution or using alternatives like LangChain. The creators and users argued that Mastra allows teams to focus on the agent logic itself rather than maintaining an internal framework, citing the Brex CTO's adoption as a third-party endorsement.

Technical concerns were raised about potential platform lock-in, even with an open-source harness, and the long-term dominance of specific model SDKs like Claude's. The creators responded by highlighting their commitment to open-source control and future primitives like sandboxes and skills. A specific feature, the `.network()` method for creating dynamic multi-agent systems, also drew interest. Off-topic, a brief conversation emerged about the team's use of AI for code generation, particularly for templatized tasks.

## [The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns](https://www.nibzard.com/agentic-handbook)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46701969

> **Article:** The article "The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns" is a comprehensive guide that consolidates various techniques and patterns for building and working with AI agents. It aims to standardize the vocabulary and strategies in the emerging field of AI-assisted programming, covering topics from agent coordination to practical implementation patterns. The resource is presented as a website and an associated GitHub repository.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant divide in the community's perception of agentic AI. On one side, there is appreciation for the article as a valuable consolidation of emerging patterns. Commenters like MrOrelliOReilly and Kerrick see the need for standardized terminology to articulate best practices, similar to established concepts like TDD, and welcome the resource for helping developers harness these new tools.

However, the dominant sentiment is one of deep skepticism and frustration. A recurring theme is the high "cognitive cost" and practical difficulty of using agents. Commenters argue that the overhead of managing agents—preventing them from "going off the rails" and fixing their downstream errors—often outweighs the benefits. The dream of a fully automated "Issue → Pull Request" workflow is dismissed by many as a "nightmare" of regressions and chaos.

This skepticism extends to the article itself and the broader "AI agent" industry. Some users dismiss the handbook as "snake oil" or "slop," suggesting it's more about hype than substance, with one user sarcastically describing the trend as "shouting at the AI" with complex prompts. There's a strong preference for simpler, more direct tools like Claude Code over elaborate agent frameworks, with the advice being to gain "flight hours" with practical tools rather than getting bogged down in theory. The discussion also touches on the meta-nature of the content, with some noting the irony of an AI-written article about AI, while others find such comments tedious. Ultimately, the conversation reflects a community grappling with the practical realities of a technology that is simultaneously hyped and difficult to master.

The repository tracks and archives posts that were on the HN front page but were subsequently removed, likely due to moderator action or community flagging. It provides a real-time or frequently updated log of these removals, offering transparency into what content is being taken down from the site's front page.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the nature of HN moderation, the community's tolerance for specific topics, and the role of politics on the platform. A key theme is the tension between maintaining a focused technical forum and discussing the real-world implications of technology.

Several users express frustration with the current state of moderation. One user feels that important tech-related debates are being "silenced by mass flagging," particularly those with any political angle, such as discussions about Elon Musk or X. This sentiment is supported by another who observes a pattern in flagging, suggesting that content critical of right-wing causes or specific figures like Musk is disproportionately targeted. This has led to a feeling that nearly any significant topic can be dismissed as "political" and removed.

Conversely, other users defend the strict moderation. One commenter expresses sympathy for the moderators ("dang"), noting that HN relies on automated systems and flagging that may not always work perfectly. Another user is glad the flagging system exists, stating a desire to keep the site free of "political echo chamber articles," even if they agree with the sentiment. This highlights a "silent majority" that prefers to avoid political discourse entirely.

There is also a debate about the definition of "political" in a tech context. One user argues that since technology now drives politics, it's impossible to separate the two, and that ignoring this is "dangerful." Another counters that while everything is inherently political, the site should primarily focus on the technology itself.

Finally, the discussion touches on topic fatigue. Users note being tired of the constant stream of LLM-related news and the repetitive naming trends in tech products (e.g., "e-something," "i-something"). There is also a general appreciation for the moderation team's efforts in maintaining community quality, with some users stating they value the site enough to pay for it.

## [SETI@home is in hiberation](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46703301

> **Article:** The article links to the SETI@home website, which announces that the project is now in hibernation. The project, which used distributed computing to analyze radio telescope data for signs of extraterrestrial life, has stopped distributing new work. This follows the completion of data processing for the Arecibo Observatory data, with final results recently published in a scientific paper.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a nostalgic reflection on the SETI@home project, with users sharing personal memories of running the distinctive screensaver on old hardware like Pentium II and Pentium 4 computers. Many commenters expressed a sense of wonder and contribution as children or teenagers, hoping their computer might be the one to discover aliens. There is a mix of feelings about the project's outcome; while some express disappointment that no signal was found, others reframe the negative result as valuable scientific knowledge.

The conversation also pivots to the current state of similar distributed computing projects. Users note that Folding@home is still active, though one commenter questions its relevance in the age of AI-driven protein folding models like AlphaFold. Other BOINC projects, such as climateprediction.net, are also mentioned as still operating. The thread concludes with a sense of loss for the era of scientific screensavers and a question about modern alternatives for alien searching.

## [Which AI Lies Best? A game theory classic designed by John Nash](https://so-long-sucker.vercel.app/)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46698370

> **Article:** The article presents a study that uses "So Long Sucker," a 1950 negotiation and betrayal game designed by John Nash, as a benchmark to test deception capabilities in modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Researchers ran 162 games featuring four AI models (Gemini 3 Flash, GPT-OSS 120B, Kimi K2, and Qwen3 32B) against each other, analyzing over 15,000 decisions. The study's key findings suggest that simple benchmarks underestimate deceptive capabilities; for instance, GPT-OSS performed well in simple games but poorly in complex ones, while Gemini showed the opposite trend. The report highlights Gemini's ability to use "alliance bank" manipulation—making technically true but strategically misleading statements—and notes a discrepancy between its private internal reasoning and public messages, a trait not observed in GPT-OSS. The findings imply that AI honesty may be situational, depending on the perceived capability of its opponents. The project includes an interactive demo and full methodology for public review.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of enthusiasm for the research concept and significant criticism regarding its execution and presentation. Many commenters found the use of "So Long Sucker" to be a fascinating and appropriate choice for testing deception, with several suggesting similar applications in games like Diplomacy or referencing other AI social experiments (such as AI Mafia videos on YouTube). However, the technical implementation of the project received heavy criticism. Multiple users reported that the interactive demo was buggy, with issues like the game not progressing and bots repeating themselves, leading to a lack of trust in the reported outcomes. The presentation of the findings was also criticized for using a "brainless AI writing style," which detracted from its credibility.

Other key points of discussion included a request for clearer game rules and a video explanation, questions about the lack of an academic paper, and a request for easier access to the raw game logs. The author was active in the thread, responding to feedback by fixing bugs and adding a rules section. Overall, while the community was intrigued by the premise and potential of using game theory to benchmark AI deception, the execution of the presented project was seen as flawed and in need of refinement.

## [RSS.Social – the latest and best from small sites across the web](https://rss.social/)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46700503

> **Article:** The article links to RSS.Social, a new website that aggregates content from small, independent websites. The service appears to curate a feed of the "latest and best" posts from these sources, aiming to help users discover content outside of major platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community generally welcomed the concept of a curated feed for the small web, with several users expressing enthusiasm for discovering content from personal sites. However, the discussion highlighted several areas for improvement and alternative solutions.

Key feedback for RSS.Social included:
*   **Usability improvements:** Users suggested adding 1-2 sentence summaries to titles to help with content discovery and reduce "click fatigue."
*   **Technical concerns:** One user noted issues with feed validation and resource loading, while another reported being blocked by Cloudflare, raising questions about geoblocking or security configurations.
*   **Curation transparency:** The term "best" was called out as subjective. Commenters asked for a clearer description of the curation criteria or editorial voice to understand what kind of content is prioritized.

The conversation also pivoted to existing alternatives for browsing the small web:
*   **Kagi Small Web:** Several users highlighted Kagi's Small Web feature (accessible via `hcker.news` or direct feeds), which filters HN submissions to personal sites. Users shared specific feed URLs for "appreciated" articles, videos, and code.
*   **Other Tools:** Users mentioned `indieblog.page` for random blog discovery and `minifeed.net` as another directory and reader for personal blogs.

Overall, the sentiment was positive toward the goal of revitalizing RSS and the small web, with constructive suggestions on how to make discovery more effective.

## ['This is sell America' – US dollar tumbles as globe flees US assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/sell-america-trade-dollar-treasury-gold-us-trump-greenland.html)
**Score:** 164 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46695061

> **Article:** The CNBC article, dated January 20, 2026, reports on a significant downturn in the US dollar and a sell-off of US assets, a phenomenon the article labels the "Sell America" trade. This trend is attributed to a global loss of confidence in the United States, driven by the Trump administration's aggressive and unpredictable economic and foreign policies. Key factors cited include the imposition of massive tariffs, threats of military action against allies like Canada and Greenland, and a growing perception that the US is becoming an unreliable and isolationist partner. The article suggests that international investors are fleeing the perceived risk of US assets, seeking safer havens and contributing to a potential de-dollarization trend.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the Trump administration's policies, viewing the "Sell America" trend as a direct and predictable consequence of its actions. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Policy and Geopolitical Fallout:** Commenters directly link the economic turmoil to specific policies, such as imposing tariffs on allies and threatening military action. There is a strong sense that the US is alienating its closest partners, with one user pointing to a speech by Canadian Prime Minister Carney as evidence of this fractured relationship. The administration's hostile rhetoric towards NATO is also highlighted as a major factor eroding trust and positioning the US as an adversary to its own allies.

*   **Investment and Economic Strategy:** A significant portion of the discussion revolves around personal investment strategies in response to the perceived decline of US assets. Some users express a shift away from US-focused funds (like VOO) towards international equities (VXUS) and traditional hedges like gold. However, there is a debate on the effectiveness of these hedges, with one user arguing that for those living and banking in the US, a global downturn caused by a trade war would impact all assets, suggesting a "stay the course" strategy might be more viable for long-term investors.

*   **Political Accountability and Fear:** The discussion is charged with political frustration and anxiety. Many commenters express dismay at the lack of opposition from Republican legislators, viewing their silence as complicity in policies they see as unconstitutional, economically damaging, and dangerous. There is a palpable fear of further escalation, with one user expressing genuine concern about the potential for the administration's behavior to lead to catastrophic events, such as the use of nuclear weapons. The low approval rating of the administration is cited as a reason for the political inaction.

*   **Sarcasm and Irony:** The tone is often cynical and sarcastic. Users make ironic remarks about the administration's narrative-shifting ("We've always been at war with NATO"), blame-voting ("Thanks everyone who voted for this!"), and the likelihood of the White House blaming the previous administration for the current economic fallout.
