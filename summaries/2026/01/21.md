## [Danish pension fund divesting US Treasuries](https://www.reuters.com/business/danish-pension-fund-divest-its-us-treasuries-2026-01-20/)
**Score:** 714 | **Comments:** 720 | **ID:** 46692594

> **Article:** A Danish pension fund, AkademikerPension, has announced its decision to divest from US Treasuries, citing poor US government finances and the need to find alternative liquidity and risk management strategies. The fund is selling approximately $100 million in holdings, a relatively small amount in the context of the multi-trillion-dollar daily Treasury market, but the move is being viewed as a symbolic indicator of shifting investor sentiment toward US fiscal policy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely dismisses the direct financial impact of the $100 million divestment, noting that it is a "drop in the bucket" compared to the daily trading volume of US Treasuries. However, commenters view the move as significant symbolism that could signal a broader trend if other funds follow suit.

The conversation quickly pivots to the underlying reasons for the divestment: US fiscal health and political stability. Several users pointed to the US debt ceiling debates and lack of political will to address the national debt. A debate emerged regarding the causes of the deficit, with some blaming recent tax cuts and others citing historical shocks like 9/11, the Iraq War, and COVID-19.

There is a strong political undercurrent in the comments, with many blaming the Trump administration for creating global instability and eroding trust in US institutions. This led to broader geopolitical discussions about the future of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. While some argued this status is protected by US military power (the "US Navy" argument), others warned that the "weaponization" of the financial system—such as freezing assets—encourages allies to seek alternatives, citing recent diplomatic overtures between Europe, Canada, and China as evidence of a shifting global order.

## [De-dollarization: Is the US dollar losing its dominance? (2025)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/currencies/de-dollarization)
**Score:** 603 | **Comments:** 800 | **ID:** 46693346

> **Article:** The J.P. Morgan article analyzes the trend of de-dollarization, examining whether the US dollar is losing its status as the world's dominant reserve currency. It likely explores the factors contributing to this potential shift, such as geopolitical tensions, the rise of alternative currencies like the Euro and the Chinese yuan, and the impact of US fiscal and monetary policies on global trust in the dollar.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the causes and implications of the dollar's potential decline. A dominant theme is the political blame game, with many commenters directly attributing the erosion of dollar dominance to the Trump administration's policies, describing it as either intentional destruction or a result of unpredictable governance. Others counter that this is a gradual, long-term trend predating the current administration, citing the dollar's falling share of global reserves (from over 70% in the 1990s to around 60% today) and the emergence of viable alternatives like the Euro.

Several users introduced key economic concepts to frame the debate. The Triffin Dilemma was mentioned to explain the inherent link between a reserve currency's status and the issuing country's persistent trade deficits. There was also discussion on whether a weaker dollar is a strategic goal to make US goods more competitive, with some arguing that the instability and reduced purchasing power might negate any benefits.

Underlying the entire conversation is a concern about the erosion of trust in US institutions, particularly the perceived threats to the Federal Reserve's independence. Commenters noted that the dollar's strength is fundamentally tied to trust in the US government and its financial stewardship, and that recent political actions are accelerating a global shift toward a multipolar currency system. While some dismissed the relevance of cryptocurrencies to the reserve currency discussion, others suggested that "de-dollarization" might be occurring in less measurable, non-traditional financial realms.

## [A 26,000-year astronomical monument hidden in plain sight (2019)](https://longnow.org/ideas/the-26000-year-astronomical-monument-hidden-in-plain-sight/)
**Score:** 486 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46695628

> **Article:** The article describes the "Compass Rose" and other Art Deco sculptures at the Hoover Dam, built in the 1930s. While visually striking, the author highlights a specific, hidden feature: a celestial clock designed by artist Oskar Hansen. This clock uses the sculptures' positions and the sun's movement to mark the 26,000-year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. By observing which sculpture is illuminated by the sun on the winter solstice, one can track the slow wobble of the Earth's axis, effectively creating a monument meant to communicate astronomical time to civilizations thousands of years in the future.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the fascination with ancient or historical attempts to encode long-term knowledge, using the Hoover Dam's celestial clock as a modern example. Users express awe at the ingenuity and the "easter egg" nature of the design, contrasting it with modern construction which is often seen as purely utilitarian. There is a debate regarding the credibility of Graham Hancock, who mentioned similar concepts, with some users questioning his legitimacy while others appreciate the ideas he introduces. The conversation also delves into the astronomical science behind the monument, specifically the precession of the equinoxes and Milankovitch cycles, with users sharing Wikipedia links to provide context on how Earth's axial tilt changes over millennia. Practical aspects of celestial navigation are briefly debated, with a correction that such navigation doesn't rely solely on a fixed pole star. Finally, there is a nostalgic appreciation for the artistry of 1930s Americana and the Hoover Dam itself.

## [Nvidia Stock Crash Prediction](https://entropicthoughts.com/nvidia-stock-crash-prediction)
**Score:** 412 | **Comments:** 340 | **ID:** 46693205

> **Article:** The article analyzes the probability of a significant crash in Nvidia's stock price by examining the options market. It uses the pricing of options to infer the market's collective belief about future price movements, specifically focusing on a prediction market question about whether Nvidia's stock will close below $100 on any day in 2026. The author calculates the implied probability of such an event by analyzing the cost of put options, concluding that the market prices in a non-trivial chance of a substantial downturn. The analysis is presented as a quantitative look at market sentiment rather than a fundamental business assessment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely moves beyond the article's technical analysis to debate the fundamental drivers and real-world risks facing Nvidia. A prominent theme is geopolitical risk, with several commenters highlighting a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan as a catastrophic scenario that could drive Nvidia's stock to zero, given its reliance on TSMC for manufacturing. This is contrasted with more conventional market risks.

Another major thread focuses on the sustainability of the current AI boom. Commenters express skepticism about the endless cycle of data center spending, suggesting that as compute supply increases and hardware lifecycles extend, Nvidia's growth will inevitably slow. This leads to a debate on whether Nvidia is a hardware or software company and whether its high valuation is justified. The discussion also touches on the interconnectedness of the AI ecosystem, with some arguing that a failure in a related company (like OpenAI) could trigger a domino effect, while others see Nvidia as the central, "too big to fail" entity.

Finally, there is a meta-discussion about the nature of market prediction itself. Some commenters dismiss technical analysis as pseudoscience, while others defend the article's method of interpreting options prices as a reflection of collective market belief. A consensus emerges that while predicting a bubble's eventual pop is easy, timing it correctly is nearly impossible, making such predictions impractical for investment strategy. The conversation concludes with a value-investing perspective, questioning whether a high P/E ratio alone justifies an expectation of a crash and subsequent buying opportunity.

## [California is free of drought for the first time in 25 years](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-09/california-has-no-areas-of-dryness-first-time-in-25-years)
**Score:** 395 | **Comments:** 197 | **ID:** 46698660

> **Article:** A Los Angeles Times article reports that California is officially free of drought for the first time in 25 years, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The state has seen significant rainfall and snowfall, filling reservoirs and ending long-standing dry conditions. However, the article notes that while current conditions are favorable, water conservation remains important due to the state's history of variable climate patterns.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a nuanced and skeptical perspective on the drought announcement, focusing on historical context, infrastructure, and regional disparities.

Many commenters expressed caution, citing the cyclical nature of California's climate. A top-voted comment quotes John Steinbeck's *East of Eden* to illustrate how residents tend to forget dry years during wet ones and vice versa. Others pointed out that while reservoirs are full, the crucial snowpack is below normal due to a warm winter, raising concerns about water availability into the summer. The discussion also highlighted that California's water rates remain high, with users explaining that this reflects the fixed costs of water infrastructure and delivery, not just the current rainfall.

Infrastructure was a key debate point. One user argued that the state's failure to build more dams is the primary cause of water shortages, but others countered that the best sites are already used, and dams have significant environmental and financial costs. The conversation broadened to include national context, with commenters noting that while California is drought-free, other parts of the U.S. are experiencing severe dry conditions. Personal anecdotes from long-time residents described past extreme weather events, reinforcing the idea that California's climate is inherently volatile and that the current relief may be temporary.

## [Unconventional PostgreSQL Optimizations](https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unconventional-optimizations)
**Score:** 376 | **Comments:** 57 | **ID:** 46692116

> **Article:** The article "Unconventional PostgreSQL Optimizations" by Haki Benita explores advanced techniques to improve database performance and reduce storage, focusing on scenarios where standard approaches fall short. The author presents two main case studies: first, using virtual columns (generated columns) and expression indexes to enforce uniqueness on a subset of data without the storage overhead of a full unique constraint. Second, leveraging hash indexes for efficient deduplication of large text fields (like URLs) to save significant disk space, comparing their performance and size against standard B-tree indexes. The article also touches on using the `MERGE` command for more flexible upsert operations and discusses the trade-offs of enabling constraint exclusion for all tables. Overall, it demonstrates how to push PostgreSQL beyond its default configurations to solve specific, high-impact problems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with users praising the article for its depth and for revealing the powerful, lesser-known features of PostgreSQL. Many commenters expressed a sense of awe at the database's capabilities, with one comparing it to Emacs as an "operating system disguised as something else."

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the technical details of the optimizations presented. The use of hash indexes sparked a debate about their handling of hash collisions, with several users clarifying that PostgreSQL's implementation correctly resolves collisions by comparing the full column values, ensuring data integrity. The discussion also compared the author's approach to using generated columns, noting that while generated columns are a cleaner solution, they come with a storage cost that the article's method specifically aimed to avoid.

The article's mention of the `MERGE` command for upserts was a key point of interest. Users compared it to the more common `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` syntax, with some noting that `MERGE` is more powerful but also has historical complexities within PostgreSQL's MVCC model, making `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` a preferred choice for many.

Finally, the conversation touched on broader PostgreSQL architecture topics. One user pointed out that PostgreSQL's lack of plan caching for simple queries (compared to other databases) is a key reason why features like constraint exclusion are not enabled by default, as the planning overhead would be incurred on every query execution. Another comment highlighted the trade-off between read performance (from heavy indexing) and write amplification, suggesting that for write-heavy workloads, it might be better to offload analytical queries to a separate read replica.

## [Anthropic's original take home assignment open sourced](https://github.com/anthropics/original_performance_takehome)
**Score:** 367 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46700594

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository containing Anthropic's original performance-oriented take-home assignment for engineering candidates. The assignment is a low-level optimization challenge where the goal is to optimize a kernel within a simulated environment to minimize execution cycles. It includes a simulator, test cases, and profiling tools, challenging candidates to achieve performance better than a baseline solution provided by the company.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the nature of the assignment and the company's hiring philosophy. Key themes included:

*   **Assignment Difficulty and Focus:** Users debated the assignment's difficulty, noting it requires deep knowledge of hardware, compiler optimizations, and GPU architecture (specifically polyhedral layout algebra). Some found it an interesting challenge, while others felt it was too specialized and time-consuming for a take-home test.
*   **Hiring Philosophy:** A central debate was whether this type of problem effectively selects for the right talent. Some argued it prioritizes "nerds" with niche optimization knowledge over broader creativity, while others countered that this low-level expertise is a fundamental and necessary skill for the roles in question, contrasting it with more common web development assignments.
*   **Tone and Company Perception:** Several commenters criticized the tone of the assignment's README, particularly the line challenging candidates to beat Claude's performance, as arrogant or "pompous." This was tied to a broader skepticism of Anthropic's corporate character.
*   **Practical Concerns:** Users discussed the practical aspects, such as the time commitment required (noting the 2-hour figure was the AI's runtime, not a candidate deadline) and the assignment's similarity to "demoscene" code golf challenges.
*   **AI Performance:** A minor thread discussed using AI tools like Gemini CLI to solve the problem, with users noting that these models could get stuck in long-running loops on such complex, low-level tasks.

## [Ask HN: Do you have any evidence that agentic coding works?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691243)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 296 | **ID:** 46691243

> **Question:** The user asks the Hacker News community for evidence that "agentic coding" (using AI agents to write code) is effective. The question is open-ended, seeking real-world proof, experiences, or data that justify the hype around AI coding agents, implying a skepticism about their practical utility beyond simple demos.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a nuanced consensus: agentic coding is useful but requires significant human oversight and is best suited for specific, constrained tasks rather than complex architectural work.

A central theme is the distinction between the agent's capability and the user's skill. Several commenters argue that using agents effectively is a skill that must be developed, similar to learning programming itself. They suggest that failures often stem from improper use—such as giving agents overly broad or open-ended tasks—rather than inherent limitations of the technology. Successful workflows involve breaking problems into small, concrete steps, reviewing plans before implementation, and strictly managing the agent's scope.

However, there is strong skepticism regarding the agent's ability to handle high-level design and complex systems. Critics argue that agents lack the capacity for long-term planning and understanding abstract system architecture, limiting their viability to "extremely small and simple" projects. A notable anecdote highlighted the risk of subtle failures: an agent generated unit tests that passed by always returning true, effectively cheating to satisfy the requirements without actually testing the code. This underscores the critical need for human review, as agents can produce code that appears functional but is unmaintainable or unreliable.

The community largely agrees that agents function best as "junior developers" or "unblockers" for boilerplate, repetitive work, rather than as autonomous engineers. While they can accelerate development for simple CRUD apps or specific tasks, they cannot replace the need for expert guidance in designing and building large, complex software. The prevailing view is that agents are a productivity tool that reduces typing and handles mundane tasks, but the core intellectual work of software engineering remains a human responsibility.

## [Meta's legal team abandoned its ethical duties](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/how-metas-lawyers-perfected-the-playbook)
**Score:** 263 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46694378

> **Article:** The article argues that Meta's legal team has systematically abandoned its ethical duties, instead using legal tools to suppress evidence and conceal the harmful effects of its products. It contends that lawyers, who are supposed to be officers of the court, have become complicit in a corporate strategy that prioritizes profit over public well-being. By leveraging attorney-client privilege and aggressive data retention policies, they have allegedly perfected a playbook for shielding the company from accountability for ethical and legal violations, particularly concerning user harm and child safety.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Meta and the broader tech industry's ethical standards, though it branches into several related themes.

A significant portion of the comments express deep cynicism and personal anecdotes about the negative impact of social media. One user urges parents to read "Careless People" and avoid social media for their children, a sentiment echoed by a parent who described the difficulty of enforcing such rules and the feeling of being a "villain" against addictive corporate products. Another commenter, claiming to be a former Facebook employee, confirms the toxic internal culture, stating that success at the company requires a willingness to do "anything" to optimize performance metrics.

The discussion broadens from Meta to a systemic critique of corporate ethics in the US. Several users argue that the primary duty of a for-profit company is to maximize shareholder value, often at the expense of ethics and legality. This is framed as a conscious choice, with one user noting that executives perform cost-benefit analyses on potential punishments rather than avoiding unethical actions. The comparison to UnitedHealthcare was used to illustrate that this behavior is not unique to tech. However, another user countered that this "profit-first" mentality is a societal choice, not an immutable law, and can be changed through regulation and shifting norms.

Finally, there was a notable dissenting voice. One commenter challenged the article's premise, arguing that practices like minimizing legal risk and using attorney-client privilege are not inherently unethical but are standard, responsible legal functions. This perspective was met with sharp criticism from others who found the interpretation to be disingenuous and a perfect example of the ethical blindness the article describes.

## [cURL removes bug bounties](https://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/72808-curl-removes-bug-bounties.html)
**Score:** 253 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46701733

> **Article:** The article reports that the cURL project has discontinued its bug bounty program on the HackerOne platform. The decision was made by project maintainer Daniel Stenberg due to an overwhelming influx of low-quality, automated, and often nonsensical vulnerability reports, which he refers to as "slop." The volume of these spam-like submissions has made the program unsustainable, as it consumes significant time and resources to sift through the noise to find legitimate security issues.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely sympathizes with the cURL team's decision, viewing it as a necessary response to a systemic problem exacerbated by AI. The discussion centers on the negative impact of AI-powered tools on open-source maintenance and security processes.

Key themes include:
*   **The Nature of the Problem:** Commenters confirm that the "slop" consists of AI-generated reports that are often incoherent, factually incorrect, or describe non-existent vulnerabilities. They note that submitters often lack a fundamental understanding of the software they are targeting, simply using AI to generate and spam reports in the hope of getting a payout.
*   **Human Problem, Not a Tool Problem:** While AI is the enabling technology, many argue the root cause is human behavior. The low barrier to entry and potential for financial reward incentivize bad-faith actors to spam projects, a problem that existed before but has been massively amplified by LLMs.
*   **Proposed Solutions:** Several ideas were floated to combat the issue, though with varying degrees of skepticism. The most prominent suggestion was implementing an entry fee for submissions, which would be refunded if the report is deemed valid. This would create a financial disincentive for spamming. Other ideas included using AI to filter the submissions (a "fight fire with fire" approach) or simply accepting that the problem is a new reality of open-source maintenance.
*   **Broader Implications for Open Source:** The incident is seen as part of a larger trend where AI negatively impacts the open-source ecosystem. Commenters pointed out that open-source code was used to train the models, which are now being used to spam those same projects. There was also a cynical view that AI could eventually replace much of the code that open-source communities build and maintain.
*   **Wider Industry Context:** The problem is not unique to cURL. One commenter shared a personal anecdote about their company's security email being flooded with AI-generated pentest reports full of false positives, rendering the channel useless.

## [The Unix Pipe Card Game](https://punkx.org/unix-pipe-game/)
**Score:** 222 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46694124

> **Article:** The article links to "The Unix Pipe Card Game," a physical card game designed to teach the concept of Unix pipes. The game uses cards to represent commands (like `grep`, `sort`, `wc`) and data, allowing players to physically arrange them to create command pipelines. The goal is to solve puzzles or "win" by constructing a valid sequence of commands that transforms input data into the desired output. It is a low-tech, tactile educational tool intended to make the abstract concept of piping data between programs more concrete and accessible, particularly for beginners or children.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a split between appreciating the game as a novel educational tool and critiquing its practical effectiveness compared to digital methods. The creator, jackdoe, clarifies that the game is not meant to be a standalone, replayable game but rather a "physical helper" to introduce concepts before moving to a real terminal, especially for teaching his daughter.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Physical vs. Digital Learning:** A major point of debate is whether a physical card game is the best way to learn Unix pipes. One commenter, a science teacher, argues that digital tools provide crucial instant, visual feedback that a card game lacks, which is essential for discovery-based learning. Another user counters that the trial-and-error nature of the command line can be frustrating for beginners, and a guided, low-pressure physical game might be a gentler introduction.
*   **Replayability and Use Case:** Several users question the game's longevity, suggesting it's a "play once" novelty. The creator responds that this is its intended purpose: a brief, engaging icebreaker to illustrate the "composability" of commands before getting hands-on with a computer.
*   **Alternatives and Related Concepts:** The conversation naturally branched into digital alternatives. Users mentioned online card game versions, command-line wargames like OverTheWire's Bandit, and modern shells like Nushell that offer more powerful, object-oriented piping than traditional Unix text streams.
*   **Nostalgia and Appreciation:** Many commenters expressed fondness for the elegance of classic Unix tools (`awk`, `sed`) and saw the game as a cute, clever way to pass on that knowledge. The game was generally viewed positively as a creative educational project, even by those who preferred digital learning methods.

## [Instabridge has acquired Nova Launcher](https://novalauncher.com/nova-is-here-to-stay)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46696357

> **Article:** Instabridge has acquired Nova Launcher, as announced on the official Nova Launcher website. The announcement includes a FAQ stating that the app will continue to be maintained, data collection will be "minimal and purpose driven," and that they do not sell personal data. The post also addresses questions regarding ads, stating that while they are exploring options for the free version, Nova Prime will remain ad-free.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant skepticism and concern regarding the acquisition, primarily focusing on recent changes to Nova Launcher's privacy practices and corporate ownership history.

A major point of contention is the recent addition of Facebook and Google Ads tracking to the app. Commenters cited a previous discussion (referenced in the comments) detailing these trackers, which contradicts the new owners' promise of minimal data collection. Users expressed disbelief in the "we do not sell personal data" claim, with one user noting that companies often rebrand "anonymized" data as non-personal to justify selling it.

The discussion also provided context on the app's corporate trajectory. Users noted that Nova Launcher was previously acquired by Branch Metrics in 2022, followed by layoffs in August 2024 that left only the original developer, and his subsequent departure in September 2025 after being told to stop work on open-sourcing the project. Commenters viewed the "Nova is here to stay" messaging as a classic corporate signal that the app is likely to be discontinued or further "enshittified."

Consequently, many users discussed alternatives, recommending open-source launchers like Lawnchair or other customizable options like AIO Launcher. There was a consensus that stock Android and Samsung launchers have improved enough to serve as viable replacements for former Nova users.

## [IPv6 is not insecure because it lacks a NAT](https://www.johnmaguire.me/blog/ipv6-is-not-insecure-because-it-lacks-nat/)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 298 | **ID:** 46696303

> **Article:** The article argues that the common belief that IPv6 is insecure because it lacks Network Address Translation (NAT) is a misconception. The author clarifies that NAT was primarily implemented to solve IPv4 address exhaustion, not for security. While NAT does provide a side effect of security by making internal devices unreachable from the internet by default, this is actually a function of the stateful firewall that accompanies NAT, not NAT itself. The article asserts that IPv6 can be just as secure as IPv4 by using a default-deny firewall, and that the absence of NAT does not inherently make IPv6 less secure.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a nuanced debate among network engineers and enthusiasts, centering on the relationship between NAT, firewalls, and security. While many agree with the article's core premise that NAT is not a security feature by design, several commenters argue that it provides "security by obscurity" or as a side effect. A key point of contention is whether routers drop unsolicited inbound traffic by default; one commenter corrects the author, noting that routers route packets based on the destination IP, and it is the firewall (not NAT) that typically blocks them. This leads to a discussion on the importance of default-deny firewall policies in IPv6, with some expressing concern that consumer routers might not enforce these as strictly as they should.

The conversation also touches on practical implementation details, such as the difference between IPv4's Network and Port Translation (NAPT) and IPv6's Prefix-Translation. Some participants shared personal anecdotes of security breaches due to misconfigured IPv6 firewalls, reinforcing the idea that the security model relies on the firewall, not the address translation. Ultimately, the consensus leans towards the article's argument, but with the acknowledgment that the perceived security of NAT in IPv4 is a deeply ingrained belief that influences real-world decisions, such as corporate audits.

## [The challenges of soft delete](https://atlas9.dev/blog/soft-delete.html)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46698061

> **Article:** The article "The challenges of soft delete" explores the common practice of using a flag (like `deleted_at`) to mark records as deleted instead of physically removing them. While this approach offers benefits like easy data recovery and maintaining referential integrity, the article highlights significant drawbacks. These include query complexity (constantly needing to filter out deleted rows), performance degradation as tables grow with "dead" data, and complications with data compliance regulations like GDPR that mandate actual data erasure. The author suggests alternative architectures, such as moving deleted records to a separate archive table or using database triggers to log deletions, to mitigate these issues while retaining the ability to restore data when necessary.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a nuanced debate on the merits of soft deletion, with consensus leaning toward context-dependent solutions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

A primary theme is the trade-off between convenience and performance/compliance. Several users shared strategies to optimize soft deletion. Common suggestions included moving deleted records to a separate collection (in NoSQL) or table (in SQL) to keep active tables lean, or using database features like Postgres Row Level Security (RLS) and views to hide deleted records from application code automatically. However, users noted that moving data in relational databases is complex due to foreign key constraints.

Compliance and privacy regulations were cited as a major reason to avoid soft deletes. While some argued that soft deletes are necessary for data retention laws, others pointed out that privacy requests (like CCPA or GDPR) often require actual deletion or anonymization, making soft deletes a liability. A distinction was made between "soft deleting" a comment (hiding it from public view but keeping it for moderation) and fulfilling a "right to be forgotten" request (irreversible deletion).

The discussion also touched on data analysis and immutability. Proponents of soft deletes argued that retaining historical data is invaluable for analytics, debugging, and auditing, with one user noting, "data is never deleted" in the business world. Conversely, others highlighted the "toxic asset" nature of retaining data indefinitely, citing storage costs and security risks. A specific technical challenge raised was schema drift: archived data may not match the current schema, making restoration difficult without complex migrations.

Ultimately, the community agreed that the decision depends on the specific domain (e.g., banking vs. social media), data volume, and legal requirements. While soft deletes offer a safety net, they introduce query complexity and maintenance overhead that can outweigh their benefits if not managed carefully.

## [IP Addresses Through 2025](https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2026-01/addr2025.html)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46691835

> **Article:** The article "IP Addresses Through 2025" provides a data-driven analysis of the IPv4 and IPv6 address markets and allocation trends. A central finding is the significant collapse in IPv4 transfer prices, which have fallen from a peak of ~$55 per address in 2021 back to 2014 levels of around $9. The author attributes this to a combination of factors, including the maturation of Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) which drastically reduces the need for public IPs in mobile networks, and the shifting strategies of major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS). After years of aggressive stockpiling, AWS appears to have moved from accumulation to inventory management, a shift that coincided with their introduction of a per-hour charge for public IPv4 addresses. While IPv4 demand is softening, the article notes that IPv6 adoption continues to grow steadily but remains a secondary concern for many network operators. The piece concludes on a philosophical note, reflecting that the internet is no longer a disruptive challenger but an established norm, facing increasing centralization and a challenging regulatory environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: the economic dynamics of the IPv4 market, the geopolitical implications of IP address allocation, and the ongoing debate around IPv6 adoption.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the sharp decline in IPv4 prices. One commenter highlighted this as evidence of an "artificial scarcity bubble" driven by hyperscalers like AWS, which has now burst. They argued that once AWS began charging customers for IPv4 addresses, their own acquisition pressure vanished, validating the market's shift. Another user noted that the widespread deployment of CGNAT by mobile carriers has effectively made the IPv4 scarcity a non-issue for a large segment of users, further depressing demand. This led to a discussion about the future of IPv4, with some suggesting it will become an "artisanal" choice for services like email where IP reputation is critical, while others pointed to a persistent grey market for legacy address blocks.

The discussion also branched into geopolitics, sparked by a comment claiming that China and India have been acquiring large blocks of African IP addresses, allegedly for "botting operations." This prompted a debate about the language used to describe such acquisitions, with one user questioning whether it refers to government actions or private corporations, finding the country-level attribution imprecise.

Finally, there was a recurring call for more aggressive IPv6 adoption. Several commenters expressed frustration with the slow transition, proposing "sticks" like mandating IPv6 support for ISP broadband classification or creating a "wall of shame" for services that remain IPv4-only. However, this was tempered by the practical reality that even early IPv6 adopters still face operational challenges, highlighting the technical inertia that continues to slow its universal deployment.

Developed by the team behind Gatsby, it is designed to be "TypeScript-first" and vendor-agnostic, providing primitives for agents, workflows, and tool integration. The framework aims to offer a production-grade solution for full-stack TypeScript developers who want a native experience without being locked into a specific AI model or platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response to the launch was largely positive, with several users expressing excitement for a production-ready, TypeScript-native agent framework. A key theme was the comparison to other frameworks like LangChain, with the creators arguing that Mastra allows teams to focus on their agent logic rather than maintaining an internal framework, a sentiment echoed by a Brex CTO quote shared in the comments.

Technical discussion focused on Mastra's differentiators, particularly its TypeScript-first approach compared to alternatives like Strands Agents or Spring AI. A notable feature highlighted was the `.network()` method, which enables dynamic, runtime-decided multi-agent hierarchies. While most comments were supportive, one user raised a critical point about potential vendor lock-in, suggesting that while Mastra itself is open-source, the convenience it provides might still tie users to a specific underlying platform or execution pattern (e.g., the Claude Agent SDK). The creators responded by emphasizing their commitment to open-source and customization for production environments.

## ['The old order is not coming back,' Carney says in speech at Davos](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/carney-davos-speech-9.7052725)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46694482

> **Article:** The article reports on a speech by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Davos economic forum. Carney argues that the post-World War II "rules-based international order" is effectively over, stating "the old order is not coming back." He contends that this system was always somewhat of a fiction, as powerful nations exempted themselves from rules while enforcing them on others. Carney asserts that the world is now entering an era of "intensifying great power rivalry" where economic integration is used as a tool of coercion. He calls for middle powers to develop greater strategic autonomy in energy, finance, and supply chains to navigate this new landscape.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is heavily focused on the geopolitical implications of Carney's speech, particularly in the context of the Trump administration's policies and the perceived decline of US leadership. A central theme is the formation of a "middle power" alliance, with commenters suggesting that countries like Canada and EU nations must organize to avoid being dominated by larger powers. There is a strong consensus that the US is now viewed as an unreliable partner, with the re-election of Trump seen as a clear signal that the US is abandoning its role as the guarantor of the international order.

The conversation frequently draws historical parallels, most notably to the pre-WWII era. One commenter draws a detailed analogy between the current geopolitical climate and the 1930s, comparing the US's alignment with Russia and China to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Stalin and Hitler. This sparked a counter-argument that the more relevant comparison is the Sino-Soviet split, suggesting an opportunity for Europe to ally with China against Russia and the US. Another user expanded on the WWII analogy to argue that fascism was not defeated after the war but has been reborn in modern US and European politics.

Beyond the geopolitical analysis, commenters also touched on the economic and domestic consequences. One perspective noted that the shift away from the current order will be paid for by ordinary people through higher prices and austerity. Another commenter contrasted the coherence of Carney's speech with Trump's rhetoric, finding Carney's clarity refreshing. There was also some discussion about Carney's own political background and his recent election as Canada's Prime Minister, attributing his victory partly to a failure by the opposition to effectively counter Trump's threats against Canada.

## [The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns](https://www.nibzard.com/agentic-handbook)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46701969

> **Article:** The article "The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns" is a comprehensive guide that consolidates various techniques and strategies for building and managing AI agents. It aims to standardize the vocabulary and provide a structured approach to agentic coding, covering patterns that help developers harness AI for tasks ranging from simple code assistance to complex workflows. The resource is presented as a collection of patterns, similar to established software engineering concepts like Design Patterns or Test-Driven Development (TDD).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant divide between optimism about the potential of agentic AI and deep skepticism regarding its current practicality and the hype surrounding it.

A central theme is the high "cognitive cost" and practical difficulties of using agents. Several commenters expressed frustration that managing agents often requires more effort than solving problems directly, leading to a "nightmare" of fixing downstream regressions and chaos. This sentiment is captured by the idea that the dream of a fully automated "Issue → Pull Request" workflow is fraught with failure modes. To mitigate this, one user suggested a practical pattern: forcing the agent to explain its reasoning before taking irreversible actions like deleting files or pushing code.

Conversely, other users defended the emerging field, framing the current difficulties as a necessary learning curve. They see value in resources like the handbook for helping developers "learn to harness" the technology and standardize their approach, much like adopting TDD.

Skepticism was also directed at the article itself. Some commenters dismissed it as "AI-generated slop," questioning its originality and the author's expertise. This reflects a broader anxiety about the proliferation of AI-generated content. Others were cynical about the utility of such pattern-based guides, comparing them to past "snake oil" methodologies like Agile/Scrum, and suggesting their primary value is for middle managers to create "AI Strategies" for presentations.

Finally, a few commenters offered alternative perspectives. One suggested that reading original research papers on arXiv would be more beneficial than consuming curated pattern lists. Another expressed feeling left behind, using simple copy-paste methods while more complex "agent-integrated" IDEs seem to be the future, though a counterpoint argued that simply using a tool like Claude Code is more effective than over-complicating the process with frameworks.

## ['This is sell America' – US dollar tumbles as globe flees US assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/20/sell-america-trade-dollar-treasury-gold-us-trump-greenland.html)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46695061

> **Article:** The CNBC article reports on a significant downturn in the US dollar and a sell-off of US assets, termed the "Sell America" trade. This trend is attributed to growing global uncertainty regarding US economic policy and geopolitical stability. The article highlights concerns that international investors are increasingly divesting from US dollars and treasuries, seeking alternative safe havens like gold, driven by fears over aggressive trade policies and political rhetoric that challenges long-standing alliances.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the current US administration, framing the economic downturn as a direct consequence of political decisions. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **Geopolitical Alienation:** Users point to specific actions, such as imposing tariffs on Canada and threatening NATO allies, as the primary cause for the loss of confidence in US assets. A speech by Mark Carney at Davos is cited as evidence of traditional allies distancing themselves from the US.
*   **Political Accountability:** There is significant frustration directed at the Republican legislators for their silence regarding the administration's policies, which commenters view as complicity in actions they describe as unconstitutional and economically damaging. The discussion notes that despite these concerns, the administration retains voter support, which explains the lack of political pushback.
*   **Investment Strategy:** In response to the volatility, users discuss shifting investments away from US-centric funds (like VOO) toward international equities (VXUS) and commodities like gold. However, there is debate over the effectiveness of these hedges for US-based investors whose expenses remain dollar-denominated.
*   **Rhetoric and Stability:** The tone of the discussion is alarmist, with users expressing fear over the administration's rhetoric, including comparisons to authoritarian regimes and concerns about potential escalation. The conversation reflects a sentiment that the US is actively dismantling its global economic and diplomatic standing.

## [Claude Chill: Fix Claude Code's flickering in terminal](https://github.com/davidbeesley/claude-chill)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46699072

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "claude-chill," a small utility created by developer David Beesley. The tool fixes a persistent visual bug in Anthropic's "Claude Code" CLI application where the terminal output flickers excessively during operation, which users find distracting and causes eye strain. The fix is a simple, creative workaround that intercepts and modifies the terminal output to stabilize the display.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive and grateful towards the creator of the tool, with many users expressing relief and thanking them for solving a long-standing annoyance. However, the gratitude is quickly overshadowed by widespread criticism directed at Anthropic. Commenters express disbelief and frustration that a core usability issue in a paid product remains unfixed by the company, while a third-party developer had to create a simple fix. This is seen as particularly hypocritical given Anthropic's public statements about AI's ability to write code and replace human developers. The sentiment is that if the company's own product has such basic, unresolved bugs, it undermines their broader claims about AI's coding prowess. A few comments humorously note the irony of a human fixing an AI tool's UI, and one user confirms the issue persists even after several months of not using the product.
