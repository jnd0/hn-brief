The UK government's move to force encryption backdoors under the Online Safety Act is a masterclass in authoritarian doublespeak, framing mass surveillance as "safety" while ignoring the fundamental reality that you cannot selectively break encryption for "good guys" without handing keys to every bad actor. This follows the revelation that journalists poorly redacted Snowden PDFs, leaving sensitive data hidden in metadata layers—a stark reminder that digital footprints are forever, and governments excel at exploiting both technical loopholes and public fear. The hypocrisy is palpable: while demanding backdoors, UK agencies can’t even secure their own systems, as shown by the exemption of central government departments from their own cyber laws—a loophole so blatant it screams "rules for thee, not for me."  

Meanwhile, the tech world remains locked in its eternal OS war, with Windows 11 now widely derided as the "slowest Windows in 25 years" due to bloatware and telemetry. This has ironically fueled a resurgence in Linux adoption, as users fleeing Microsoft's ad-infested, resource-hungry mess find solace in distributions like Bazzite, where gaming via Proton works shockingly well. It’s a cycle as old as time: corporate overreach breeds grassroots rebellion. The same dynamic plays out in app ecosystems, where Dark Sky’s elegant, hyperlocal weather predictions remain unmatched years after Apple’s acquisition and shutdown—a cautionary tale of how Big Tech swallows innovation only to let it wither.  

Developer tooling, at least, sees pragmatic progress. Ghostty’s terminal team squashed a memory leak by embracing simplicity over cleverness, proving that sometimes the best fix is the one that doesn’t overcomplicate. Rust-based projects like Ferrite, a Markdown editor with native Mermaid rendering, are winning fans by rejecting web-tech bloat in favor of native performance. Yet even here, old debates resurface: Org mode advocates argue its syntax is objectively superior to Markdown’s ubiquity, but practicality wins—Markdown’s network effect is the road everyone drives on, regardless of which side is "correct."  

AI’s role in this chaos is stress-testing business models and sanity alike. The "Open Chaos" experiment, where features merge based on community votes, feels like Twitch Plays Pokémon for code—amusing but likely to spawn a monster. Elsewhere, AI-generated book connections showcase LLMs’ knack for finding patterns, even if they lean toward conspiracy themes, while the "business model stress test" thesis argues that AI commoditizes coding, forcing tools like Tailwind to pivot from convenience to irreplaceable value.  

Institutional distrust runs deep: private equity’s strip-mining of autism centers mirrors skepticism around Canada’s "mystery brain disease," where government denial clashes with patient advocacy and whispers of Irving family influence. Both cases highlight how power structures prioritize optics over people.  

On the lighter side, drones now recharge on power lines—a clever hack for infrastructure inspection, though one can’t help but wonder about the "Birds Aren’t Real" crowd’s take. And in space, NASA’s unplanned astronaut return underscores that even orbital missions aren’t immune to earthly frailties.  

Finally, we bid farewell to Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir, whose legacy extends beyond music to his lyricist John Perry Barlow’s Electronic Frontier Foundation—a reminder that counterculture once fought for digital freedom, not against it.  

**Worth watching**: The UK’s encryption battle will be a bellwether for global privacy. If backdoors become law, expect tech giants to either withdraw services or create UK-specific, less secure versions—and for the privacy-conscious to flee to encrypted apps en masse.
