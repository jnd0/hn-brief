The death of Scott Adams at 68 from prostate cancer sparked a Hacker News eulogy that was equal parts nostalgia and revisionism. Longtime users praised *Dilbert* as a timeless dissection of corporate absurdity, with many separating the artist from his later controversies—though the thread also became a grim marketplace discussion, noting how Boomer-era cultural artifacts will soon flood secondary markets as Gen Z remains oblivious. The swiftness of Adams' decline, from diagnosis to paralysis in months, served as a stark reminder of mortality, capped by the community's unanimous verdict: "Fuck cancer."  

Meanwhile, Bandcamp drew a line in the sand, banning AI-generated music to preserve its identity as a sanctuary for human artistry. The decision was cheered by users fatigued by "AI slop" flooding platforms like Spotify, though a pragmatic minority argued for nuance—questioning whether AI-assisted production (like drum programming) should be treated differently from fully automated generation. This tension between purism and pragmatism underscores a broader struggle: as AI commoditizes creation, platforms must choose between efficiency and authenticity.  

Apple’s new $12.99/month "Creator Studio" bundle—grouping Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and others—was met with predictable cynicism. While the educational discount ($2.99/month) drew praise, users noted most only need one or two apps, making the bundle a tough sell. The real subtext? Frustration with Apple’s "dual nature" approach to iPadOS, where it’s simultaneously a walled garden and a supposed Mac replacement. Adobe’s shadow loomed large, with many seeing this as a belated attempt to challenge Creative Cloud’s hegemony.  

In open-source news, Chromium’s reversal on JPEG XL—now enabled by default via a Rust implementation—was hailed as a win for web performance. The pivot quashed earlier security concerns about C++ libraries, positioning JPEG XL as a potential JPEG/PNG killer. Yet adoption remains the elephant in the room: without universal support, developers hesitate, perpetuating the chicken-and-egg stalemate that plagues new standards.  

The AI security debate intensified as Signal’s leadership warned that "agentic AI" is an insecure surveillance nightmare. Skeptics questioned Signal’s motives (was this a stealth play for their own AI product?), but most agreed: giving AI broad data access creates an unmanageable attack surface. The root issue? OS security models haven’t evolved to handle untrusted code, and sandboxing is a band-aid. The only real solution: keep sensitive data off third-party models entirely.  

On the geopolitical front, two stories revealed how information is weaponized. First, a network of pro-Iranian X accounts posing as Scottish nationalists went dark during Iran’s internet blackout, exposing how disinformation campaigns exploit authentic debates to sow division. Second, Iran’s 118-hour national internet shutdown—a deliberate silencing of 90 million people—highlighted the state’s ability to erase a nation from the digital world. Both cases underscored the fragility of online truth and the ease of manipulating international audiences.  

The erosion of local journalism also drew scrutiny, with users lamenting how the collapse of ad-supported models has left communities without watchdogs. Proposed solutions ranged from public funding (a risky bet for independence) to Patreon-style grassroots models. The consensus: without local reporting, democracy loses its eyes and ears, yet the remaining outlets are often timid or hollowed out by conglomerates.  

Finally, the push for digital self-reliance gained traction. A project to self-host Reddit’s 2.38 billion posts offline was praised for preserving knowledge but debated for its ethics—should authors’ deletion rights trump community access? Meanwhile, a call to open-source software for end-of-life hardware (like Spotify’s dead Car Thing) hit a wall: security models prevent it, and companies won’t cannibalize sales. The DIY spirit shone brighter in projects like the Tulip Creative Computer—a minimalist ESP32-based device for coding/art, and a solar-battery analysis showing a 6-year payoff for a £22k system.  

**Worth watching**: How platforms like Bandcamp and Apple navigate the AI gold rush—will they prioritize human craft or chase efficiency? And as state-sponsored disinformation and internet blackouts escalate, expect more battles over who controls the digital narrative.
