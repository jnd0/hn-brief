The Chromium project has finally merged JPEG XL support, a move that feels less like a technical decision and more like a quiet admission that the web's image format wars were being fought on the wrong battlefield. After years of Google pushing AVIF and WebP, the community-driven Rust implementation of JXL appears to have overcome the security objections that led to its initial rejection. For developers, this is a rare win against the tide of corporate consolidation; JXL’s Pareto-optimal blend of speed, compression, and features like progressive decoding and HDR makes it a genuinely superior successor to the legacy formats we’re still shackled to. It’s a reminder that sometimes, persistent, evidence-based argument can still sway the maintainers of the world’s most important rendering engine.

This victory for open standards stands in stark contrast to the broader, more cynical trend of platform enclosure and rent-seeking. Apple’s new “Creator Studio” bundle is a masterclass in this, repackaging existing professional apps into a subscription model that feels inevitable, if not particularly inspired. While the one-time purchase options remain, the move signals a clear direction: the ecosystem is shifting from ownership to access, and Apple wants its cut. The pricing is competitive, especially with the educational discount, but the real story is the continued identity crisis of the iPad, which remains a content consumption device because Apple’s own policies prevent it from becoming a true development platform. The lack of “XCode for iPadOS” isn’t an oversight; it’s a strategic choice to keep the walled garden tidy.

Meanwhile, the open web is being actively cannibalized by the very AI companies it’s enabling. The MetaBrainz story is a perfect, depressing microcosm: a volunteer-run, open-data project is being DDoSed into locking down its APIs by aggressive scrapers, a “tragedy of the commons” where AI firms externalize their data acquisition costs onto the rest of us. This isn’t just about server bills; it’s about the slow death of the open, accessible web. We’re moving from a world of public APIs and data dumps to one of authentication tokens and rate limits, all because a few well-funded entities can’t be bothered to be good citizens. The same dynamic is playing out in the debate over Bandcamp’s ban on AI-generated music, which is less about anti-AI sentiment and more about drawing a line against the platform-destroying “slop” that threatens to drown out human creators.

The security implications of this AI gold rush are becoming impossible to ignore. Signal’s warning about agentic AI is a stark reminder that we’re building systems with an “infinite attack surface” and calling it progress. The core issue isn’t the AI itself, but the fact that our operating systems and security models were never designed for this. We’re piping all our data through systems we don’t fully understand or control, and the race to the bottom is already underway. This isn’t a theoretical risk; it’s the same carelessness that led to the current state of web scraping, where efficiency and collaboration are ignored in favor of brute-force data extraction.

This pattern of prioritizing growth over stability is creating a more fragile, more controlled world. The UK’s drift towards “precrime” and dissent management, as detailed in the 2025 analysis, reads like a policy wishlist for authoritarian regimes everywhere. Combine that with the deliberate internet blackouts in Iran, which are becoming a standard tool for silencing dissent, and you see a clear playbook: control the infrastructure, control the narrative. It’s a grim picture, and the fact that disinformation networks like the one exposed in Scotland are now a standard geopolitical tool just adds another layer of noise and distrust to an already degraded information ecosystem.

Even in the midst of this, there are pockets of pragmatic resilience. The community’s response to the death of Scott Adams was a case study in separating the art from the artist, choosing to remember the cultural impact of *Dilbert* while acknowledging the controversies of his later years. It was a mature, if somber, reflection on legacy. On a more practical note, the project to self-host a massive Reddit archive is a direct response to the ephemerality and corporate control of modern platforms—a recognition that if you want something to last, you can’t rely on someone else’s server.

The underlying theme is a fight for control. Control over our media, our data, our hardware, and our discourse. The push to force companies to open-source software for EOL hardware is a small but important battle in that war, a stand against the planned obsolescence that turns functional devices into bricks. And the debate over LLM evangelism, with its “insecure” promotion, is really about who controls the future of creation: is it the craftsman using a tool, or the tool that’s making the craftsman obsolete?

The year ahead will be defined by these conflicts. The tension between open and closed, human and machine, control and freedom is reaching a boiling point. The winners and losers are already being decided in pull requests, platform policies, and the quiet, deliberate decisions of engineers and users alike.

**Worth watching:** The real-world fallout from the Chromium JPEG XL merge and whether it can actually gain traction against the incumbents. Also, the first signs of a serious regulatory or legal challenge to the “scrape everything” business model of major AI companies.
