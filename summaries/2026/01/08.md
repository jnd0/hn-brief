## [Project Patchouli: Open-source electromagnetic drawing tablet hardware](https://patchouli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
**Score:** 400 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46537489

> **Article:** The article introduces "Project Patchouli," an open-source electromagnetic resonance (EMR) drawing tablet. The project provides complete, publicly available hardware designs, reverse-engineering documentation, and software to build a functional drawing tablet from scratch. The core innovation is the recreation of the technology behind Wacom's EMR pens, which allows for battery-free pens with pressure and tilt sensitivity. The project serves as both a practical guide for building a tablet and a detailed technical resource for understanding how this specific hardware technology works.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with overwhelming enthusiasm for the project, praising its technical depth, documentation quality, and the creator's presentation. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Praise for the Project and Creator:** Commenters were highly impressed by the project's completeness and the high production quality of the introductory YouTube video, which demonstrates the technology and even shows a successful retrofit into a Panasonic laptop. The project's name and the use of a Touhou character theme in the video were noted and appreciated by a subset of the community.

*   **Hardware Reverse-Engineering and Patents:** The quality of the documentation, which details the reverse-engineering process, was specifically highlighted. A discussion on patents revealed that Wacom's key EMR patents have now expired, which explains the recent surge in affordable, high-quality drawing tablets and the feasibility of such an open-source project. Some speculated that this is why companies like Apple stick to more proprietary active pen technology.

*   **Learning Electronics:** The project inspired several software engineers to express interest in learning more about hardware and electrical engineering. In response, experienced members offered two distinct paths for learning:
    *   A structured approach: Studying foundational texts like "The Art of Electronics."
    *   A hands-on, exploratory approach: Disassembling and repairing broken electronics to understand how they work, designing custom PCBs, and learning through iterative practice.

*   **Documentation as a User Interface:** One thread evolved into a meta-discussion about the nature of technical documentation. A commenter argued that documentation should be treated like a user interface, prioritizing clarity and reducing cognitive load for the most confused user. This prompted a recommendation for the "Diátaxis" framework, which advocates for structuring documentation into distinct categories (tutorials, how-to guides, explanation, reference) to serve different user needs.

## [Open Infrastructure Map](https://openinframap.org)
**Score:** 364 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46536866

> **Article:** The article links to "Open Infrastructure Map" (openinframap.org), an interactive map that visualizes the world's critical infrastructure. It displays power lines (from high-voltage transmission to local distribution), substations, oil and gas pipelines, undersea cables, and telecommunication lines. The map allows users to explore the complex network of how energy is generated, transmitted, and distributed globally, revealing connections that are often invisible in daily life.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the map was largely positive, with users expressing fascination at the ability to visualize the massive scale and interconnectedness of global infrastructure, such as undersea cables and offshore wind farm connections.

However, the discussion quickly evolved into a debate about the security implications of making such data public. Several users argued that publishing the precise locations of critical infrastructure is a bad idea, making it a target for sabotage. This concern was heightened by a recent real-world event in Berlin where an electrical exchange was set on fire, with some commenters noting that the target's location was easily found in public data. Conversely, others argued that this transparency is beneficial, as it forces governments and operators to build robust systems and improves security through "security through transparency," similar to open-source software principles.

Technical and regional details were also discussed:
*   **Texas Grid:** A user questioned why the map showed Texas as interconnected, contrary to the popular belief that it operates on a completely isolated grid. The discussion clarified that while the Texas Interconnection is largely separate for political reasons, it does have some high-voltage DC ties to other grids, and the state actually contains multiple grid regions.
*   **Global Interconnection:** A user proposed a theoretical project to run power cables across the Atlantic Ocean to share solar energy between continents. The feasibility was debated, with commenters calculating the significant energy loss (around 20%) and immense material costs, though a real-world project (Nato-L) was mentioned.
*   **Data Completeness:** Users noted that the map's data varies by region. For example, the lack of infrastructure shown for Alice Springs, Australia, was attributed to it being off the main grid and the difficulty of mapping low-capacity lines, rather than a data error.

## [Tailscale state file encryption no longer enabled by default](https://tailscale.com/changelog)
**Score:** 348 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46531925

> **Article:** Tailscale has reversed a recent security change, disabling state file encryption and hardware attestation keys by default. This feature, introduced in version 1.90.2, was intended to encrypt node state files using the device's Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The rollback effectively returns the software's behavior to what it was before 1.90.2, meaning users must now manually enable the encryption flag if they want this enhanced security.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely views Tailscale's decision as a reasonable and pragmatic response to widespread hardware and software inconsistencies. The consensus is that while the feature is valuable for security, enabling it by default for a general-purpose application was a "foot gun" due to the unreliability of TPMs across the diverse ecosystem of consumer devices. A Tailscale engineer confirmed that the change was made to reduce support load, citing numerous non-malicious issues where TPMs became inaccessible after OS updates, firmware changes, or hardware swaps, causing the client to fail to start.

Discussion participants highlighted that TPMs are better suited for controlled, enterprise environments where hardware is standardized and managed. The core problem is that a TPM-bound key offers no recovery path; if the TPM is reset or becomes unavailable, the encrypted data is permanently lost. While some argued this is the correct security posture to defend against physical attacks, it proved too fragile for the average user. The debate also touched on a broader theme in software: the tension between shipping secure-by-default features and ensuring a stable experience for all users, with Tailscale ultimately prioritizing reliability over what some saw as ideal security.

## [A closer look at a BGP anomaly in Venezuela](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-route-leak-venezuela/)
**Score:** 339 | **Comments:** 182 | **ID:** 46538001

> **Article:** The Cloudflare article analyzes a BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomaly that occurred in Venezuela, likely during the major power outages in March 2019. The analysis concludes that the event was most likely a **route leak**, not a deliberate interception or "man-in-the-middle" attack.

The key evidence pointing to a leak is the presence of **AS-path prepending**, a technique where an AS number is repeated multiple times to artificially lengthen the route path. This makes the path less attractive to BGP's decision-making process, essentially signaling "do not use this route." A state actor trying to intercept traffic would want to make their route *more* attractive, not less. The article suggests the cause was a misconfiguration, possibly a missing "deny-all" clause in a route map intended for internal traffic engineering that inadvertently leaked to the global internet.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: the nature of the anomaly, the broader implications of internet infrastructure control, and the technical complexities of BGP.

A significant portion of the debate focused on whether the event was an accident or a deliberate attack. While the article's "accident" theory was widely accepted due to the unattractive route path, some commenters argued that a sophisticated state actor could still manipulate routes in less obvious ways. The consensus leaned towards a "fat finger" configuration error, reinforcing the idea that BGP is a fundamentally trust-based system vulnerable to simple mistakes.

The second major theme was the concentration of internet infrastructure within US-based companies, particularly Cloudflare. This sparked a debate about trust and geopolitics. Some users expressed alarm and a loss of trust, fearing the deep ties between US corporations and government agencies could compromise global data integrity. Others countered that this concentration is a natural result of the internet's US origins and that anycast networks like Cloudflare inherently have the visibility needed for such analysis, regardless of nationality.

Finally, the discussion touched on the technical depth of BGP. Several users sought resources to understand the concepts, while others provided context on its complexity. A commenter shared a mental model for diagnosing such incidents, focusing on the speed of the change, path symmetry, and "who benefits" from the new routing paths.

## [The Jeff Dean Facts](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/TheJeffDeanFacts)
**Score:** 294 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46540498

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub repository titled "The Jeff Dean Facts," a collection of humorous and hyperbolic anecdotes about legendary Google engineer Jeff Dean. Written in the style of "Chuck Norris facts," the "facts" portray Dean as an almost superhuman programmer. Examples include: compiling code to find compiler bugs, writing a search engine in a weekend, shifting a bit so hard it moved to another computer, and the P=NP joke ("P=0 or N=1"). The collection serves as a tribute to his immense impact on Google's infrastructure, including MapReduce, Bigtable, and the search index.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement, nostalgia, and thoughtful commentary. The discussion largely centered on the authenticity of the "facts" and the cultural context of Jeff Dean's legendary status.

Many commenters shared personal anecdotes confirming specific stories. For example, several users corroborated the claim that Don Knuth once had to sit on the floor at a crowded Jeff Dean seminar. Another user provided a detailed account of the "true" fact regarding Dean's vacation causing production issues, explaining that a critical internal tool (a protobuf debug database) ran on his personal workstation, and its dependencies broke when his credentials expired while he was away.

The conversation also explored the cultural origins of the format, distinguishing it from Chuck Norris jokes and noting its similarity to "The Most Interesting Man in the World" ad campaign. While some viewed Dean's celebrity as a sign of a healthy meritocracy where engineers are valued, others offered a more critical perspective, noting that such towering figures can make other talented engineers feel "unworthy" and that a meritocracy isn't proven just because one exceptional person succeeded. Overall, the tone was appreciative, with users enjoying the humor and the shared history of early Google engineering culture.

## [ICE Is Going on a Surveillance Shopping Spree](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/ice-going-surveillance-shopping-spree)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 252 | **ID:** 46534581

> **Article:** This article from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argues that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is undergoing a massive expansion of its surveillance capabilities. The author expresses alarm that ICE is rapidly acquiring and deploying advanced technologies—including data aggregation platforms (like those from LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters), location tracking tools, and facial recognition software—to monitor not just undocumented immigrants, but a vast number of people, including US citizens. The EFF warns that this creates a powerful, extra-judicial surveillance apparatus with minimal oversight, which poses a grave threat to the privacy and civil liberties of everyone in the United States.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of ICE, with commenters expressing alarm and drawing historical parallels to authoritarian regimes. The conversation was significantly shaped by a breaking news event that occurred the same day.

A major theme was the immediate and visceral reaction to the news that ICE agents had shot and killed a US citizen in Minneapolis. This event transformed the article's theoretical warnings into a stark reality for many commenters, who saw it as proof that ICE is operating as a violent, out-of-control force. This led to direct comparisons of ICE to the Nazi SA and the East German Stasi, with users arguing the agency is becoming a paramilitary "armed wing of the Party" that undermines due process.

The discussion also delved into the mechanics of surveillance. One user argued that the core problem is the shift from manpower-intensive surveillance (which acts as a natural check on power) to automated, mass data collection like license plate readers and facial recognition, which enables casual and widespread monitoring. The debate touched on whether such surveillance can be stopped, with some pointing to legal precedents and others noting that the technology is already normalized.

Finally, commenters explored the motivations behind ICE's actions. One user claimed that agents receive financial incentives (bounties) for each deportation, suggesting this drives them to target "low-hanging fruit" like workers and those attending court hearings rather than dangerous criminals. The overall sentiment was one of deep concern, with users debating the potential for future historical judgment of those involved and questioning the very purpose of such a heavily armed domestic enforcement agency.

## [Kernel bugs hide for 2 years on average. Some hide for 20](https://pebblebed.com/blog/kernel-bugs)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46536340

> **Article:** The article analyzes the lifespan of bugs in the Linux kernel by mining Git commit history for "Fixes:" tags. It finds that bugs remain undetected for an average of 2.1 years, with some persisting for over 20 years. The study identifies that bugs in subsystems like drivers/Can and networking protocols (SCTP, IPv4) have the longest lifespans, while memory management and GPU bugs are fixed more quickly. The most common types of long-lived bugs are race conditions (avg. 5.1 years), integer overflows, and use-after-free errors. The author concludes that while automated tools are improving, the complexity of hardware interaction and concurrent state machines makes these specific bugs particularly difficult to catch early.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the nature of long-lived bugs, the role of programming languages, and the validity of the study's methodology. A significant portion of the thread debated the utility of Rust in preventing these specific bugs. While some argued that a "rewrite in Rust" would solve the issue, others countered that the study's data shows most long-lived bugs are logic errors (race conditions, hardware spec misunderstandings) rather than memory safety issues, which Rust's borrow checker cannot inherently prevent.

Other key themes included:
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Users compared the Linux kernel's bug rate to Firefox, Windows, and macOS, generally agreeing that all complex software suffers from long-lived bugs.
*   **Architectural Critique:** One commenter argued that the monolithic kernel design itself is the vulnerability, advocating for microkernels like seL4 or Genode.
*   **Methodological Scrutiny:** Debate arose over the study's reliance on "Fixes:" tags (covering only ~28% of commits). One side argued this extrapolation is flawed, while the other defended the sample size as statistically significant provided there is no sampling bias.
*   **External Factors:** A user noted that third-party security patchsets (like grsecurity) often fix bugs that aren't contributed back upstream, leading to bugs persisting in the mainline kernel for years.

## [Iran Goes Into IPv6 Blackout](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/ir)
**Score:** 236 | **Comments:** 146 | **ID:** 46542683

> **Article:** The article, sourced from a Cloudflare routing radar dashboard, reports a massive and sudden drop in IPv6 traffic originating from Iran, effectively putting the country into an "IPv6 blackout." IPv6 connectivity plummeted to near zero, while IPv4 traffic also saw a significant, though less complete, reduction. The data suggests a severe disruption in internet connectivity, potentially caused by a technical failure, a cyberattack, or a deliberate government shutdown.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion overwhelmingly concludes that the IPv6 blackout is a deliberate act of censorship by the Iranian government to suppress ongoing anti-government protests. Commenters speculate that the government's network engineers may be less proficient with the newer IPv6 protocol, leading them to shut it down entirely rather than attempting to selectively block it. The conversation highlights the country's history of internet shutdowns and its efforts to build a resilient national intranet that can function without international access.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on circumvention tools. Users point to the presence of Starlink terminals as a key reason the government cannot enforce a complete blackout, despite their complaints about the service. However, this is tempered by the counterpoint that Starlink is largely inaccessible to the average Iranian citizen. Other potential workarounds mentioned include Yggdrasil (an overlay network) and LoRA/sneakernet-style solutions.

The conversation also touches on broader themes, with one commenter noting that even countries suffering from long-term brain drain can still find highly skilled individuals to implement sophisticated censorship and control measures. The community also shared links to news articles and a map visualizing the widespread protests.

## [Fighting back against biometric surveillance at Wegmans](https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/07/dont-let-the-grocery-store-scan-your-face-a-guide-to-fighting-back-against-biometric-surveillance-at-wegmans/)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46535514

> **Article:** The article on Adafruit, titled "Don't let the grocery store scan your face," is a guide on how to fight back against biometric surveillance at Wegmans. The author outlines several methods to avoid facial recognition, including wearing N95 masks, sunglasses, and hats. It also suggests more advanced techniques like using "adversarial makeup" patterns designed to confuse AI, or even high-quality face masks. The article advises consumers to switch to retailers with stronger privacy policies, such as Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and Food Bazaar, and to use cash for payments to avoid being tracked through card transactions. The core message is a call to action for individuals to actively protect their privacy against increasing corporate surveillance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep skepticism about the possibility of individuals escaping biometric surveillance, with many commenters arguing that the "ship has sailed." A central theme is the futility of simple countermeasures. Several users point out that facial recognition software can identify people even with masks, and that other data points like gait analysis, phone tracking, payment methods (even cash if sourced from a bank), and store loyalty cards make it trivial to link an identity to a person, regardless of whether their face is scanned at the register. The idea that obfuscation techniques might even make a person *more* interesting to tracking algorithms was also raised.

There was a strong debate on the motivations and scope of this surveillance. While some see it as a tool for loss prevention (e.g., building felony cases against repeat shoplifters), others believe the true purpose is commercial data analysis to "screw you over more." The normalization of surveillance was a significant concern, with one commenter noting that accepting it at airports (TSA) paves the way for its use in grocery stores.

Regarding solutions, the consensus leaned away from individual actions and toward systemic change. The most popular suggestion was to push for strong legislation governing data retention (e.g., short, mandatory deletion periods) and restricting data sharing between corporations and government entities. The idea of "fighting back" through "noise"—a technological DDoS of the surveillance state by flooding it with useless data—was also proposed as a more effective strategy than individual masking. There was also a cynical thread about the lack of alternatives, as even "privacy-friendly" stores like Whole Foods are owned by data-hungry giants like Amazon.

## [ICE's Tool to Monitor Phones in Neighborhoods](https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-tool-to-monitor-phones-in-entire-neighborhoods/)
**Score:** 206 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46543420

> **Article:** The article from 404 Media reports on ICE's use of a tool called "HawkEye 600" to monitor cellular devices in entire neighborhoods. This technology, originally designed for military use in conflict zones like Iraq and Afghanistan, captures data from all phones within its range, allowing authorities to identify every individual in a specific area. The system works by tricking phones into connecting to it, enabling the collection of metadata and potentially the interception of communications. The article highlights the expansion of such surveillance tools from military to domestic law enforcement use, raising significant privacy and civil liberties concerns.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by significant alarm and a sense of political disillusionment regarding the reported surveillance. A primary theme is the call for political action and accountability, with many commenters expressing that the only effective response is to vote out the officials responsible and hold politicians accountable at all levels of government. This sentiment is tinged with cynicism, as users debate whether any political faction, including the libertarian right, genuinely prioritizes civil liberties over their own agendas.

A second major theme revolves around personal mitigation strategies. This splits into two camps: one advocating for individual technological solutions, such as using Faraday cage bags (like M.I.A.'s brand), ditching mobile phones entirely, or employing clever workarounds like rogue Wi-Fi hotspots. The other camp, however, argues that the root problem is societal and cannot be solved by individual actions alone, emphasizing that the focus should be on systemic change rather than personal gadgetry.

Finally, commenters draw broader parallels to other privacy threats, noting that while government surveillance is alarming, it exists alongside massive data collection by corporations like Google. The discussion also touches on the difficult trade-offs of modern technology, weighing the benefits of having a phone (e.g., for emergency services, recording abuses) against the inherent risks of being tracked. The overall tone is one of deep concern over the normalization of mass surveillance and the erosion of civil liberties.

## [Minnesota officials say they can't access evidence after fatal ICE shooting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/minnesota-officials-say-they-cant-access-evidence-after-fatal-ice-shooting-and-fbi-wont-work-jointly-on-investigation)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46543457

> **Article:** A PBS NewsHour article reports that Minnesota officials are unable to access evidence related to the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. The head of Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) states that the U.S. Attorney's office has cut off the state's access to the investigation, and the FBI is refusing to work jointly with state authorities. This lack of cooperation is hindering the state's ability to investigate the use-of-force incident.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the incident and the subsequent lack of transparency, with many users expressing frustration over the federal government's handling of the investigation. A central theme is the perceived double standard in law enforcement: several commenters argue that the vast surveillance and investigative apparatus functions effectively against ordinary citizens but fails to protect them or hold powerful agents accountable. One user explicitly calls this a pattern of "moves to minimize visibility of government wrongdoing" on the platform itself, a sentiment that sparked a side-debate about moderation.

There is significant skepticism towards the official narrative, with users questioning the tactics used by law enforcement and predicting that the agent will face no consequences, citing a familiar pattern of internal investigations clearing officers and civil settlements that don't lead to policy changes. The political nature of the event is also a key topic, with comments on the Trump administration's role in reportedly blocking cooperation between federal and state agencies. The discussion also touches on the modern information landscape, noting how citizen smartphone footage has changed the ability to document such events, while also raising concerns about the future threat of AI-generated misinformation.

## [Play Aardwolf MUD](https://www.aardwolf.com/)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46534777

> **Article:** The article is a link to the homepage of Aardwolf, a modern Multi-User Dungeon (MUD). MUDs are text-based online role-playing games where players explore a world, complete quests, and interact with each other through text commands. The post serves as a reminder of this classic gaming genre.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a nostalgic trip down memory lane for many users, who share their personal experiences with MUDs, particularly Aardwolf. Several commenters credit the game with teaching them essential skills like touch-typing and even inspiring their careers in programming.

While the overall tone is positive, there are a few key points of critique and advice:
*   **Commercialization:** A user warns that some popular MUDs have adopted "premium shops" and other monetization features common in modern MMOs, advising newcomers to be mindful of this.
*   **New Player Experience:** One user shared a frustrating initial experience with Aardwolf's character creation, spending 10 minutes trying to find a usable name, which led to a brief discussion on the barriers to entry for new players.
*   **Community and Decline:** Several users note that while MUDs were more popular in the 90s and early 2000s, many have declined in population. There's a shared sentiment that poor management by volunteer coders can sometimes drive players away.

The conversation also serves as a hub for recommendations, with users suggesting other MUDs like Discworld (praised for its player-driven world), MUME (for its Tolkien setting and map features), and Achaea.

## [Claude Code CLI was broken](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16673)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46532075

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue for Anthropic's "Claude Code CLI," reporting that the tool is broken. The core problem, as detailed in the discussion, is that a recent update to the project's `CHANGELOG.md` file included dates in the version headers (e.g., `## 2.1.0 (2026-01-07)`). The CLI's code, which parses this markdown file to fetch release notes, was not equipped to handle this new format. It uses the version strings as keys and attempts to sort them using a `semver` library function, which fails on strings containing the date suffix, causing the entire application to crash on startup.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the nature of the bug, the quality of the engineering, and the broader context of AI-assisted development. The primary reaction was one of criticism and disbelief that a company like Anthropic would have such a fundamental failure in its own tool. Commenters found it "diabolical" and "embarrassing" that the application would parse a markdown file into a data structure without any error handling, and that it lacked the most basic integration tests to catch such a crash on startup.

Several workarounds were proposed, including a set of `sed` commands to patch the minified JavaScript file directly and a simpler fix to manually clear and lock the cache file that stores the changelog. The incident was quickly fixed by Anthropic, but it sparked a deeper conversation about the tool's development process. A key point of discussion was a claim from a Claude Code creator that the tool had written 100% of his code recently. Users expressed skepticism, noting the irony that a tool built to write code had a bug that could have been caught by a simple test, which itself could be automated by an AI agent. The conversation concluded with a meta-comment on the "exciting" and chaotic pace of development in the AI space, likening it to a major software release.

## [Go.sum is not a lockfile](https://words.filippo.io/gosum/)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46537095

> **Article:** Summary unavailable.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a significant split in understanding, largely along language-experience lines. The central debate is whether `go.mod` truly functions as a lockfile.

*   **Go's Mechanism vs. Other Languages:** Many commenters, particularly those familiar with Go, clarify that Go's Minimum Version Selection (MVS) is fundamentally different from the "latest compatible version" resolution used by npm, Cargo, or Maven. Because MVS selects the minimum required version from the dependency graph, and `go.mod` (with modern Go versions) pins all versions, it provides deterministic, reproducible builds without a separate lockfile. This is contrasted with other ecosystems where a lockfile is essential to prevent versions from floating to newer, potentially breaking releases.

*   **Security and Reproducibility:** A key point of confusion is the role of hashes. Commenters note that in other ecosystems, lockfiles provide hashes for security. It's clarified that `go.sum` serves this security role by ensuring the integrity of the downloaded code, while `go.mod` provides the version reproducibility.

*   **Practical Issues and Edge Cases:** Some developers express skepticism, citing real-world problems. These include poorly behaved libraries that create massive dependency graphs, the inability to set upper version bounds, and issues with private proxies or amended tags where `go.mod` alone might not catch a change. The `vendor` directory is mentioned as a way to achieve absolute reproducibility.

*   **Tooling and Workflow:** A practical complaint is that CI tools (like GitHub's `setup-go`) still incorrectly treat `go.sum` as the primary lockfile, leading to confusion and workflow issues, though there is hope this will be fixed.

In essence, the discussion highlights that `go.mod` is a lockfile by Go's design, but this is non-obvious to those accustomed to lockfiles in other ecosystems.

## [AI misses nearly one-third of breast cancers, study finds](https://www.emjreviews.com/radiology/news/ai-misses-nearly-one-third-of-breast-cancers-study-finds/)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46537983

> **Article:** An article from EMJ Reviews reports on a study where an AI system, analyzing MRI scans, missed nearly one-third of breast cancers. The study, conducted retrospectively on a dataset of patients already known to have cancer, found that the AI model detected approximately 71% of the cancers. The article notes that when human radiologists reviewed the scans the AI missed, they were able to find a significant portion of those overlooked lesions, but a gap in detection remained even with human oversight. The study's design, which used only positive cases (patients with confirmed cancer), was highlighted as a key limitation, as it could not measure the AI's rate of false positives (incorrectly flagging healthy tissue as cancerous).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion heavily critiques the study's methodology and the article's framing, arguing that the findings are misleading and lack crucial context. The central point of contention is the study's retrospective design, which used only images from patients with confirmed cancer. This means the study could only measure the AI's sensitivity (its ability to find cancer that is present) but could not calculate its specificity (its ability to correctly identify healthy tissue), a metric users called "crucial" since the vast majority of screenings are on healthy individuals.

Many commenters argued that the study did not provide a fair comparison between AI and human radiologists. It was not a head-to-head test, as the radiologists were only asked to review the specific scans the AI had already missed, a task that invites confirmation bias. The study's utility was therefore seen as limited to assessing the potential sensitivity of one specific, now-outdated AI model for fully automated screening, rather than its performance as an assistive tool.

Discussion points can be grouped into three main themes:
*   **Methodological Flaws:** The most prominent theme was the study's lack of a control group (healthy patients) and its use of a "case series" on known cancer patients. This design flaw makes it impossible to determine the AI's real-world utility, as a high false positive rate could lead to unnecessary biopsies and patient anxiety, a cost not measured here.
*   **Framing and Generalization:** Users strongly objected to the headline's use of the monolithic term "AI," arguing it unfairly generalizes the performance of one model to the entire field. They pointed out that AI is a rapidly evolving technology, and a 2021 model is not representative of the state-of-the-art.
*   **Real-World Application:** Commenters debated the proper role for such a tool. The consensus was that AI should be an assistant to, not a replacement for, human experts. The idea of using AI as a "second read" or in parallel with radiologists was seen as a more promising approach than full automation.

Overall, the community viewed the article as a poor piece of science journalism that amplified a flawed study, creating a sensationalized and inaccurate narrative about AI's capabilities in medicine.

## [AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-coding-degrades)
**Score:** 132 | **Comments:** 171 | **ID:** 46542036

> **Article:** The article, "AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse," from IEEE Spectrum, argues that the performance of large language models (LLMs) on coding tasks is degrading over time. The author posits this is due to a feedback loop where models are increasingly trained on AI-generated content from the web, leading to "model collapse" or "data pollution." The article highlights a specific benchmark test where models are asked to write a function that sorts a list while explicitly being told to ignore the obvious, correct solution (using `sort()`). The author claims newer models are more likely to produce flawed, "clever" but incorrect code to satisfy the prompt's constraints, rather than pointing out the flawed request, demonstrating a decline in reasoning and an increase in sycophancy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's premise and methodology. A dominant theme is that the article's benchmark test is "silly" and a poor representation of real-world usage. Commenters argue that intentionally giving a model flawed or contradictory instructions and then criticizing its flawed output is not a valid measure of performance. They suggest that a better test would be to see if the model identifies the flawed prompt, or to simply ask for a sort function without the confusing constraints.

Several alternative theories are proposed for why AI coding performance might *seem* worse to some users. One popular idea is that the quality of public code resources, particularly Stack Overflow, has declined, polluting the training data. Another is that as developers use AI for more complex tasks, the models' limitations become more apparent.

Conversely, many commenters share personal experiences directly contradicting the article, stating that their AI assistants are improving and are highly effective when used correctly. This leads to a strong emphasis on user skill and methodology. The consensus is that the quality of the output is highly dependent on the user's prompts, the model version, the IDE/extension used, and providing sufficient context (like a well-written `agent.md` file). The idea that AI coding is getting worse is largely dismissed as an "out of touch" take, with the real issue being the need for better user practices rather than a fundamental decline in the models themselves.

## [IBM AI ('Bob') Downloads and Executes Malware](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/ibm-ai-(-bob-)-downloads-and-executes-malware)
**Score:** 132 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46544454

> **Article:** The article, from Prompt Armor, details a security vulnerability in IBM's AI coding agent, named "Bob." The agent was successfully tricked by a prompt injection attack into downloading and executing malware. The attack worked by embedding malicious instructions within a file that Bob was asked to process. The instructions were disguised using command substitution syntax (e.g., `$(...)`), which Bob's own security rules claimed to block, but the underlying implementation failed to actually do so. This allowed the agent to be deceived into running a malicious command that appeared to be a simple `echo` statement, ultimately compromising the system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the technical and philosophical implications of the vulnerability. The core consensus was that the incident was a classic failure to properly separate data from executable logic, a problem exacerbated by LLMs' inherent ambiguity. Commenters noted that the security failure was particularly ironic because the agent's own documentation claimed to block the exact command substitution technique that was used to exploit it.

There was a strong sentiment that allowing AI agents to execute arbitrary code without strict, human-in-the-loop approval or in a heavily sandboxed environment is fundamentally reckless. Many felt this was a predictable outcome of the rush to integrate AI into development workflows, with some questioning IBM's relevance in the coding tool space while others saw it as a necessary move for any enterprise platform vendor. The non-deterministic nature of LLMs was cited as a key challenge in securing them, leading to the conclusion that the safest approach is to never trust them with unsupervised execution privileges.

## [Chase to become new issuer of Apple Card](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/news/2026/chase-to-become-new-issuer-of-apple-card)
**Score:** 129 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46536848

> **Article:** JPMorgan Chase announced it will become the new issuer of the Apple Card, taking over from Goldman Sachs. The partnership is expected to begin in 2026. The announcement confirms the long-speculated end of the partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs, which has been reported to be unprofitable for the bank.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely speculative, focusing on the "why" behind the move and the implications for cardholders. A primary theme is the financial viability of the Apple Card for its issuer. Users suggest Goldman Sachs likely lost a significant amount of money on the deal, with one commenter calling the existing portfolio "toxic waste" based on reported credit loss figures. This financial pressure is seen as the main driver for the change.

Another major topic is the unique features of the Apple Card and whether they will survive the transition. Users recall that Goldman Sachs agreed to unusual terms, such as eliminating late fees (only charging interest) and synchronizing statement dates, which caused customer support to be overwhelmed annually. There is significant concern about whether Chase will maintain these consumer-friendly policies, especially given Chase's standard $40 late fee.

Commenters also debated the card's value proposition. While some were impressed by the 2-3% cash back and "no fees" marketing, others pointed out that it's only a competitive card for Apple purchases or for those already in the Apple ecosystem. The physical card's titanium construction and lack of contactless payment were also noted, with users divided on whether this was a design flaw or a security feature intended to push users toward Apple Pay. Ultimately, the community is uncertain about the reasons for the switch, debating whether Apple or Goldman Sachs initiated the split.

## [Japanese electronics store pleads for old PCs amid ongoing hardware shortage](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/pc-building/major-japanese-electronics-store-begs-customers-for-their-old-pcs-as-hardware-drought-continues-we-pretty-much-buy-any-pc-pleads-the-akihabara-outlet)
**Score:** 126 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46542015

> **Article:** A major Japanese electronics store, Softmap in Akihabara, is publicly asking customers to sell their old PCs due to a severe hardware shortage. The store states they will "buy any PC," highlighting the desperation to acquire inventory to meet ongoing demand for computer components and systems in Japan. The article frames this as a response to the persistent drought of new hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on several key themes. Many commenters express support for reusing older hardware, viewing the shortage as an opportunity to reduce e-waste and potentially encourage better software optimization for less powerful machines. However, others are skeptical, citing examples like Discord requiring significant RAM, suggesting that software trends continue to demand more resources regardless of hardware availability.

The conversation also touches on the economics of the situation. Some users point out that while high prices might encourage better resource utilization, the stores themselves are likely offering very low buy-back prices, buying hardware for a fraction of its value and reselling it at a significant markup. There is also a debate on the value of "old" hardware, with one user surprised to find their 2019-era PC components still hold considerable value, while another notes that a 15-year-old system is now unexpectedly valuable.

Finally, commenters discuss the local context of the Japanese PC market. While Japan has not traditionally been a hub for PC gaming, some note its recent growth. Users also share anecdotal evidence of finding cheap RAM in rural Japanese used electronics stores, suggesting the price hikes aren't universally felt everywhere in the country.
