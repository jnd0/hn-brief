## [Project Patchouli: Open-source electromagnetic drawing tablet hardware](https://patchouli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
**Score:** 409 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46537489

> **Article:** Project Patchouli is an open-source hardware and software project for an electromagnetic (EMR) drawing tablet. The project provides detailed documentation, schematics, and source files, enabling anyone to build their own high-quality tablet from scratch. The core innovation is a reverse-engineered implementation of the EMR technology used in professional tablets like Wacom. A standout feature demonstrated is the ability to retrofit this technology into existing devices, such as an old laptop screen, turning it into a custom drawing tablet. The project is named after the Touhou character Patchouli Knowledge, and the introductory video features music from the series.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to Project Patchouli is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters expressing admiration for the project's technical depth, the quality of its documentation, and the creator's execution. The discussion centers on a few key themes:

*   **Technical Appreciation:** Users are particularly impressed by the high production quality of the project's introductory video and the ingenuity of retrofitting the EMR hardware into a Panasonic laptop screen at the end.
*   **Cultural Nods:** Several commenters identify the project's name and the video's background music as references to the Touhou Project video game series, leading to a positive discussion about the intersection of "otaku" culture and open-source hardware hacking.
*   **Learning and Accessibility:** A prominent sub-thread involves a software engineer expressing a desire to learn electrical engineering. This sparked a debate on the best way to enter the field, with advice ranging from formal study (the classic "Art of Electronics" book) to a more hands-on, exploratory approach of disassembling and repairing old electronics.
*   **Patents and Industry:** One user inquired about patents, leading to a discussion on how Wacom's key patents have expired, which explains the recent boom in affordable drawing tablets. It's also speculated that companies like Apple stick with more proprietary active pen technology for business reasons (rent-seeking via MFi fees).

## [Open Infrastructure Map](https://openinframap.org)
**Score:** 400 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46536866

> **Article:** The article links to Open Infrastructure Map, an open-source, OpenStreetMap-based visualization of the world's energy infrastructure. The map displays high-voltage power lines, substations, power plants (including renewables like wind and solar), oil and gas pipelines, and undersea cables. The goal is to provide a comprehensive, transparent view of the critical infrastructure that powers modern society, allowing users to explore how energy is generated, transmitted, and consumed on a global scale.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the map was overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing fascination at seeing the hidden "nervous system" of the planet, such as the vast network of undersea cables and the step-down of power lines from transmission to distribution. The discussion quickly evolved into several key themes:

A major point of debate was the security implications of such open data. Some argued that publishing the precise locations of critical infrastructure is a bad idea, making it a target for sabotage, a point underscored by a recent real-world incident where a power exchange was deliberately set on fire in Berlin. Others countered that this is a "security through transparency" argument, similar to open-source software, where revealing vulnerabilities forces operators to build more robust and resilient systems.

Users also delved into specific regional infrastructure details. There was a notable discussion about the Texas grid, with one user questioning its supposed isolation from the national grid. The conversation clarified that the Texas Interconnection is a distinct political and economic entity, not a technical one, and that it is interconnected with other grids via DC lines, though it operates largely independently.

Finally, the discussion touched on ambitious future projects and data completeness. A user proposed a transatlantic power cable to share solar energy between continents, which sparked a technical conversation about the feasibility, energy loss, and immense material costs involved. On the topic of data, users noted that the map's completeness varies by region; for example, the lack of infrastructure shown for Alice Springs, Australia, was attributed to a combination of sparse population, mapping challenges (e.g., underground lines), and the limitations of OpenStreetMap's volunteer-driven data collection.

## [A closer look at a BGP anomaly in Venezuela](https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-route-leak-venezuela/)
**Score:** 358 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46538001

> **Article:** The Cloudflare article analyzes a major BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomaly that occurred in Venezuela on March 19, 2024. During a nationwide internet blackout, the Venezuelan ISP CANTV (AS8048) leaked over 30,000 IP prefixes to its upstream providers. These routes were then propagated globally, causing a "route leak" that diverted international traffic destined for various networks (including other Venezuelan ISPs and even US military networks) through CANTV's infrastructure in Caracas.

Cloudflare's analysis concludes that this was likely an accident rather than a malicious state-sponsored interception. The primary evidence for this is the use of AS-path prepending, a technique that artificially lengthens the routing path to make it less attractive to traffic. A malicious actor attempting a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack would likely try to make their route appear as short and reliable as possible. The incident highlights the fragility and trust-based nature of the global BGP routing system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around three main themes: the technical analysis of the incident, the geopolitical implications of US tech dominance, and the general state of BGP security.

Technically, commenters largely agreed with Cloudflare's "accidental misconfiguration" theory. One user noted that the AS-path prepending was a strong indicator of an accident, as padding paths in the wrong direction would be counterproductive for a MITM attack. However, another user cautioned against being too presumptuous, suggesting a sophisticated state actor could still manipulate traffic in less obvious ways. The conversation also touched upon the complexity of BGP traffic engineering, where even well-intentioned scripts for load balancing can cause widespread leaks if export filters are missing.

A significant portion of the discussion was highly critical of the centralization of internet infrastructure in the hands of US companies like Cloudflare. Several users expressed a loss of trust, fearing that such companies could be compelled by the US government to manipulate or censor traffic. This sparked a debate on internet sovereignty, with some arguing that the internet's US origins make this inevitable, while others called for non-US companies to migrate away from American providers. The Snowden leaks were even referenced to support the view that US intelligence agencies have a history of network manipulation.

Finally, there were meta-discussions about the frequency of such BGP leaks (with one user claiming to have experienced several personally) and a request for learning resources on the topic, which led to a clarification that BGP is a highly specialized skill set relevant primarily to backbone network operators.

## [The Jeff Dean Facts](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/TheJeffDeanFacts)
**Score:** 338 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46540498

> **Article:** The article is a GitHub repository containing "The Jeff Dean Facts," a collection of humorous, hyperbolic anecdotes about legendary Google engineer Jeff Dean. Written in the style of "Chuck Norris facts," the "facts" exaggerate his programming prowess to mythical levels. Examples include: "Jeff Dean compiles and runs his code before submitting, but only to check for compiler and CPU bugs," and "During his own Google interview... Jeff examined Google's public certificate and wrote the private key on the whiteboard." The collection serves as a tribute and a piece of insider tech culture folklore.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community discussion was largely positive, with users enjoying the nostalgia and humor of the "facts," which reminded many of the pre-AI boom era of Silicon Valley culture. Several commenters confirmed the truthfulness of specific anecdotes. The most detailed story, corroborated by multiple ex-Googlers, was that critical production services would sometimes break when Jeff Dean went on vacation. This was because a vital but unofficial "protocol buffer debug database" job ran on his personal workstation, and his credentials would expire during his absence.

The discussion also touched on the cultural impact of such figures. While some saw the reverence for Jeff Dean as a sign that engineers are valued in a meritocracy, others cautioned that it could create an impossibly high standard, making other talented engineers feel "unworthy" and noting that a system can promote one genius while still failing others. The conversation concluded with users debating the meme's origins, clarifying that it is a direct parody of the "Chuck Norris facts" format, not the "Most Interesting Man in the World" campaign.

## [Iran Goes Into IPv6 Blackout](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/ir)
**Score:** 326 | **Comments:** 240 | **ID:** 46542683

> **Article:** The article links to a Cloudflare Radar dashboard showing a dramatic and sudden drop in IPv6 traffic originating from Iran to near-zero levels, while IPv4 traffic also saw a significant, though less complete, reduction. The event is described as an "IPv6 blackout." The data visualizations indicate a near-total loss of IPv6 connectivity from the country, suggesting a deliberate and widespread network disruption rather than a localized technical failure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly converges on the cause of the blackout, identifying it as a deliberate act of censorship by the Iranian government. The consensus is that this is a response to the ongoing anti-government protests, with users noting that such internet shutdowns are a recurring tactic used to disrupt communication and organization among activists.

A key point of technical speculation is why IPv6 traffic was completely eliminated while IPv4 traffic was only partially reduced. One commenter humorously suggested it was due to a lack of competent network engineers who could properly block IPv6, leading them to shut it down entirely. More seriously, it's implied that the government's control mechanisms may be more mature or focused on IPv4, or that the partial IPv4 restoration is a concession for essential state services while maintaining a communications blackout for the general populace.

The conversation also explores the broader context of life under such censorship. Commenters discuss Iran's attempts to build a resilient national intranet that can function when international gateways are blocked. There is also significant discussion about the role of technologies like Starlink in circumventing these shutdowns, with users sharing reports that the Iranian government has complained about active Starlink terminals being used by activists to upload footage, though others caution that access to such technology is extremely limited for the average citizen. The discussion concludes with mentions of alternative decentralized networks and a general expression of support for the Iranian people.

## [ICE Is Going on a Surveillance Shopping Spree](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/ice-going-surveillance-shopping-spree)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 252 | **ID:** 46534581

> **Article:** This article from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argues that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on a "surveillance shopping spree," rapidly acquiring vast amounts of data and technology to monitor and track individuals. The author details how ICE has moved beyond its traditional immigration enforcement role to become a powerful domestic surveillance agency, purchasing access to commercial databases containing information like utility records, location data from license plate readers, and other personal data that would normally require a warrant. The EFF warns that this unregulated access to data allows ICE to conduct dragnet surveillance on a massive scale, targeting not just undocumented immigrants but potentially anyone in the United States, effectively creating a powerful domestic intelligence agency with minimal oversight.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of ICE and expresses significant alarm over the revelations in the article. The conversation quickly escalated from the article's content to a specific, tragic event that occurred the same day: the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Commenters used this incident as a focal point, arguing it was a grim validation of the article's warnings about ICE's increasingly militarized and violent nature.

A dominant theme in the discussion is the comparison of ICE to historical authoritarian organizations. Multiple users drew parallels between ICE's tactics and those of the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA) and the East German Stasi, suggesting the agency is being used to create a paramilitary force that operates outside the normal bounds of law and due process. There was a strong sense that ICE is undermining fundamental American principles, with one user noting the removal of people to camps without judicial oversight as a breakdown of the social contract.

The conversation also delved into the mechanics of mass surveillance. Commenters lamented the normalization of technologies like license plate readers and facial recognition, arguing that they have eroded privacy protections that once existed (such as the need for a warrant to place a tracker on a car). There was a debate about the legality of collecting public data, with some fearing that as long as data collection in public is legal, this surveillance state will continue to expand.

Finally, users discussed the motivations behind ICE's actions. One commenter claimed that agents receive financial incentives (bounties) for each deportation, which could explain the focus on targeting "low-hanging fruit" like individuals attending court hearings rather than dangerous criminals. The overall tone of the discussion was one of deep concern, with users expressing fear for the future of civil liberties in the U.S. and questioning the accountability of federal law enforcement agencies.

## [Google AI Studio is now sponsoring Tailwind CSS](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46545077

> **Article:** The article reports that Google AI Studio is now sponsoring Tailwind CSS. This news comes shortly after public discussion about the financial struggles of the Tailwind CSS team, specifically the layoffs of 75% of their staff. The sponsorship is seen as a direct response to these difficulties, potentially triggered by the Tailwind team's founder, Adam Wathan, attributing revenue issues to the rise of AI tools that can generate UI components, reducing the need for their paid offerings. Vercel also announced a sponsorship around the same time.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and analytical, viewing the sponsorship as a reactive move rather than a definitive solution to Tailwind's problems. A central theme is the ambiguity of the sponsorship's value; while it's positive news, commenters question if it's enough to solve the financial issues, noting that Tailwind was already receiving over $1M in annual sponsorships from numerous companies and still struggling. The sponsorship is interpreted by some as a "PR move" by Google to counter the narrative that AI is killing open source, especially since LLMs heavily rely on Tailwind and would be negatively impacted if the project collapsed.

There is also significant discussion around the root cause of Tailwind's financial decline. The consensus is that AI models have directly eroded Tailwind's business model by generating UI components that the company previously sold, and by reducing traffic to their documentation, which was a key channel for selling books and support services. The community also debated the fundamental economics of a CSS framework having paid employees, with one user explaining that the business model relied on selling premium content and support, both of which have been devalued by AI. Ultimately, while the sponsorship is welcomed, the community remains uncertain about its long-term impact on Tailwind's viability.

## [Kernel bugs hide for 2 years on average. Some hide for 20](https://pebblebed.com/blog/kernel-bugs)
**Score:** 272 | **Comments:** 146 | **ID:** 46536340

> **Article:** The article analyzes the lifespan of bugs in the Linux kernel by creating a dataset that links bug reports to the commits that fixed them. The key finding is that the average kernel bug remains undetected for approximately two years. The study breaks down this data by subsystem and bug type, revealing that certain areas like CAN drivers and SCTP networking have significantly longer-lived bugs (over 4 years on average), while others like BPF are much faster (1.1 years). Similarly, race conditions have the longest average lifespan (5.1 years), whereas null dereferences are found and fixed most quickly. The article also identifies common patterns in very old bugs (10+ years), such as refcounting errors and integer overflows, and discusses the limitations of its own dataset (which only covers ~28% of fixes). Ultimately, the analysis aims to provide data-driven insights to improve code review processes and focus on high-risk areas.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the broader context of software bugs, the specific limitations of the study, and the role of modern programming languages.

A significant portion of the conversation revolved around the longevity of bugs in general, with commenters noting that this is not unique to the Linux kernel. Several anecdotes were shared about long-lived bugs in other major projects, most notably a Firefox bug that remained open for 20 years until it was incidentally fixed by a complete rewrite of a component in Rust. This led to a sub-thread on the "rewrite in Rust" topic for the kernel. The consensus there was nuanced: while Rust would be a powerful tool for eliminating the majority of kernel bugs (specifically memory safety issues like use-after-free and buffer overflows), it would not necessarily prevent the more complex logic, race condition, and hardware-specific bugs highlighted in the article.

Other key discussion points included:
*   **Data Scrutiny:** Users questioned the validity of the study's findings, pointing out that it only analyzes bugs with "Fixes:" tags (a reported 28% of commits). However, another user countered that this is still a very large sample size, and the real concern should be potential sampling bias rather than the sample size itself.
*   **Architectural Critiques:** Some commenters used the data to argue for a fundamental redesign of kernel architecture, moving away from monolithic kernels (which run everything in privileged supervisor mode) towards microkernels like seL4 for enhanced security.
*   **Broader Industry Context:** The discussion also touched on the prevalence of long-lived bugs in other systems like Windows and the nature of proprietary vs. open-source code, with one user noting that "everything is open source if you're skilled with Ghidra."

## [Minnesota officials say they can't access evidence after fatal ICE shooting](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/minnesota-officials-say-they-cant-access-evidence-after-fatal-ice-shooting-and-fbi-wont-work-jointly-on-investigation)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46543457

> **Article:** A PBS NewsHour article reports that Minnesota officials are unable to access evidence related to the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agent in Minneapolis. The head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) stated that the U.S. Attorney's office has cut off their access to the investigation. The article highlights a conflict between state and federal authorities, with the FBI initially willing to cooperate on a joint investigation but reportedly being barred from doing so by a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor. This lack of cooperation obstructs the state's ability to conduct its own investigation into the fatal shooting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the federal government's actions and the handling of the investigation. A central theme is the perceived obstruction of justice by federal authorities, with users noting that the "surveillance apparatus" functions perfectly against ordinary citizens but fails to protect them or hold law enforcement accountable. Several commenters express outrage that the federal government is blocking a state investigation, with one user citing a source who claims a Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney specifically intervened to prevent FBI cooperation.

There is significant skepticism about the official narrative, with users pointing out the unusual tactics used by law enforcement and predicting that the officer will face no consequences. The conversation also touches on the role of technology, with one user noting that smartphones allow citizens to record incidents from multiple angles, challenging the government's monopoly on information, while another warns that AI-generated content could soon undermine this trust.

The discussion also becomes meta, with users debating the article's relevance to a tech-focused forum. One user argues that government actions are important for citizens to know and criticizes the site's moderation for allegedly suppressing such stories while allowing less political content to remain highly visible. This sparked a debate about HN's flagging and moderation policies.

## [ICE's Tool to Monitor Phones in Neighborhoods](https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-tool-to-monitor-phones-in-entire-neighborhoods/)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 224 | **ID:** 46543420

> **Article:** The article from 404 Media reports on a tool used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) called "HawkEye 600." This device allows authorities to monitor all cellular activity (calls, texts, data) within an entire neighborhood by tricking nearby phones into connecting to it. The article details how this technology functions as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, capturing metadata and potentially content, and highlights the lack of transparency and legal oversight regarding its use by domestic law enforcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by significant alarm and political frustration. The dominant sentiment is outrage at the government's encroachment on civil liberties, with many commenters drawing parallels to dystopian fiction like *1984* or China's social credit system.

A recurring theme is the debate over individual privacy versus collective responsibility. While some users suggest practical countermeasures like using Faraday bags, disabling cellular/Bluetooth connections, or abandoning smartphones entirely, others argue that the only true solution is political accountability. There is widespread cynicism regarding the political establishment, with users criticizing both major parties and libertarians for failing to protect civil liberties consistently.

The conversation also touches on the "privacy paradox" of big tech; however, commenters distinguish between corporate data collection and the government's ability to use these tools for direct surveillance and suppression. Practical concerns are raised about the trade-offs of leaving technology behind, specifically the loss of the ability to record police misconduct or coordinate protests, as well as the safety utility of having a phone for emergencies. Ultimately, the discussion reflects a sense of inevitability regarding mass surveillance and a search for effective resistance strategies in a hyper-connected world.

## [IBM AI ('Bob') Downloads and Executes Malware](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/ibm-ai-(-bob-)-downloads-and-executes-malware)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46544454

> **Article:** An article from Prompt Armor details a security vulnerability in IBM's AI coding agent, named 'Bob'. The agent was successfully tricked into downloading and executing malware on a developer's machine. The attack used a prompt injection technique where malicious instructions were hidden in a file the AI was asked to process. The core failure was that Bob's security controls, which were supposed to block commands containing dangerous shell substitutions (like `$(...)`), were implemented incorrectly and failed to prevent the malicious command from running. The vulnerability was triggered when the user had configured Bob to "always allow" command execution, a setting the documentation itself flags as high-risk.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the systemic security risks of AI agents with code execution capabilities. A primary theme was the fundamental danger of allowing LLMs to run arbitrary code without strict oversight. Many commenters argued that the user or the tool's configuration was at fault, particularly the "always allow" setting, with one user calling the practice of letting an AI execute self-generated code "absolutely bananas."

Several users analyzed the technical failure, suggesting it stemmed from "taking shortcuts" in parsing commands rather than robustly separating data from executable logic. This was framed as an inherent challenge with LLMs, whose "opportunistic" nature makes them difficult to secure. The difficulty of guarding against non-deterministic prompt injection vulnerabilities was a significant point of concern.

There was also commentary on IBM's role in the AI coding space, with some viewing it as an awkward attempt to stay relevant, while others noted it was a necessary move for any major enterprise cloud provider. The discussion concluded with a practical warning: placing untrusted instructions in a repository can likely be used to exploit any coding agent, highlighting the need for better sandboxing and user education.

## [Play Aardwolf MUD](https://www.aardwolf.com/)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46534777

> **Article:** The post is a simple link to the website for "Aardwolf MUD," a text-based multiplayer online role-playing game (MUD). The post itself serves as a reminder of the existence of MUDs, a genre of online games that predate modern graphical MMORPGs.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly evolved from a simple endorsement of Aardwolf into a broad, nostalgic conversation about the MUD genre. Many commenters shared personal stories of how playing MUDs in their youth taught them valuable skills like touch typing, social interaction, and even how to code. Several other MUDs were recommended, including Discworld, MUME, and Achaea, with users highlighting their unique features and fond memories.

A critical theme that emerged was the commercialization of the genre. One user warned that some modern MUDs have adopted "premium shops" and other monetization pitfalls common in modern MMOs. Another commenter noted the decline in player populations, contrasting the 200-player queues of Discworld's peak with its current, smaller community.

There was also a small sub-thread about the challenges of getting into MUDs today, with one user expressing frustration at a 10-minute name-approval process that made them question the game's premise. The conversation also touched on the technical side, with one user sharing their project to build a new MUD engine in Haskell, and another recalling the "Nightmare" MUD driver as a formative experience in learning to code.

## [Go.sum is not a lockfile](https://words.filippo.io/gosum/)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46537095

> **Article:** The article "Go.sum is not a lockfile" by Filippo Valsorda argues that `go.sum` is not a lockfile, but rather a security and integrity mechanism. He explains that a lockfile's primary purpose is to ensure reproducible builds by pinning exact dependency versions for a project. In Go, this role is fulfilled by `go.mod` combined with the module system's "minimal version selection" (MVS). MVS deterministically selects the minimum required version of each dependency needed to satisfy all constraints, making builds reproducible without a separate lockfile.

`go.sum`, on the other other hand, serves as a security cache. It stores the cryptographic checksums of dependencies to detect accidental changes or malicious tampering (e.g., if a tag is moved to point to different code). Its purpose is to verify the integrity of the fetched code, not to lock its version. Therefore, `go.mod` is the true lockfile, and `go.sum` is a security manifest.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a significant split between Go's design philosophy and developer expectations from other ecosystems. The core debate centers on whether `go.mod` is truly equivalent to a lockfile.

A major point of contention is the role of checksums. Many developers, particularly those from JavaScript or Python backgrounds, view cryptographic hashes as an essential part of a lockfile's function. They argue that without `go.sum`, there is no way to verify that the fetched dependencies are the exact, untampered versions intended. The article's premise that `go.sum` has "no effect on builds" is seen as dangerous by some, as it overlooks its critical security role in preventing supply chain attacks.

Another key theme is the difference in dependency resolution strategies. Commenters explain that Go's "minimal version selection" (MVS) is fundamentally different from the "latest compatible version" strategy used by tools like npm or Maven. This makes `go.mod` a reliable, deterministic lockfile by default, whereas other ecosystems require a separate lockfile to prevent upstream changes from breaking builds. However, some remain skeptical, pointing out that MVS can still upgrade transitive dependencies, which they feel undermines the "lock" aspect.

Finally, there is significant frustration with the practical implementation, especially in CI/CD. The `actions/setup-go` GitHub Action's default caching behavior is criticized for using `go.sum`'s modification time, which can lead to stale caches and broken builds. This practical friction leads some to argue that Go's reliance on "good citizen" dependencies is naive and that vendoring or more robust tooling is necessary to handle real-world complexities like private modules or amended tags.

## [AI coding assistants are getting worse?](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-coding-degrades)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46542036

> **Article:** The article from IEEE Spectrum, titled "AI Coding Assistants Are Getting Worse?", argues that the performance of large language models (LLMs) on coding tasks is degrading over time. The author, a software engineer, tested several leading models on a specific, tricky coding problem: creating a Python script to find duplicate files by hashing their contents. The models consistently failed by generating code that was superficially plausible but fundamentally flawed. For instance, they would ignore the specified constraint of not using external libraries, or they would implement a hashing algorithm that was inefficient and incorrect for files larger than a certain size. The author posits that this "degradation" may be due to models being trained on an increasing volume of low-quality, AI-generated code from the web, leading to a feedback loop that erodes their ability to reason from first principles and instead encourages them to produce syntactically correct but functionally unsound code.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was highly skeptical of the article's central premise and methodology. A dominant theme was the criticism of the author's test case as "silly," "flawed," or a "strawman." Many commenters argued that the prompt was poorly constructed, creating an impossible situation for the AI by asking it to solve a problem without using the most appropriate tools (libraries) and without providing necessary context (like test cases or error messages). They contended that a more effective approach would be to simply paste an error message or provide a clear, testable specification rather than imposing arbitrary constraints.

Another major thread focused on the practical realities of using AI coding assistants. Several users shared their positive experiences, stating that the tools are improving and are highly effective when used correctly. This led to a discussion on best practices, with commenters emphasizing that the quality of the output is highly dependent on the user's skill in crafting prompts, providing sufficient context (e.g., project configuration files), and using an iterative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The idea of running AI-generated code in a sandbox without human oversight was widely condemned as a "giant red flag."

Finally, there was a debate on the broader trends affecting AI performance. One user humorously noted the article's 2026 publication date, dismissing its claims. Others offered alternative theories for any perceived decline, such as the "Stack Overflow problem"—the idea that as fewer developers post high-quality, human-written code online, the training data for future models becomes less reliable. There was also a discussion about the desire to "pin" to specific model versions, similar to software packages, with others explaining the technical and business reasons why major providers phase out older models.

## [AI misses nearly one-third of breast cancers, study finds](https://www.emjreviews.com/radiology/news/ai-misses-nearly-one-third-of-breast-cancers-study-finds/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46537983

> **Article:** An article from EMJ Reviews reports on a study where an AI system, tasked with detecting breast cancer from mammograms and DWI scans, missed nearly one-third of cancers. The study used a commercial ConvNet model from 2021 and was conducted retrospectively on a dataset of women who were already known to have breast cancer. The AI detected 71% of the cancers, leading to the headline that it missed 29%. The study's primary goal was to assess the AI's sensitivity in identifying known cancers, rather than comparing its performance directly against human radiologists in a real-world screening scenario.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion heavily critiques the study's methodology and the article's framing, arguing that the results are misleading and lack crucial context. A key point of contention is the study's design: it was a retrospective case series that only included patients with confirmed cancer, meaning there were no healthy controls. This makes it impossible to determine the AI's false positive rate, a critical metric for a screening tool where the vast majority of patients are healthy. Users also note that the AI model and data are from 2021, which is considered ancient in the fast-moving AI field.

Many commenters argue that the study does not and cannot compare AI performance to human radiologists, as the humans in the study were unblinded and only asked to find cancers the AI had already missed. The discussion suggests that a more useful approach would be an AI-assisted workflow where the system acts as a "second reader" to catch human errors. There is also significant frustration with the media's tendency to refer to "AI" as a monolithic entity, rather than a specific model or system. Several users pointed out that even a 70% detection rate could be a net positive if the technology is cheap enough to enable much wider screening of the population.

## [Japanese electronics store pleads for old PCs amid ongoing hardware shortage](https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/pc-building/major-japanese-electronics-store-begs-customers-for-their-old-pcs-as-hardware-drought-continues-we-pretty-much-buy-any-pc-pleads-the-akihabara-outlet)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46542015

> **Article:** A major Japanese electronics store, Softmap in Akihabara, is publicly asking customers to sell them their old PCs. This unusual request is due to a severe and ongoing hardware shortage in Japan, which is impacting the availability of new and used components. The store states, "we pretty much buy any PC," highlighting the desperation to acquire inventory to meet customer demand.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around several key themes. There is a general consensus on the value of reusing older hardware, though some are cynical about whether this will actually spur software optimization. The conversation highlights the surprising value of older systems, with one user's 2019-era PC being considered "old" by the original poster but "perfectly fine" and valuable by others. This is contrasted by a user who successfully sold 20-year-old components, reinforcing the idea that any working hardware has some value.

Commenters also debated the broader implications of hardware shortages, with one user arguing that high prices force better resource utilization, while another countered that constant upgrades are necessary, citing the high resource demands of modern applications like Discord. The discussion also touched on the state of the PC market in Japan, noting that while Akihabara may not be a PC gaming hub, the market is experiencing growth. Finally, a practical debate emerged about the best way to sell used gear, weighing the convenience of selling a whole unit to a store like Hard Off against the potentially higher profit from parting it out, with one user noting that stores like Softmap buy low and sell high.

## [Chase to become new issuer of Apple Card](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir/news/2026/chase-to-become-new-issuer-of-apple-card)

> **Article:** JPMorgan Chase has announced it will become the new issuer of the Apple Card, taking over from Goldman Sachs. The official press release confirms the transition is expected to be completed by 2026. This marks a significant shift in the partnership that underpins the Apple Card's financial infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of speculation, nostalgia, and analysis of the card's value proposition. A primary theme was speculation on why the partnership ended, with users suggesting Goldman Sachs likely lost significant money on the deal and wanted to exit the volatile credit business. This led to questions about what concessions Apple might have made to secure a new partner like Chase, with some suggesting it might not have been Apple who "caved."

Discussion also revisited the Apple Card's unique features and drawbacks. Users debated its value, concluding it's excellent for Apple purchases and simple cash back, but less competitive for serious rewards chasers. The card's physical titanium design was noted as a novelty that lacks contactless payment, which some found ironic while others valued the security of always using a digital method. The conversation also touched on the card's history, including its initial 0% financing offers for Apple products and the high credit losses reported on Goldman Sachs's portfolio, which one user humorously called "toxic waste."

## [U.S. is withdrawing from 66 international bodies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-withdraws-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46535737

> **Article:** The article is a White House fact sheet announcing that President Donald J. Trump has issued an executive order to withdraw the United States from 66 international organizations, conventions, and treaties. The stated rationale is that these bodies are "contrary to the interests of the United States." The administration claims that American taxpayers have spent billions on these organizations with little return, and that they often criticize U.S. policies, advance contrary agendas, or waste taxpayer dollars. The withdrawal is framed as a move to save money and refocus resources on "America First" priorities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the withdrawal, viewing it as a damaging and strategically foolish move. The central themes are the negative impact on U.S. global standing, the political motivations behind the decision, and skepticism about the "America First" rationale.

Commenters argue that this move severely damages U.S. "soft power" and global influence, which are built on alliances and participation in the world order. Many see this as a retreat into isolationism that will ultimately diminish America's relevance on the world stage. The decision is widely interpreted as being heavily biased against climate change and environmental protection, as many of the listed organizations focus on these issues. This is seen as a politically motivated move to advance a specific partisan agenda rather than a genuine effort to serve national interests. There is also a strong sense of pessimism, with many commenters believing the damage to international trust is long-term or permanent and that the policy is incoherent, citing other aggressive U.S. actions abroad. A few users point out that such withdrawals are often reversed by subsequent administrations, though others are skeptical that the damage can be undone.
