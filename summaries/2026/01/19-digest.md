The Dead Internet Theory is no longer just a fringe hypothesis; it’s becoming a lived reality. The discussion on Hacker News confirms what many of us have suspected: the line between human and AI-generated content is vanishing. Users noted that linguistic tics once considered hallmarks of human writing—like em-dashes—are now common in LLM outputs, blurring the very definition of authentic communication. This isn’t just about bots posting spam; it’s about the homogenization of discourse, where algorithms and engagement metrics dictate what we see, creating a sterile, corporate-controlled digital landscape. The parallel concerns on Wikipedia, where a dedicated project now hunts for AI-generated "slop," underscore a broader crisis of authenticity across the entire web.

This AI saturation bleeds directly into the tools we build and use. The creator of Calquio, a financial calculator site, exemplifies how AI has lowered the barrier to entry, allowing a former developer to return to coding by letting an LLM handle the stack. Yet the community’s reaction was mixed, praising the accessibility while criticizing the generic, AI-generated feel of the output—a tension between rapid prototyping and the lingering need for human curation. This pattern repeats in the "Code-Only Agent" concept, where giving an AI a single tool (code execution) instead of a fixed set of functions is hailed as a powerful, flexible paradigm. However, a sharp counterpoint emerged: the real bottleneck isn't tool availability, but context management. Successful tools like Cursor succeed by proactively pushing relevant context to the model, a lesson that pure code-only approaches might overlook.

Meanwhile, the platforms we rely on are doubling down on "enshittification." Apple’s testing of a new App Store design that blurs ads with organic results is a classic move, prioritizing revenue over the user experience and safety that once justified its walled garden. Amazon’s decision to end inventory commingling is a rare reversal, a long-overdue fix to a system that prioritized logistics over authenticity, but it’s unlikely to restore the trust it spent years eroding. Microsoft, meanwhile, faces speculation about a future where it might ship a Windows-themed Linux distro, a strategic pivot to shed the cost of the NT kernel as its revenue shifts irrevocably to Azure and M365. The debate hinges on whether Windows' enterprise "moat" (Active Directory, Group Policy) is still defensible or just legacy baggage.

The erosion of digital rights continues, with a report detailing how Big Tech lobbying has weakened EU regulations like the DSA and AI Act. The discussion, however, revealed a deeper geopolitical anxiety: aggressive US policies are forcing the EU to confront its digital dependency on American tech, sparking calls for a European alternative. This isn't just about privacy; it's about sovereignty. A similar tension plays out in the Texas police's use of phone-tracking software, where law enforcement exploits the "public data" loophole to bypass warrants. The community’s cynicism was palpable, noting that this surveillance is enabled by a data-broker economy we all feed into, making meaningful reform feel increasingly hopeless.

Amidst this decay, niche projects offer alternatives. Bitchat, a Bluetooth-only messaging app, was met with skepticism over its limited range and technical shortcomings compared to established tools like Briar. Its utility is confined to specific, offline scenarios like protests, highlighting a growing demand for censorship-resistant tools. Similarly, Radboud University’s choice of Fairphone for employees was praised as a pragmatic in-house repair strategy, though it reignited debates about the device's hardware compromises and the elusive goal of a truly open, de-Googled smartphone. These projects are admirable but feel like lifeboats in a sea of corporate consolidation.

The legal and ethical battles over AI training data are heating up. Nvidia’s alleged use of pirated books from Anna’s Archive for AI training, defended as "fair use," is a stark example of the industry's "move fast and break things" ethos applied to intellectual property. This mirrors the broader tension on Wikipedia, where the encyclopedia fights AI-generated content while simultaneously selling data access to the very companies fueling the problem. It’s a cynical cycle where the commons are mined for profit, and the cleanup is left to volunteers.

Finally, the legacy systems that underpin critical infrastructure remain stubbornly resistant to the AI hype. The question about COBOL developers revealed a split: while some find AI useful for documentation or tedious tasks, others note that the language's proprietary dialects and lack of public training data limit its utility. This is a microcosm of a larger truth: AI excels at the generic but struggles with the specific, institutional knowledge that keeps the world running. It’s a reminder that while the future is being built with LLMs, the present is still held together by code written decades ago.

**Worth watching:** The EU's struggle for digital sovereignty, forced into the open by US tech dominance and political aggression, will be a defining tech policy battle of the next decade. The outcome will determine whether the internet fragments into regional blocs or remains a US-dominated space.
