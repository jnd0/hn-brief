## [Adoption of EVs tied to real-world reductions in air pollution: study](https://keck.usc.edu/news/adoption-of-electric-vehicles-tied-to-real-world-reductions-in-air-pollution-study-finds/)
**Score:** 544 | **Comments:** 527 | **ID:** 46749198

> **Article:** A study from USC Keck Medicine of Irvine analyzed satellite data of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels across California neighborhoods from 2019 to 2023. The research found a direct correlation between the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and improved air quality. Specifically, for every 200 additional ZEVs registered in a neighborhood, NO₂ levels dropped by approximately 1.1%. This indicates that the shift to electric vehicles is resulting in measurable, real-world reductions in local air pollution.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding the study is largely supportive of the findings, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes of the negative impacts of diesel and gasoline vehicles, particularly in urban environments. Many pointed to the immediate quality-of-life improvements in cities with high EV adoption, such as quieter streets and cleaner air.

However, the conversation also introduced several counterpoints and complexities regarding the environmental impact of EVs:
*   **Infrastructure and Vehicle Types:** Some argued that Tesla has yet to effectively disrupt the diesel truck market, noting that current EV trucks are not yet practical for widespread commercial use due to battery capacity and charging infrastructure limitations.
*   **Shifting Pollution:** A few commenters raised the concern that EVs might simply move pollution from urban centers to the locations of power plants. The consensus, however, was that centralizing pollution makes it easier to manage and filter, and that the overall emissions from EVs are still lower than ICE vehicles, even on fossil-fuel-heavy grids.
*   **Non-Exhaust Emissions:** While EVs eliminate tailpipe emissions, users noted that particulate matter from tire and brake wear remains a concern. It was clarified that the specific study focused on NO₂, which is not generated by tires or brakes.
*   **Lifecycle Environmental Costs:** A significant point of contention was the externalization of environmental costs, specifically the pollution caused by lithium mining. While acknowledged, most dismissed this as being less impactful than the continuous burning of fossil fuels.
*   **Infrastructure and Urban Planning:** The discussion broadened to include urban planning, with some commenters expressing pessimism about Western cities' ability to adapt and modernize compared to East Asian cities, where EV adoption is higher and public transit is more integrated.

## [A flawed paper in Management Science has been cited more than 6,000 times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 541 | **Comments:** 286 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The linked blog post from "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science" critiques a highly influential paper in the field of management science that has accumulated over 6,000 citations. The author, Andrew Gelman, argues that the paper contains significant flaws, likely in its statistical methodology or data analysis. The central thesis is that the academic community's reliance on citation counts as a proxy for validity is deeply flawed. The post highlights how a single, erroneous but "seminal" paper can become entrenched in the literature, influencing thousands of subsequent studies and establishing a false consensus based on faulty foundations. It serves as a case study for the broader "replication crisis" affecting various scientific disciplines.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes and systemic critiques of academic research. A dominant theme is the difficulty and personal risk involved in challenging flawed or fraudulent work. Several users recount experiences where attempts to replicate or retract papers were met with institutional resistance, political maneuvering, or the threat of career suicide for junior researchers. One commenter notes that their family member had to switch research fields entirely after discovering faked data, as speaking out would have been professionally ruinous.

Another major theme is the systemic incentive structure that rewards novelty over rigor. Users point out that the "publish or perish" culture, citation metrics, and the difficulty of getting replication studies funded or published create an environment where flawed but "exciting" results thrive. The idea of "citation rings" and authors uncritically citing work to bolster their own metrics was raised, with one user proposing a "trust network" overlay for the citation graph to combat this. However, others were skeptical, arguing that any such system would eventually be gamed.

The discussion also touched on the human element. While some commenters expressed cynicism about the motivations of researchers who produce subpar work, others debated the distinction between a "bad person" and a person making "bad choices" within a flawed system. The consensus was that the problem is not merely a few bad actors but a deeply ingrained cultural and structural issue within academia that prioritizes career advancement over scientific truth.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 507 | **Comments:** 251 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The linked article on netzbremse.de presents a formal complaint filed by the "Initiative for Network Neutrality" against Deutsche Telekom (DT). The core accusation is that DT is intentionally under-dimensioning its internet transit access points. This creates artificial bottlenecks, forcing external websites and services to pay for expensive, direct contracts with DT to ensure their content is delivered at acceptable speeds to DT's customers. The complaint argues this practice is a violation of net neutrality principles and constitutes an abuse of DT's dominant market position, particularly in areas where it acts as a de facto monopoly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of technical analysis, personal frustrations, and broader cultural commentary about Germany's internet infrastructure. A central theme is the widespread user experience of poor performance, especially with sites using services like Cloudflare, which users attribute to DT's poor peering practices and under-provisioned transit links. This leads to significant frustration, with some users resorting to alternatives like Starlink to escape DT's service quality, despite personal reservations about its owner.

The conversation also explores the systemic reasons for DT's market dominance. Users point to a lack of open-access infrastructure policies, which has allowed DT to maintain a monopoly in many new developments, leaving residents with no alternative provider. This situation is framed within a larger critique of German society, which one user describes as a series of contradictions: a leading economy with unstable infrastructure, strong worker protections alongside powerful lobbying, and a paradoxical approach to privacy and technology. The discussion concludes with a pragmatic debate on the use of platforms like YouTube to host the complaint video, with some criticizing the choice as hypocritical while others defend it as a necessary compromise for reach and sustainability.

## [ICE Using Palantir Tool That Feeds on Medicaid Data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 394 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This system aggregates data from various government sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses Medicaid records. The EFF argues that this integration of sensitive health data into law enforcement targeting tools represents a significant privacy violation and poses risks of erroneous enforcement actions based on flawed data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is characterized by significant concern over government surveillance, data privacy, and the potential for systemic abuse of power. Commenters expressed alarm that the integration of disparate data sources—specifically health records—into law enforcement databases creates a dangerous infrastructure with little accountability.

Key themes in the discussion included:
*   **Privacy and "Nothing to Hide" Arguments:** Several users cited the article as a rebuttal to the common argument that privacy is irrelevant to those with "nothing to hide." They highlighted scenarios where innocent individuals could be targeted due to data errors, "hallucinations" by AI systems, or malicious intent by bad actors within law enforcement.
*   **Infrastructure and Entrenchment:** There was a consensus that once built, these surveillance systems are difficult to dismantle. Users noted that such tools tend to expand their scope beyond initial justifications, making them permanent fixtures of state power regardless of political administration.
*   **Data Provenance and Scope:** A sub-thread debated the legality and logic of using Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. While some questioned the connection, others clarified that state-level programs sometimes cover immigrants or that data is used to track individuals regardless of specific immigration status, broadening the tool's target range.
*   **Federalism and Decentralization:** A distinct theme involved the debate over federal versus state power. One commenter argued that the "federal bloat" enabled by the erosion of the 10th Amendment created this centralized database risk, suggesting that decentralized, state-level social services would offer better protection against bad actors.
*   **Activism and Resistance:** The discussion concluded with calls for action, ranging from individual engineers refusing to work on such projects to more radical suggestions of "poisoning" datasets with bait entries or utilizing constitutional remedies.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 314 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source macOS application called "Posturr" that uses the webcam to detect a user's posture. If the user slouches—defined by a drop in head height—the app blurs the screen to provide a visual cue to sit up straight. The project is a single Swift file and is available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the app's privacy implications, technical implementation, and the broader ergonomics of desk work. Privacy was a major concern; several users expressed hesitation about running unaudited software with camera access, though others countered that the codebase is small and open-source, making it easy to review or have an AI audit.

Technical details sparked curiosity, particularly a "Claude Mode" notification mentioned in the README. The author clarified this was an experimental, abandoned feature where the app took screenshots for an AI to assess posture, which proved too slow and inaccurate compared to the current simple head-height detection. Commenters also debated the choice of a proprietary Apple tech stack versus open-source alternatives like Hugging Face models.

Beyond the app itself, the discussion shifted to general ergonomics. Users debated whether good posture is actually achievable or necessary for productivity, with some sharing their unconventional sitting positions. There was a consensus that using a laptop with proper posture is nearly impossible without external peripherals like a monitor stand or keyboard, and several commenters recommended specific hardware solutions like the Roost stand or Herman Miller chairs.

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes a technical implementation for adding a comment section to a static blog by leveraging the Bluesky social network. The author explains how to use Bluesky's API to fetch comments associated with a specific blog post (via a link or tag) and display them directly on the site. This approach allows bloggers to avoid managing a database or backend server for comments while utilizing an existing social infrastructure for discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to the technical implementation, with several users sharing similar projects or offering improvements. A recurring theme was the desire for static-site-friendly commenting solutions that avoid heavy third-party dependencies like Disqus. Users discussed alternative methods, such as using Cloudflare Workers to send comments directly to markdown files or automating the process via Git pull requests.

However, the discussion also sparked a debate regarding the long-term viability of relying on centralized social platforms for critical site features. While some viewed Bluesky as a convenient "growth hacking" tool, others expressed skepticism about for-profit networks inevitably declining (referencing Twitter/X). A moderator intervened to flag a shallow dismissal of Bluesky, reinforcing the guideline to provide substantive criticism. Ultimately, the conversation highlighted a tension between the convenience of using existing social APIs and the desire for decentralized, self-hosted, or fediverse-based commenting systems.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 237 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article argues that Europe is increasingly seeking "digital sovereignty" by reducing its heavy reliance on US internet technology and services. This push is driven by concerns over national security, economic dependency, and the political volatility of the United States. The author notes that while Europe has the economic scale to develop its own alternatives, it faces significant hurdles, including the entrenched dominance of American tech giants, the network effects that keep users locked in, and a historical lack of investment in homegrown digital infrastructure. The piece highlights ongoing efforts in some European cities to test resilience against digital blackouts and the development of local cloud and software alternatives, framing this as a necessary but challenging long-term project for Europe's strategic autonomy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a strong consensus that Europe should pursue digital independence from the US, but the conversation quickly splinters into debates over the feasibility, causes, and broader political context of this goal.

A dominant theme is the justification for this move. Many commenters argue that US tech giants have become "hegemonic, anti-human oligarchs" whose business models (surveillance capitalism, algorithmic radicalization) are detrimental to society. There's a belief that US political systems are fundamentally broken, with one user citing the influence of money in elections, making European alternatives more trustworthy for serving citizen interests rather than corporate ones. This sentiment is amplified by the political climate, with several users linking the need for independence to the actions of the Trump administration and a perceived decline in US reliability.

However, the discussion is tempered by widespread skepticism about Europe's ability to execute this vision. A recurring critique is that European bureaucracy is slow and ineffective, and that the continent's social and labor policies (e.g., shorter work weeks, generous leave) are seen by some as a hindrance to competing with the relentless pace of US and Chinese tech. The cultural mindset is also questioned, with one commenter describing a "defeatist attitude" in places like Holland, where employees and companies are resistant to moving away from convenient US products like Microsoft 365.

Practical challenges and the scale of the problem are also central. Commenters point out that the dependency isn't just on software but on foundational systems like operating systems, payment networks (Visa, Mastercard), and social media. While some argue that open-source software provides a ready-made foundation for sovereign tech, others are pessimistic, noting that network effects and inertia make it incredibly difficult to dislodge established US platforms. The discussion also touches on the role of external threats, with one user suggesting that Russia's cyber-attacks on Europe are ironically forcing it to harden its infrastructure, acting as a "Chaos Monkey" for the continent's digital resilience.

## [Poland's energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/)
**Score:** 278 | **Comments:** 134 | **ID:** 46747827

> **Article:** A new, never-before-seen wiper malware targeted Poland's energy grid in an attempt to disrupt communication between power generation and grid operators. The attack was unsuccessful and did not cause any power outages. The article notes that similar malware was used in a 2015 attack in Ukraine that left 230,000 people without electricity for six hours. The attack is linked to ongoing Russian cyberwarfare efforts against European infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on attributing the attack to Russia, with users citing Poland's critical role as a logistical hub for military aid to Ukraine as a clear motive. There was a consensus that such cyberattacks are an expected part of the ongoing hybrid war against Europe. Commenters debated the security of critical infrastructure, questioning how the attackers gained access, with speculation pointing towards compromised internet-connected systems or social engineering to bypass air-gapped networks, using Stuxnet as a historical example.

The conversation broadened to critique the European Union's response to Russian aggression. Many commenters expressed frustration, viewing the EU as weak, hypocritical, and divided, particularly criticizing France and Germany for prioritizing self-interest over collective security. Some argued that without greater sovereignty and coherent cooperation, Russia would continue to exploit these divisions. A separate thread questioned why similar cyberattacks on Russia's own grid are not reported, with speculation that Russia's older, less digitized infrastructure might make it a harder target. The discussion also touched on the severe economic consequences of such attacks, referencing the costly Jaguar hack, and the inadequacy of the current international response, which some feel fails to treat cyber-sabotage with the same gravity as physical warfare.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior Iranian health officials have claimed the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures, and the primary source cited is a German-Iranian eye doctor. This figure is significantly higher than previous estimates from groups like the Human Rights Activists News Agency, which had confirmed around 5,500 deaths and was investigating over 17,000 more.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is polarized, centering on skepticism regarding the source and magnitude of the 30,000 death toll figure. A significant portion of commenters express doubt, drawing parallels to historical instances of intelligence failures or manufactured consent for war, such as the WMD pretext for the Iraq War. They highlight the article's own admission that the figures are unverified and question the reliance on a single source.

Conversely, other users argue that the lack of independent reporting is a direct result of the Iranian government's severe internet shutdowns and information blackout. They contend that the absence of evidence is evidence of a cover-up, and that the high number is plausible given the regime's brutal crackdown. The discussion also branches into related topics: a technical debate on the effectiveness of modern internet censorship and the need for "offline-first" technology for activists, and a comparison of the protest death toll to historical events like the bombing of Dresden. The conversation is further fueled by emotional and political commentary, including calls for international intervention.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article from openDemocracy argues that Palantir, a US data analytics and surveillance technology company with deep ties to intelligence and military agencies, should be excluded from UK public services. The author, Zarah Sultana MP, contends that Palantir's business model and history are fundamentally incompatible with public service values, citing concerns over privacy, democratic accountability, and the company's controversial work with immigration enforcement and military clients. The piece frames the issue as a choice between outsourcing critical public functions to a secretive foreign corporation versus maintaining sovereign, ethical, and transparent public infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with commenters debating the specific issue of Palantir in the UK, the broader problem of US big tech in public services, and the political context of the article's author.

A significant portion of the conversation shifts from Palantir specifically to the wider ecosystem of US technology giants. Several users argue that companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple are equally or more dangerous due to their scale and integration into government infrastructure. The consensus is that reliance on any major US tech firm for critical public services poses a sovereignty risk, with some advocating for European alternatives and greater technological independence.

The discussion also touches on the broader political and social climate in the UK. Commenters express a sense of inevitability regarding the expansion of a "surveillance state," suggesting it has been gradually accepted by the public. There is cynicism about the effectiveness of political action, with some noting that protesting is becoming increasingly difficult and that electing representatives who prioritize public interest over corporate influence is a key challenge.

A notable sub-thread focuses on the character and statements of Palantir's CEO, Alex Karp, with commenters describing his ideology as concerning and his public pronouncements as alarming. This is used to underscore the perceived dangers of the company's ethos being embedded in public systems.

Finally, the discussion is punctuated by a meta-debate about the article's author, Zarah Sultana. One commenter attempts to discredit her by labeling her a "racist conspiracy theorist" and linking to an article about her attendance at a protest. This accusation is met with skepticism from other users, who advise taking such claims "with a grain of salt" and questioning the source's potential bias, highlighting the polarized nature of political discourse surrounding these issues.

## [Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 12 | **ID:** 46751826

> **Article:** The article "Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes" serves as a guide to the fundamentals of database indexing within PostgreSQL. It explains the purpose of indexes in speeding up data retrieval and details the different types available, such as B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN, and BRIN. The article covers practical implementation, including how to create and manage indexes, and discusses key considerations for effective indexing strategies, such as choosing the right columns and understanding the trade-offs between read performance and write overhead.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with commenters describing the article as "essential reading" and a good introduction. However, the discussion quickly evolved into a resource-sharing and technical clarification thread.

Multiple users highlighted the classic resource "Use the Index, Luke" as a go-to guide for B-tree indexes, mentioning it several times. The official PostgreSQL documentation was also recommended for its clarity.

A key technical discussion emerged around multi-column indexes. One user questioned if the article's advice was up-to-date, recalling instances where PostgreSQL could use an index even when querying only the lower-order columns of a composite index. A contributor clarified that while this was possible in older versions via inefficient full index scans, PostgreSQL 18 has now introduced proper "index skip scan" support, making this use case much more efficient. Another user noted that in such scenarios, a "bitmap index scan" might be used, which is less performant than a direct index scan.

Finally, the conversation branched into related topics. One user expressed a desire for built-in "incremental view maintenance" (IVM) in PostgreSQL, a feature that automatically updates materialized views. This prompted others to mention existing solutions, such as the `pg_ivm` extension, TimescaleDB's continuous aggregates, and various external streaming data systems like Materialize and Flink.

## [Postmortem: Our first VLEO satellite mission (with imagery and flight data)](https://albedo.com/post/clarity-1-what-worked-and-where-we-go-next)
**Score:** 215 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46747119

> **Article:** Albedo, a space technology startup, published a detailed postmortem of its first Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) satellite mission, Clarity-1. The mission aimed to demonstrate a VLEO platform to achieve higher-resolution Earth imagery than typical Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. The postmortem outlines the mission's successes, including the successful design and deployment of their custom satellite bus and the acquisition of high-quality imagery. However, the mission faced significant challenges. A primary failure involved the satellite's Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs), which locked up due to a lubricant incompatibility with operating temperatures, preventing the satellite from pointing and stabilizing as intended. Additionally, a proprietary TT&C (Telemetry, Tracking, and Command) radio experienced intermittent memory issues that eventually corrupted onboard memory, hindering recovery and reboot attempts. Despite these setbacks, the team successfully used the satellite's thrusters for stabilization and pointing, allowing them to capture valuable imagery and data. The article concludes with key learnings, emphasizing the need for deeper supply chain vetting, in-house development of critical components like radios, and more rigorous thermal testing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response was largely positive, with users congratulating the Albedo team on their transparency and the impressive technical achievement of a first mission. The discussion centered on several key technical and strategic points.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the root causes of the mission's failures. Users expressed curiosity about the lubricant issue in the CMGs, questioning why standard thermal vacuum testing didn't uncover the problem. The Albedo CEO confirmed the lesson was to "dig multiple levels deep in supply chain," acknowledging the resource constraints of a startup. Regarding the radio failure, the team explained that they had concerns about the supplier's NAND and ECC implementation and plan to build their own radios in the future to have better control over testing and diagnostics.

Technical inquiries were also prominent. A user asked about the physics of achieving 10cm resolution with a 1m optic at 250km, and another inquired about the geospatial accuracy of the imagery. An Albedo representative explained that geolocation accuracy was limited to 5-10 meters on this mission due to star tracker errors but is targeted to improve to 3-5 meters in future systems.

A notable sub-thread addressed the company's communication style. One commenter offered unsolicited advice, suggesting the "tech bro" tone of the blog post (using phrases like "nailed it") might be unappealing to the corporate and government clients Albedo likely needs to secure large contracts. They recommended a more professional tone to build trust. This critique was met with some pushback, with other users defending the style as appropriate for a company blog aimed at recruitment and community engagement.

Finally, the purpose of VLEO itself was discussed, with the CEO explaining its advantages for imaging, sensing, and communications due to the physics of proximity (inverse square and cube laws), as well as its potential for space resilience and debris mitigation.

## [Nvidia-smi hangs indefinitely after ~66 days](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/971)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46750425

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules repository where users report that `nvidia-smi` hangs indefinitely after approximately 66 days of system uptime. The issue appears to be specific to B200 GPUs using NVLink, with errors like "postRxDetLinkMask" appearing before the hang. A power cycle of the cluster temporarily resolves the problem, but the root cause remains unknown, and users are concerned about needing to wait another 66 days to test potential fixes.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on diagnosing the cause of the 66-day hang, with the most prominent theory being a 32-bit integer overflow in a counter related to NVLink or timekeeping, given that 66 days is close to 2^23 seconds. Users are analyzing the precise timing (66 days, 14 hours, 24 minutes) and suggesting that developers search for a power-of-two time unit in the code. There is also a notable side conversation about the ethics and effectiveness of using AI to draft bug report comments, sparked by one user's admission of doing so.

A significant portion of the discussion is anecdotal, with users sharing their own experiences with long-term uptime bugs. One user recounts a detailed, multi-layered troubleshooting saga with Raspberry Pi devices failing after a week due to a kernel USB driver bug, which required creative workarounds like controlled resets and watchdogs. Another user mentions a similar 31-day overflow bug in National Instruments' VISA driver. These stories highlight the common challenge of debugging issues with very long manifestation times and the ingenuity required to resolve them when standard fixes (like kernel upgrades) are not possible.

Finally, a technical suggestion was made to use the kernel's `time_before()` macro for timestamp comparisons to avoid overflow issues, and a user discovered an amusing coincidence: an internal NVIDIA bug number assigned to the issue matches the number of seconds in 66 days.

## [We X-Rayed a Suspicious FTDI USB Cable](https://eclypsium.com/blog/xray-counterfeit-usb-cable/)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46749053

> **Article:** The article from Eclypsium details a hardware analysis of a suspicious USB-A to USB-C cable suspected to be a counterfeit FTDI product. Using X-ray imaging, the authors compared the internal construction of the suspicious cable against a known genuine FTDI cable. The analysis revealed significant differences: the genuine cable utilized a single, integrated FTDI chip with associated passives, while the counterfeit cable used a "Frankenstein" assembly of multiple cheaper components, including a separate USB-C controller and a generic serial chip, to mimic the functionality. The authors concluded that the cable was a low-quality counterfeit designed to cut costs, highlighting the risks of supply chain compromises where inferior components may fail or behave unpredictably.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused primarily on the broader implications of hardware trust, supply chain security, and the reputation of FTDI. While some commenters analyzed the technical details of the X-ray images—debating which component layout looked cheaper or more authentic—the conversation quickly pivoted to the security risks of "black box" hardware.

A major theme was the feasibility of persistent, low-level malware. One user detailed a personal project to perform a supply chain attack by replacing a motherboard's PCH chip with an "unfused" Intel chip sourced from Aliexpress to bypass security features like Boot Guard. Other users suggested alternative attack vectors, such as compromising the firmware of NICs, BMCs, or SSDs, or utilizing the Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) to persist malware through BIOS/UEFI reflashing.

There was also significant discussion regarding FTDI's corporate reputation. Many users noted that FTDI has historically bricked counterfeit chips via driver updates, which has eroded trust in the brand and driven consumers toward alternative manufacturers like CH340. Commenters acknowledged that while the article served as marketing for Eclypsium, it was relevant and interesting, effectively illustrating the dangers of opaque hardware supply chains where malicious or substandard components can easily masquerade as legitimate ones.

**Score:** 180 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46749671

> **Article:** The article "Two Weeks Until Tapeout" is a personal blog post detailing the author's experience designing a JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) TAP (Test Access Port) controller for an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). The author participated in the Tiny Tapeout project, which offers free shuttles for chip fabrication using GlobalFoundries' 180nm process. A key challenge highlighted is the inaccessibility of the official IEEE JTAG specification due to its paywall, forcing the author to rely on alternative resources for verification. The post chronicles the intense, two-week design sprint, covering the entire workflow from RTL design and simulation to physical layout and final submission, emphasizing the practical hurdles and learning curve involved in creating a functional piece of silicon.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters praising the article's engaging writing style and its value in demystifying the complex world of chip design. A central theme was the contrast between the author's niche hardware project and the more common focus on web development on the platform, with many appreciating the reminder of the vastness of the tech world.

Several key topics emerged:
*   **Open-Source EDA Tools:** A significant point of discussion was the accessibility of chip design tools. Commenters confirmed that it's entirely possible to complete a project like this using free and open-source software, a trend that is growing thanks to initiatives like OpenROAD and open PDKs, particularly in academic settings.
*   **Industry vs. Hobbyist Experience:** A professional with decades of experience in physical design shared the immense pressure of commercial tapeouts, noting that fixed shuttle dates (like in the article) add a layer of stress not always present in company-controlled projects. This led to a sub-discussion on the parallels with stressful deadlines in software development (e.g., app store reviews).
*   **Technical Curiosities:** The conversation also toucheded on specific technical points, such as the necessity of SRAM for commercially viable designs and the practicalities of post-fabrication bug fixes using new metal layer masks.
*   **Community Engagement:** The author of the article, "random_duck," was an active participant in the comments, answering questions and engaging with the community, which enriched the discussion.

Overall, the community reacted with admiration for the author's project, using it as a springboard to discuss the state of open-source hardware tools and share experiences from the professional world of chip design.

## [Show HN: Bonsplit – Tabs and splits for native macOS apps](https://bonsplit.alasdairmonk.com)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 20 | **ID:** 46753301

> **Project:** Bonsplit is a native macOS library for developers that adds tabbed and split-pane interfaces to applications built with AppKit or SwiftUI. It provides a polished, high-fidelity UI component that mimics the behavior seen in code editors like Sublime Text, allowing apps to manage multiple views within a single window. The project is accompanied by a highly polished, custom-designed website that serves as its documentation and demo.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to Bonsplit was largely positive, with commenters praising the library's visual polish and the quality of its website. However, the discussion revealed some initial confusion regarding the project's scope. Several users mistakenly believed it was a system-wide utility that would add tabs to all native macOS apps, rather than a library for developers to integrate into their own applications. Once clarified, developers appreciated the utility, though one commenter noted that Apple's native AppKit APIs already offer window-level tabbing, questioning the specific need for this library. The conversation also highlighted the exceptional quality of the project's website, with users debating whether its elaborate design was for professional showcasing or simply "for the love of the game."

## [Alex Honnold completes Taipei 101 skyscraper climb without ropes or safety net](https://www.cnn.com/sport/live-news/taiwan-alex-honnold-climb-taipei-101-01-25-26-intl-hnk)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46750470

> **Article:** CNN reports that Alex Honnold, the renowned rock climber, successfully free-soloed Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest skyscrapers. The article covers the event, which was broadcast live on Netflix, detailing Honnold's ascent of the 1,667-foot structure without ropes or safety equipment. The climb took place in Taiwan and drew significant public and media attention.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mixture of awe, concern, and practical analysis. The dominant sentiment was admiration for Honnold's incredible physical and mental feat, with many commenters comparing the spectacle to other extreme human achievements like Felix Baumgartner's space jump. Several users who watched the live stream shared their personal experiences, noting the tension and excitement of witnessing the climb in person or via broadcast.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the motivations behind such a dangerous act. While some viewed it as a purely selfish risk, particularly given that Honnold has a family, others argued it was a calculated professional endeavor. It was suggested that the climb was a lucrative opportunity for Honnold, whose unique skill set is in high demand, and that the controlled environment of a skyscraper with cameras might be less technically demanding than a natural rock face like El Capitan.

The quality of the live broadcast was also a point of contention. Several commenters criticized the Netflix commentary as unbearable and distracting, preferring the more subdued Taiwanese news feeds which allowed viewers to experience the tension of the climb more directly. Finally, the discussion broadened to include historical context, with users referencing other famous climbs like Philippe Petit's tightrope walk between the Twin Towers and a technical ascent of the Sydney Tower, highlighting the different challenges and equipment involved in tower climbing.
