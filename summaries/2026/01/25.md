## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 432 | **Comments:** 278 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** The article announces that BirdyChat has become the first third-party chat application to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (EEA). This integration is a direct result of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which mandates that gatekeepers like Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) open their services to competitors. The feature allows BirdyChat users to send and receive messages to and from WhatsApp users within the region, bridging the gap between the two platforms. The announcement positions BirdyChat as a pioneer in the new regulatory landscape, offering an alternative for users who wish to use a different app without losing contact with their WhatsApp network.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is largely skeptical and critical, focusing on the implementation details, the nature of the companies involved, and the broader context of open versus closed communication protocols.

A central point of contention is the opt-in nature of the feature for WhatsApp users. Commenters argue that this requirement significantly weakens the impact, as a WhatsApp user must manually enable interoperability for each third-party app, making it a difficult hurdle to overcome in practice. This leads to speculation that Meta is engaging in "malicious compliance" with the DMA. Several users pointed out that BirdyChat and another interoperable app, Haiket, appear to be small, unknown startups, with Haiket having direct patent ties to Meta. This fueled suspicion that Meta has hand-picked compliant, non-threatening partners to create the illusion of openness while making it difficult for genuine competitors to gain traction.

The conversation also broadened to a classic debate on open versus proprietary protocols. Many commenters expressed a nostalgic preference for open standards like IRC and XMPP, lamenting the dominance of walled gardens. However, a counterpoint was made that users have consistently chosen the superior features and user experience of closed platforms over the principles of open standards.

Finally, there was discussion about the potential ripple effects, with some hoping this would force Apple to open up iMessage. This was quickly tempered by the clarification that iMessage was not designated a "gatekeeper" under the current DMA rules and is thus exempt from such requirements. Other minor threads touched on the app's name, the mechanics of end-to-end encryption in this new model, and a brief, dismissive exchange about "vibecoding."

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes a technical implementation for adding a comment section to a static blog using Bluesky (a decentralized social network). The author explains how they embed a Bluesky "widget" or utilize Bluesky's API to display comments associated with a specific blog post, effectively using the social network as a comment hosting platform. The solution allows for static site generation while leveraging an external service for user interaction and moderation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded with generally positive interest, though the discussion quickly expanded into broader debates about comment system architectures and the longevity of social platforms.

Several users shared their own implementations. One user mentioned using a Cloudflare Worker script to send comments directly to their blog's markdown files, while another discussed a system that automates comment moderation via GitHub Pull Requests. There was also a mention of a project using Bluesky and Mastodon to add posts to a map, highlighting the versatility of using social protocols for web features.

The conversation also touched on the philosophy of relying on third-party platforms. While some viewed this as a clever "growth hack" for Bluesky, others expressed skepticism about the longevity of for-profit social networks, drawing parallels to Twitter's history. A moderator intervened to remind a user that shallow dismissals of the work were not constructive.

Finally, a detailed critique of existing comment solutions emerged from a user comparing Disqus to alternatives like Giscus. They outlined specific requirements for technical tutorials—such as robust code block support, image hosting, and spam management—concluding that while existing solutions have flaws, they often meet a wider range of needs than decentralized alternatives currently do.

## [Tao Te Ching – Translated by Ursula K. Le Guin](https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46745233

> **Article:** The article is a link to a GitHub repository containing Ursula K. Le Guin's "rendition" of the Tao Te Ching. Le Guin explicitly states in the text that this is not a direct translation, as she does not know Chinese. Instead, she based her work on Paul Carus's 1898 translation, which provided Chinese characters with transliterations and definitions, allowing her to create a poetic interpretation of the ancient text.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community engaged with the post through several distinct themes. A primary focus was on the nature of translation and interpretation. Users debated the validity of Le Guin's approach, with some noting that even direct translations are fraught with difficulty due to the Tao Te Ching's ambiguity and cultural context. One commenter likened different translations to musical "cover songs," arguing that each offers a unique perspective on the original work. There was also a minor ethical debate regarding the copyright status of Le Guin's rendition, with some users concerned about it being hosted on GitHub while others defended it as a legitimate interpretation of a public domain text.

Beyond the text itself, the discussion highlighted the HN community's affinity for the Tao Te Ching, with a moderator linking to several previous popular discussions on the topic. Commenters also connected the text's themes to broader cultural and personal experiences, such as its contrast with American self-assertion, its influence on Le Guin's fiction (specifically the *Earthsea* series), and its resonance with engineering culture. Finally, a user humorously critiqued the community's tendency to upvote and downvote comments as an "affront to the Dao."

## [Federal Agents Kill Another Person in Minneapolis Immigration Crackdown](https://time.com/7357547/minneapolis-shooting-ice-agent/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46745944

> **Article:** A federal law enforcement officer, identified as an ICE agent, shot and killed a man in Minneapolis during an immigration enforcement operation. The incident occurred when officers attempted to stop a vehicle, and the driver allegedly struck an officer with the car. The officer then fired, killing the driver. The shooting is under investigation by the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The article notes that this is the second fatal shooting by federal agents during immigration operations in the area within a short period, following a similar incident in July.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was largely moved to a previous thread covering the same topic, but the comments present on the linked post focused on several key themes. Many commenters expressed skepticism toward the official narrative provided by federal agents, drawing parallels to other controversial police shootings where initial accounts were later revised. There was significant debate over the use of lethal force in immigration enforcement operations, with users questioning the proportionality of the response to a vehicle allegedly striking an officer. Several participants discussed the broader context of increased federal immigration enforcement tactics and their consequences, while others debated the legal standards for use of force by law enforcement. The conversation also touched on the reliability of government statements versus eyewitness accounts, and the difficulty of obtaining unbiased information in politically charged incidents.

## [I Like GitLab](https://www.whileforloop.com/en/blog/2026/01/21/i-like-gitlab/)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46742432

> **Article:** The article "I Like GitLab" is a personal endorsement of GitLab as a comprehensive, all-in-one platform for software development. The author appreciates its unified interface that integrates source code management, CI/CD, issue tracking, and other features, which simplifies workflows compared to using disparate tools. The piece highlights the platform's reliability and smooth experience, especially with recent updates like the migration to a Single Page Application (SPA) which has improved performance. It also touches on the benefit of self-hosting, giving companies full control over their data and infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a balanced view of GitLab, with commenters weighing its all-in-one feature set against its significant resource consumption and performance issues. A central theme is the trade-off between convenience and efficiency.

Many users praise GitLab's integrated approach, particularly its CI/CD system, which is widely seen as superior to alternatives like Jenkins. The ability to self-host is also a major advantage for companies that need control over their infrastructure and data, with some noting that even AI features can be self-hosted. The platform is considered a solid, reliable choice for professional team environments.

However, a significant portion of the discussion focuses on GitLab's drawbacks, primarily its high resource usage and slow performance. Several commenters, including those who use GitLab at work, have switched to lighter-weight, self-hosted alternatives like Forgejo and Gitea for personal projects. These forks, written in Go, are praised for being much faster, more resource-efficient, and easier to set up and maintain on a VPS. The debate between Gitea and Forgejo was also touched upon, with some users preferring Forgejo's community-driven development model.

Other criticisms included GitLab's complex and sometimes stagnant feature development, a common user experience of running into long-standing, unresolved bugs, and the frustration of paywalls for essential features like mandatory reviews in the free tier. Despite these issues, many conceded that for a professional team needing a comprehensive, integrated solution, GitLab remains a strong and capable platform.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article argues that Europe is increasingly seeking "digital sovereignty" by reducing its reliance on US internet technology and platforms. This push is driven by several factors: the growing awareness of geopolitical risks (such as US policy shifts or potential service denials), concerns over data privacy under US laws, and the economic dominance of American tech giants. The piece highlights that this isn't just about data, but about fundamental infrastructure—from cloud services and operating systems to payment networks. It cites examples like the city of Helsingborg testing how public services would function during a digital blackout to underscore the urgency. The ultimate goal is for Europe to foster its own tech ecosystem to ensure security, economic independence, and the ability to set its own rules without being subject to the whims of US corporations or government policy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely supportive of Europe's goal to reduce reliance on US tech, viewing it as a necessary and "sane" move for geopolitical and economic security. However, the comments express significant skepticism about Europe's ability to execute this vision.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Motivation and Justification:** Many agree that the move is essential due to the "hegemonic, anti-human" nature of US tech oligarchs and the fact that US policy is driven by billionaire interests rather than citizen welfare. The instability of US politics (referenced as "MAGA") is seen as a long-term risk, making alternatives a prudent necessity for everyone, including Americans.
*   **Skepticism of Execution:** A recurring sentiment is that Europe is too bureaucratic and slow to act effectively. There is a fear that by the time viable European alternatives are developed, the political landscape will have shifted, or US tech giants will have lobbied to install favorable right-wing governments.
*   **Economic and Cultural Barriers:** A significant point of contention is whether Europe's economic model can compete. One commenter argues that "socialist" policies like short work weeks and extensive leave prevent European tech from keeping pace with the US and China. Others counter this, suggesting the problem is more about corporate inertia and the perceived difficulty of migrating from entrenched systems like Microsoft 365 and Active Directory.
*   **Practicality and Scope:** Commenters note that the challenge is immense, extending beyond software to payment systems (Visa/Mastercard) and hardware. While open-source software is presented as a potential foundation for "sovereign" tech, the consensus is that overcoming the network effects and convenience of established US products is a monumental task that requires more than just small-scale experiments.

## [Adoption of EVs tied to real-world reductions in air pollution: study](https://keck.usc.edu/news/adoption-of-electric-vehicles-tied-to-real-world-reductions-in-air-pollution-study-finds/)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46749198

> **Article:** A study from USC Keck analyzed air quality data in California neighborhoods from 2019 to 2023. By correlating the number of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) registered in each area with satellite-measured nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels, researchers found that for every 200 new ZEVs added, NO₂ levels dropped by 1.1%. The study concludes that the adoption of electric vehicles is directly tied to real-world reductions in local air pollution.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely supported the study's findings, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes about the negative impacts of diesel and gasoline exhaust, such as foul odors and visible soot. A key theme was the tangible benefit of moving pollution sources away from populated areas to power plants, which allows for more centralized and effective filtration. Several users shared observations from international travel, noting that cities with high EV adoption, like Shanghai, feel significantly quieter and cleaner than those reliant on internal combustion engines (ICE).

However, the conversation also introduced several counterpoints and complexities. Some commenters raised concerns about the weight of EVs causing faster road degradation and the environmental impact of lithium mining, though others countered that the pollution from fossil fuels is far greater and that modern EVs are not significantly heavier than their ICE counterparts. The discussion also touched on non-exhaust pollution sources like tire and brake particulates, with a clarification that the specific study focused on NO₂, which is primarily an exhaust-related pollutant. Finally, a few users debated the practicality of EV truck adoption, citing the need for better battery capacity and charging infrastructure, and one commenter expressed a desire for "dumb" EVs without smart-car features.

## [Poland's energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46747827

> **Article:** A new, never-before-seen wiper malware was used in a cyberattack targeting Poland's energy grid. The attack was ultimately unsuccessful and did not cause any power outages. The malware is believed to be the work of a Russian state-sponsored hacking group, and the attack is seen as part of the ongoing cyber warfare between Russia and Europe, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Poland is a key logistical hub for aid to Ukraine, making its infrastructure a prime target. The article contrasts this failed attack with a successful 2015 attack in Ukraine that left 230,000 people without power.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focuses on attributing the attack and understanding its geopolitical context. The consensus among commenters is that Russia is the likely perpetrator, with one user stating that Russia is "at war with Europe" and another noting that Poland's role as a logistical hub for Ukraine makes it a predictable target for infrastructure attacks. A key point raised is that while the attack failed, it provides valuable intelligence for defenders, as it exposes Russian cyberwarfare techniques and burns valuable exploits.

The conversation also touches on the potential damage, with a user referencing the successful 2015 attack in Ukraine to illustrate the real-world impact such malware can have. One commenter injects a more cynical and conspiratorial tone, questioning whether the US could also be responsible, while another user humorously misinterprets "wiper malware" as internet-connected car windshield wipers before realizing the actual context of the cyberattack.

## [Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46742635

> **Article:** The article "Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite" argues that for an embedded database, executing numerous small, separate SELECT queries can be more performant than crafting a single, complex query to retrieve the same data. The author (likely D. Richard Hipp, creator of SQLite) demonstrates this using the Fossil SCM's timeline feature as a case study. The core reasoning is that the overhead of a single complex query—such as parsing, planning, and processing intricate JOINs—can exceed the cumulative cost of many simple, direct lookups, especially when the data is indexed and the database is local. The article posits that the traditional "minimize database round-trips" optimization rule, designed for client-server databases over a network, does not apply to an embedded engine where the "round-trip" is a direct function call.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds crucial context, primarily focusing on the distinction between embedded and networked databases. The central theme is that the performance benefit of many small queries in SQLite stems from the elimination of network and inter-process communication (IPC) overhead. Commenters explain that even a localhost connection to a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL involves significant system call and network stack latency, which is absent in SQLite's direct file system access.

While the article's logic is generally accepted, several commenters introduce important caveats and counterpoints. One key distinction is made between OLTP-style record retrievals (where many small queries are fine) and analytic queries (where a single, complex query allows the query optimizer to perform more significant optimizations). The discussion also highlights practical limitations of SQLite, particularly its write concurrency model. A user noted that even with low traffic, concurrent writes from background workers (e.g., Celery) can cause contention and force a migration to a server-based database like Postgres.

The conversation also touched on architectural patterns. Some users advocate for using SQLite as a scalable "application file format" or for customer-level sharding in distributed systems (like Cloudflare D1), where cross-customer analytics are slow but individual performance is excellent. There was a consensus that for the vast majority of applications, the scalability limits of SQLite are rarely hit, and the simplicity of an embedded database is a significant advantage. Finally, a few commenters expressed a desire for concrete benchmarks to quantify the performance difference between SQLite and a local server-based database, acknowledging that while the principle is sound, the magnitude of the speedup is a point of interest.

## [Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46744807

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asked if others are experiencing issues with Gmail's spam filter suddenly and aggressively marking legitimate emails (such as from USPS, HR, and system notifications) as spam or suspicious. They are seeking confirmation from the community and potential explanations for the change in behavior.
>
> **Discussion:** The community largely confirmed the user's experience, describing a noticeable degradation in Gmail's filtering accuracy. Key discussion points included:

*   **Aggressive Flagging of Legitimate Mail:** Multiple users reported that legitimate emails, including official communications from the USPS and internal HR messages, are being incorrectly flagged as "suspicious" or "possibly unsafe." A common message displayed to users is that "Gmail hasn't scanned this message," suggesting a potential issue with Google's scanning infrastructure.
*   **Category Misclassification:** Beyond spam, users noted that emails are being incorrectly sorted into the "Promotions" tab when they belong in "Primary," and that important emails are being marked as "unimportant," ignoring user-defined priority rules.
*   **Performance and Reliability Issues:** The problems appear to be part of a broader service degradation. Users reported significant delays in email delivery (up to 7-10 minutes), which makes Gmail unreliable for time-sensitive tasks like two-factor authentication (2FA) and password resets. This slowness is also causing users to disable notifications on their devices.
*   **Spam Infiltration:** Conversely, some users observed an increase in obvious spam and scam emails (e.g., 419 scams) appearing directly in their Primary inbox, a rare occurrence for Gmail's typically robust filter.
*   **Proposed Solutions and Explanations:** A user explained that Gmail's filters are crowd-sourced, advising others to manually mark misclassified emails as "not spam" to help retrain the system. However, the consensus was that the issue is on Google's end and that user-side fixes are limited.
*   **Broader Context:** The discussion touched on general email hygiene, with one user noting that the only way to guarantee zero spam is to never disclose an email address. However, the core issue was identified as a recent, systemic failure in Gmail's filtering algorithms or infrastructure.

## [Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison](https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46745922

> **Article:** The article "Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison" benchmarks the processing speed of all five generations of Raspberry Pi. The test involves rendering a 1080p H.264 video, measuring the time taken to complete the task. The results show a massive performance leap with each generation, culminating in the Raspberry Pi 5 being over 600 times faster than the original Pi 1. The article also includes power consumption measurements, noting that newer models draw significantly more power, especially under load.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community that is nostalgic about the Raspberry Pi's history but also critical of its recent direction. A central theme is the debate over whether the Pi's increasing raw performance is worth the associated trade-offs. Several users argue that the Pi 3 represents a "sweet spot," offering sufficient power for many tasks (like home servers or retro gaming) while being more power-efficient and having fewer hardware headaches—such as demanding power requirements and thermal management—than the Pi 4 and 5.

There is also significant technical critique of the article's methodology. Commenters point out that using a modern software-based H.264 video decode as a benchmark is misleading, as the original Pi 1 was specifically designed with fixed-function hardware for this exact task and would perform far better with a proper setup. This leads to a broader discussion about the Pi's architecture, with some noting the GPU (VideoCore) is the true "brain" of the device, especially in early models.

Other key points include:
*   **Longevity and Use Cases:** Users celebrate the Pi's ability to give old hardware a new life, with several sharing examples of Pi 1s and 2s still running reliably for low-bandwidth tasks like DNS servers, print servers, or network exit nodes.
*   **Alternative Solutions:** A recurring suggestion is that for non-GPIO-dependent tasks, a used mini-PC offers vastly superior performance and compatibility for a similar price, albeit with higher power consumption.
*   **Community Sentiment:** There's a shared frustration with the Pi Foundation's historical attitude towards demanding use cases (like thermal throttling under heavy load), summed up by a quoted forum response: "why would anyone ever want to do that."
*   **Practical Issues:** The difficulty of accessing the original article due to a "cookie wall" and the "hug of death" were also noted.

## [Postmortem: Our first VLEO satellite mission (with imagery and flight data)](https://albedo.com/post/clarity-1-what-worked-and-where-we-go-next)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46747119

> **Article:** Albedo, a space technology startup, published a detailed postmortem of its first Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) satellite mission, Clarity-1. The mission aimed to demonstrate high-resolution Earth imaging from an orbit of approximately 250km. The write-up covers the mission's architecture, what worked (including successful deployment, initial imaging, and custom spacecraft bus performance), and what broke. Key failures included the loss of Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) due to a lubricant issue incompatible with operating temperatures, and a persistent memory corruption issue in a third-party radio that eventually led to a loss of command capability. The team shared imagery and flight data, highlighting the mission's successes despite the challenges and outlining key engineering and supply chain learnings for future missions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with users congratulating the Albedo team on their ambitious and relatively successful first mission. The conversation centered on several key themes:

Technical inquiries and clarifications were prevalent. Users asked about the software stack, the physics behind achieving 10cm resolution, and the impact of geolocation accuracy. An Albedo representative explained that their initial geolocation error was around 5-10 meters due to star tracker limitations, with a goal of reaching 3-5 meters in future missions without ground control points. They also confirmed plans to develop their own radios in-house to better control and debug issues like the memory corruption that plagued their first mission.

A significant point of discussion was the postmortem's root cause analysis. One commenter pointed to the lubricant failure in the CMGs as a clear example of a supply chain issue, and the CEO acknowledged the difficulty of vetting suppliers as a startup. Another user questioned the logic behind delaying the jettison of the telescope's contamination cover, which was clarified as a space safety measure to ensure the cover would de-orbit quickly.

A notable critique emerged regarding the writing style. One commenter argued that the informal, "tech bro" tone (using phrases like "nailed it") could be unappealing to the established, corporate clients in the space industry. They advised the company to adopt a more professional tone to secure lucrative contracts. This sparked a minor debate, with other users defending the style as appropriate for a company blog aimed at recruiting and building a public profile.

Finally, the purpose of VLEO itself was briefly touched upon, with an Albedo representative explaining the physics benefits for imaging, sensing, and communications, as well as its strategic advantages for debris mitigation and survivability.
