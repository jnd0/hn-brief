# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-25

## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 582 | **Comments:** 350 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** The article announces that BirdyChat has become the first European chat application to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp, enabled by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This allows BirdyChat users in the European Economic Area (EEA) to communicate with WhatsApp users in the region using only a phone number. The integration utilizes a new interface mandated by the DMA, which requires designated "gatekeeper" platforms like WhatsApp to open their services to third-party providers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a mix of skepticism, historical context, and regulatory analysis regarding BirdyChat's interoperability with WhatsApp. A central theme is the skepticism toward the implementation's effectiveness. Several users point out that WhatsApp's interoperability is opt-in for existing users, which many believe will severely limit adoption and render the feature "dead in the water." There is also significant suspicion that BirdyChat and another interoperable app, Haiket, are not genuine competitors but rather "malicious compliance" products hand-picked by Meta to create the appearance of openness without facilitating real competition. Evidence cited includes the apps' obscurity, waitlist-based models, and Haiket CEO's patent assignments to Meta.

Broader discussions about open versus proprietary protocols also feature prominently. One commenter laments the decline of open standards like IRC and XMPP in favor of closed ecosystems, while another counters that users have consistently chosen the superior features and user experience of proprietary apps over the principles of open standards.

Regarding the regulatory landscape, users debate the impact on other platforms. While some hope this will pressure Apple to open iMessage, others note that iMessage was not designated a "gatekeeper" under the DMA and is therefore exempt from such requirements. A technical point was raised that iMessage is already interoperable via SMS, though this was countered by WhatsApp's design choice to exclude SMS for security reasons. Finally, users inquired about the technical implications for end-to-end encryption and the geographic scope of the interoperability, with the consensus being that it is currently limited to the EEA.

## [Man shot and killed by federal agents in south Minneapolis this morning](https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426)
**Score:** 575 | **Comments:** 617 | **ID:** 46745047

> **Article:** The Star Tribune article reports that a man was shot and killed by federal agents during an immigration enforcement operation in south Minneapolis. The incident occurred near a donut shop, and the article notes that the FBI and DHS are investigating. The post on Hacker News links to this news report and includes user-provided links to videos of the incident on Reddit.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the federal agents' actions, with many commenters describing the event as an execution or murder. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **Interpretation of the Video:** While official reports state the individual was armed, commenters analyzing linked videos argue the victim was pinned to the ground by multiple agents before being shot. They describe the incident as a "summary execution" and compare the agents' behavior to that of "brownshirts."
*   **Political and Social Context:** Users connect the shooting to the Trump administration's policies, specifically targeting the Somali community in Minnesota. Commenters suggest the location was chosen to incite conflict and that ICE agents are being recruited from white nationalist circles. A quote from Garry Kasparov is shared, framing the violence as a deliberate strategy to create chaos and justify authoritarian crackdowns.
*   **Federal vs. State Power:** A thread discusses the legal and practical ability of Minnesota or Minneapolis to resist or expel ICE agents. The consensus is that while states have some jurisdiction, the federal government holds significant power, and any direct confrontation would be legally and politically complex.
*   **Censorship and Platform Governance:** Several users express frustration that the article was quickly flagged and removed from the Hacker News homepage, viewing it as an act of censorship. This led to discussions about using the "/active" page to see all posts and general skepticism about the site's moderation.
*   **Calls to Action:** One user suggests that Congress should leverage the upcoming DHS funding bill to impose restrictions on ICE, such as mandating state-level investigations into misconduct. However, another user counters that funding is likely to pass regardless, citing the timing of the shooting alongside a funding increase as evidence of systemic failure.

## [Microsoft will give the FBI a Windows PC data encryption key if ordered](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-bitlocker-encryption-keys-give-fbi-legal-order-privacy-nightmare)
**Score:** 512 | **Comments:** 304 | **ID:** 46743154

> **Article:** An article from Windows Central reports that Microsoft will provide the FBI with a user's BitLocker encryption key if presented with a valid legal order. The article highlights that this is possible because Microsoft backs up BitLocker recovery keys to a user's Microsoft account by default, which are stored in plaintext on their servers. This practice is presented as a "privacy nightmare" that undermines the security promises of full-disk encryption, as the data is not end-to-end encrypted and is accessible to Microsoft and, by extension, law enforcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a multifaceted debate about user privacy, corporate responsibility, and the effectiveness of modern encryption. A central theme is the surprise—or lack thereof—among commenters. While some express dismay that Microsoft stores BitLocker keys in a recoverable format, others argue this has been standard practice for major tech companies for years and that users should not expect true privacy from corporations that are subject to legal jurisdiction. The conversation frequently contrasts Microsoft's approach with alternatives, particularly Linux, where full-disk encryption keys are typically not backed up by default, and third-party tools like VeraCrypt, which offer more user-controlled security.

The discussion also expands to compare other major platforms. Users debate Apple's security posture, with some claiming iCloud backups create similar vulnerabilities, while others defend Apple's end-to-end encryption for certain data types and its history of resisting law enforcement requests, such as the San Bernardino iPhone case. The debate touches on the trade-off between convenience and security, with many commenters suggesting that the only way to guarantee privacy is to use open-source, self-hosted, or non-corporate solutions that do not hold user keys. Ultimately, the consensus leans towards user education and taking personal responsibility for securing one's own encryption keys rather than trusting a third party.

## [How I estimate work](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/)
**Score:** 473 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46742389

> **Article:** The article "How I Estimate Work" by Sean Goedecke presents a pragmatic approach to software estimation, arguing that engineers should embrace estimation as a core part of their job rather than resisting it. The author's method involves first understanding the business's desired timeline (the "range my manager is looking for") and then working backward to identify a technical solution that fits within that constraint. He contrasts this with the common engineer preference for first designing an "ideal" solution and then estimating its cost, which often leads to conflict. Goedecke frames estimation not as a precise prediction but as a negotiation and a tool for managing scope, emphasizing that if engineers refuse to estimate, non-technical stakeholders will do it for them, often with worse results.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing war stories and reinforcing the idea that estimation is a political and communicative skill as much as a technical one. A dominant theme is the inherent inaccuracy of software estimates, illustrated by humorous but cynical advice from the past, such as multiplying initial estimates by pi (3.14) or repeatedly doubling the detailed estimate. Several commenters share the "10 lines of code per day" rule as a rough, pessimistic heuristic.

A key point of debate revolves around the *purpose* of estimation. One side, echoing the article, sees it as a necessary tool for collaboration and managing business expectations. The other side, articulated by commenters like `bgribble` and `pocketarc`, frames it as a political necessity driven by sales cycles. They argue that sales teams need a date to close deals, and providing an estimate, however flawed, is better for the business than saying "we don't know." This leads to a recurring tension where business needs for certainty clash with engineering reality.

Practical strategies were also shared. The "tracer-bullet" approach (building a thin, end-to-end proof-of-concept first) was suggested as a way to reduce unknown unknowns before making a more solid estimate. The discussion also touched on the importance of following up on past estimates to improve accuracy over time. The absence of LLMs in the original article was noted as a positive, with a cynical aside that some might pretend they speed up development to please management. Ultimately, the consensus was that estimation is an imperfect but essential art, and engineers are better off engaging with the process proactively.

## [Doing gigabit Ethernet over my British phone wires](https://thehftguy.com/2026/01/22/doing-gigabit-ethernet-over-my-british-phone-wires/)
**Score:** 450 | **Comments:** 260 | **ID:** 46742362

> **Article:** The author documents their successful experiment to achieve gigabit Ethernet speeds (940 Mbps) over existing British telephone wiring (twisted pair) within their home. Faced with the inability to run new cables and lacking gigabit ports on some devices, they used G.hn (a modern HomePlug-style standard) adapters. The article details the setup process, the surprisingly high performance achieved despite challenging wiring with many bridge taps (unused sockets), and a critique of UK internet providers who, in the author's experience, do not offer true gigabit fiber connections. It also touches on the logistical difficulties of importing these adapters from Europe due to post-Brexit customs procedures.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the technical feasibility of the project, the state of UK broadband, and practical networking alternatives. Commenters largely agree that the result is impressive but debate the practicality of the solution.

Technically, users with experience in G.hn and DSL technologies discuss how the adapters manage to achieve such high speeds on noisy lines. They explain that G.hn uses OFDM to map the channel and avoid frequencies affected by signal reflections from bridge taps, similar to how VDSL2 works but at higher frequencies. A user provided a screenshot of the frequency response, showing the system dynamically adapting to the line conditions.

Regarding UK internet infrastructure, there is pushback against the author's claim that gigabit internet isn't truly available. Several commenters noted having full-duplex gigabit fiber in London since as early as 2016, suggesting the author's experience might be limited to specific areas or older infrastructure (like HFC or xDSL).

Practical alternatives were a major theme. Many users shared their own experiences running new cables (Cat5e/Cat6) through walls, often using old phone wires as pull strings. While effective, this is acknowledged as a labor-intensive task. Others discussed the viability of Wi-Fi 7, which can now exceed gigabit speeds in real-world conditions, though concerns about latency and stability for gaming remain. The viability of using existing coaxial cables (MoCA) was also mentioned, though some noted higher latency compared to Ethernet. Finally, there was a brief debate on the market viability of G.hn adapters, with some believing the market is small because technical users prefer pulling their own cables.

## [Claude Code's new hidden feature: Swarms](https://twitter.com/NicerInPerson/status/2014989679796347375)
**Score:** 406 | **Comments:** 278 | **ID:** 46743908

> **Article:** The article links to a social media post revealing a "hidden" feature in Anthropic's Claude Code CLI called "Swarms." This feature enables an agentic workflow where a primary "team lead" agent can delegate tasks to multiple sub-agents (workers) to work in parallel on different aspects of a codebase. The feature is reportedly present in the latest builds but is gated behind a server-side feature flag. The post links to a GitHub repository demonstrating how to bypass this check by patching the local CLI installation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the technical implementation of the feature, its comparison to existing tools, and significant security concerns raised by a related project.

Users quickly identified how to enable the feature: by patching the local CLI code to bypass the server-side feature flag check. Commenters compared this capability to existing third-party tools like "claude-flow" and "GSD," noting that while the concept isn't new, the native integration into the Claude Code harness offers tighter control, such as managing context drift and delegation modes.

A major point of concern was raised regarding the "claude-flow" project mentioned in the comparison. A user highlighted alarming telemetry practices in that project, alleging it captures and exports sensitive user data—including conversation histories, API keys, and source code—to potentially attacker-controlled endpoints, compromising various AI coding assistant configurations.

There was also a debate on the utility and efficiency of swarm architectures. Proponents argued that delegation leads to more efficient token usage and better reasoning due to fresh, focused contexts for sub-agents. Skeptics expressed concerns about managing the output and maintenance burden of generating vast amounts of code. The conversation also touched on the evolution of such agentic systems, noting they are becoming more viable as AI models improve, reminiscent of earlier projects like Auto-GPT.

## [Adoption of EVs tied to real-world reductions in air pollution: study](https://keck.usc.edu/news/adoption-of-electric-vehicles-tied-to-real-world-reductions-in-air-pollution-study-finds/)
**Score:** 379 | **Comments:** 308 | **ID:** 46749198

> **Article:** A study from USC Keck analyzed air quality data in California neighborhoods from 2019 to 2023, correlating the registration of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) with satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). The researchers found a measurable improvement in local air quality: for every 200 new ZEVs registered in a neighborhood, NO₂ levels dropped by 1.1%. This provides real-world evidence that the adoption of electric vehicles directly reduces air pollution in the communities where they are driven.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely affirmed the study's findings, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes about the negative impacts of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle pollution, such as the smell of diesel exhaust and visible soot from older cars. The conversation branched into several key themes:

*   **Local vs. Displaced Pollution:** While one user noted the study only measures local air quality (not total pollution), others countered that moving pollution from dense residential areas to more isolated power plants is a significant public health benefit, even before accounting for the cleaner energy grid.
*   **Broader Environmental Concerns:** Skeptics raised common counterarguments against EVs, including their heavier weight causing faster road degradation and the environmental impact of lithium mining. These were largely rebutted by others who argued that tire/brake pollution is less severe than tailpipe emissions (especially with regenerative braking), and that the pollution from fossil fuel extraction and burning far exceeds that from battery manufacturing.
*   **Global Perspectives:** Commenters drew parallels from cities like Beijing, where rapid EV adoption has visibly improved air quality, and Bangkok, where traffic pollution remains a major issue. A more philosophical point was raised that established Western cities are often resistant to the large-scale infrastructure changes needed for such improvements, unlike rapidly developing cities in East Asia.
*   **Practical and Tangible Benefits:** Beyond the data, users highlighted immediate quality-of-life benefits, such as the absence of exhaust fumes in home garages. There was also a discussion on the future of the automotive industry, with some arguing that Tesla's Cybertruck isn't the right vehicle to drive mass adoption of electric trucks, but that battery technology and charging infrastructure will be the key factors.

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes how the author, Micah Cantor, added a Bluesky-powered comment section to his static blog. Instead of running his own comment system, he embeds a Bluesky "embed" that displays a specific post and its replies. The process involves creating a post on Bluesky for each blog post and then using Bluesky's official embed code to display the comment thread on the blog. This approach offloads the complexity of hosting, moderation, and user authentication to Bluesky, while keeping the blog itself completely static. The author presents this as a simple, effective solution for static sites that want interactive comments without the overhead of a traditional commenting service.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 232 | **Comments:** 200 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article argues that Europe is increasingly seeking "digital sovereignty" to reduce its dangerous reliance on US internet technology and infrastructure. It highlights growing concerns over data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and economic dependency on American tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The piece cites initiatives in European cities, such as Helsingborg in Sweden, which are testing how public services would function during a hypothetical digital blackout. The author suggests that Europe must develop its own secure, independent digital ecosystem to protect its political and economic stability from external control and potential disruptions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, with many commenters viewing the move away from US tech as not only necessary but overdue. The consensus is that US tech oligarchs have become too powerful and that their interests are increasingly misaligned with those of European citizens and governments. Several users point out that reliance on US platforms creates significant security risks, especially given the political volatility in the US, and that Europe should treat digital independence as a critical matter of national security.

However, the conversation also highlights significant challenges and skepticism. Some commenters express a defeatist attitude, noting that US tech is deeply entrenched and that European alternatives often lack the same level of integration or convenience. A key point of contention is Europe's ability to compete, with one user arguing that Europe's social policies, such as shorter work weeks and generous leave, hinder the innovation needed to rival US and Chinese tech industries. Others are cynical about the EU's bureaucracy, fearing that by the time any meaningful action is taken, the political landscape may have shifted against it.

The discussion also touches on the broader context of "digital imperialism," with parallels drawn to other nations like India and Russia. While some see open-source software as a viable path to sovereignty, others are concerned about the sheer scale of the challenge, which extends beyond internet technology to include payment systems, operating systems, and business software. Ultimately, while there is strong support for the goal of digital independence, the path forward is seen as fraught with economic, political, and cultural obstacles.

## [Poland's energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46747827

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica reports that Poland's energy grid was targeted by a novel piece of wiper malware. The attack, which aimed to disrupt communication between power generation sites and grid operators, ultimately failed and did not cause any power outages. The malware is described as "never-before-seen," suggesting a sophisticated threat actor. The article draws a parallel to a successful 2015 cyberattack in Ukraine that left 230,000 people without electricity for six hours.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News primarily focused on the geopolitical context and motivations behind the attack. The consensus among commenters is that Russia is the likely perpetrator, with the attack being an extension of its ongoing conflict with Europe. Poland's role as a key logistical hub for military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine was cited as the clear motive for targeting its critical infrastructure.

Commenters debated the security of industrial control systems, questioning how such networks could be breached. While some assumed these systems would be air-gapped, others noted that even air-gapped networks are vulnerable to social engineering or insider threats, and that communication links to the outside world often exist. The failure of the attack was noted as a positive outcome, though it also "burned" a valuable zero-day exploit for the attackers, giving defenders an opportunity to learn.

The conversation broadened to include several other themes:
*   **Economic and Psychological Warfare:** Users compared the cyberattack to other forms of hybrid warfare, such as psy-ops and economic sabotage. One commenter drew a parallel to the costly Jaguar cyberattack in the UK, arguing that digital attacks on infrastructure should be treated with the same seriousness as physical aggression.
*   **EU Disunity and Response:** A significant portion of the discussion criticized the European Union's perceived lack of a unified and effective response to Russian aggression. Commenters blamed internal divisions, particularly between France and Germany, and pointed to the hypocrisy of continuing to purchase Russian energy while claiming to oppose the regime.
*   **Symmetry of Conflict:** Some users questioned why similar cyberattacks are not reported within Russia, speculating whether its older, less connected infrastructure makes it less vulnerable or if such events are simply not publicized.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 213 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article, authored by MP Zarah Sultana, argues that Palantir should be excluded from UK public services, particularly the Ministry of Defence. It frames Palantir as a company with deep ties to US intelligence and military operations, whose involvement threatens UK sovereignty and democratic oversight. The piece highlights concerns over the company's controversial history, its CEO's statements, and the potential for its data integration tools to enable mass surveillance and undermine civil liberties. The article calls for a rejection of Palantir's contracts in favor of more transparent and accountable alternatives.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with commenters debating the specific issue of Palantir, the broader problem of US big tech in government, and the nature of surveillance states.

A significant portion of the conversation shifts focus from Palantir specifically to the larger ecosystem of US technology giants. Several users argue that companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Apple are equally or more dangerous due to their scale and existing infrastructure, making the singling out of Palantir somewhat arbitrary. The consensus among these commenters is that reliance on any major US tech firm for critical public services poses a sovereignty risk, and the ultimate goal should be to develop and use European or domestic alternatives.

The topic of mass surveillance in the UK is a recurring theme. Commenters express a sense of inevitability and resignation, suggesting that the UK has been gradually building a surveillance state for years and that it may be "too late to get off the train." This is framed as a societal acceptance of monitoring, enabled by both government policy and the privatization of public spaces.

The article's author, Zarah Sultana, becomes a point of contention. One commenter dismisses her as a "racist conspiracy theorist," linking to sources to support this claim. However, this is met with skepticism from others who urge caution and note the highly polarized nature of accusations from "both sides," suggesting the source of the criticism may be biased propaganda.

Finally, there is a pragmatic counter-argument to the article's premise. One user contends that Palantir is simply fulfilling a demand from the government for tools that achieve specific outcomes, and that other large consulting firms or tech companies would gladly provide similar services. This perspective suggests the issue is not with Palantir itself, but with the government's goals, and that simply banning one vendor without addressing the underlying demand is a naive and ineffective solution.

## [Tao Te Ching – Translated by Ursula K. Le Guin](https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46745233

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository containing Ursula K. Le Guin's "rendition" of the Tao Te Ching. Le Guin notes in her introduction that this is not a direct translation, as she does not know Chinese, but rather a creative interpretation based on existing translations and her own literary sensibilities. The text presents the ancient Chinese classic through Le Guin's distinct poetic and philosophical voice.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep appreciation for both the Tao Te Ching and Ursula K. Le Guin's work. Commenters frequently praise Le Guin's rendition, with many considering it their favorite English version despite its status as an interpretation rather than a literal translation. The conversation explores the nature of translation itself, with users comparing it to musical covers and arguing that all translations inevitably imprint the translator's perspective, especially with poetic or ancient texts.

Several users connect the Tao's themes to Le Guin's fiction, particularly the Earthsea series, noting the pervasive influence of Eastern philosophy in her writing. There's also a recurring theme of the Tao's relevance to modern life and professional contexts, with one user suggesting that the best engineers embody the "low, quiet, and unseen" strength described in the text.

The discussion touches on cultural adaptation, with one commenter noting that the Taoist values of quiet strength might not translate well to American success metrics, particularly for immigrants. Another user humorously references "The Tao of the Dude" from The Big Lebowski, while others express frustration with what they see as performative engagement with Eastern philosophy.

A minor controversy emerges around copyright, with some users questioning the GitHub posting of Le Guin's work while others defend it as a reasonable sharing of a deceased author's interpretation of a 2000-year-old text. The conversation concludes with users sharing resources for comparing multiple translations and reflecting on the Tao's enduring wisdom about beauty, ugliness, and the gap between intention and outcome in technology and life.

## [I Like GitLab](https://www.whileforloop.com/en/blog/2026/01/21/i-like-gitlab/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46742432

> **Article:** The article "I Like GitLab" is a personal endorsement of the GitLab platform. The author details their positive experience, likely highlighting GitLab's "all-in-one" nature that integrates source code management (like GitHub), issue tracking, and powerful CI/CD capabilities in a single application. The piece appears to be a favorable review, appreciating the platform's comprehensive feature set and unified workflow for software development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a balanced and nuanced view of GitLab, with users weighing its comprehensive feature set against its significant resource and performance costs. The conversation can be broken down into a few key themes:

A central point of agreement is GitLab's strength as an integrated, all-in-one platform. Many users, particularly in corporate environments, praise its powerful, built-in CI/CD, which is often seen as superior to alternatives like GitHub Actions and a reason to prefer it over more fragmented setups. The self-hosting capability is also frequently cited as a major advantage, offering control and data sovereignty.

However, a strong counter-argument revolves around GitLab's performance and resource intensity. Several commenters describe the GitLab interface as "slow" and "painful," and note that it demands significant server resources, making it expensive and cumbersome to self-host, especially for personal projects. This has led many to seek out more lightweight alternatives.

Consequently, a significant portion of the discussion focuses on these alternatives, primarily Forgejo and Gitea. Users who switched to these platforms highlight their speed, efficiency, and ease of setup, noting they provide essential features (CI, issue tracking) without the bloat. The debate between Forgejo (written in Go) and its predecessor Gitea was also touched upon, with some preferring the newer fork's direction.

Finally, there is a recurring critique of GitLab's "papercuts." Despite its power, users report long-standing, unresolved bugs and a feeling that many features are underdeveloped or stuck in an "MVP" state. This creates a frustrating user experience where simple tasks can be unexpectedly difficult. While some praised the recent move to a Single-Page Application (SPA) for improving speed, others found it made the interface even slower.

**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46745944

> **Article:** A federal law enforcement officer, identified as an ICE agent, shot and killed a man in Minneapolis during an immigration enforcement operation. According to the article, the incident occurred when agents attempted to stop a vehicle, and the driver allegedly struck an officer with the car. The driver was subsequently shot and pronounced dead at the scene. The officer sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The shooting is currently under investigation by the FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. This event is noted as part of a broader "immigration crackdown" occurring in the area.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was moved to a previous thread regarding the same incident, where the conversation focused heavily on the reliability of official narratives versus eyewitness accounts. Many commenters expressed skepticism toward the initial police report, citing historical precedents where official versions of events were later contradicted by video evidence or independent investigations. The debate centered on the difficulty of determining the truth in the immediate aftermath of police-involved shootings and the public's eroding trust in law enforcement statements.

There was also significant discussion regarding the role of federal agencies, specifically ICE, in local enforcement actions. Users debated the implications of federal immigration agents engaging in operations that result in lethal force, particularly within sanctuary jurisdictions. The conversation touched on the broader political context of immigration enforcement and the potential for escalation during routine stops. Several users highlighted the lack of immediate, independent oversight in federal investigations compared to local police procedures.

## [Postmortem: Our first VLEO satellite mission (with imagery and flight data)](https://albedo.com/post/clarity-1-what-worked-and-where-we-go-next)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46747119

> **Article:** Albedo, a space technology company, published a detailed postmortem of its first Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) satellite mission, Clarity-1. The mission aimed to demonstrate high-resolution optical imaging from an unprecedented low altitude (around 250km). The postmortem outlines the mission's successes, including capturing high-quality imagery and validating their custom satellite bus, as well as the challenges faced. Key issues included the failure of the Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) due to lubricant issues at operating temperatures, intermittent memory errors in the third-party TT&C radio that eventually led to a loss of the satellite, and the need for in-flight software workarounds. The article concludes with lessons learned, emphasizing the importance of deeper supply chain vetting, in-house component development (like radios), and robust pre-flight testing for thermal environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded with a mix of technical curiosity, praise, and constructive criticism. The discussion can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Technical Deep Dives:** Users asked specific questions about the mission's engineering. A prominent query was about achieving 10cm resolution, which seemed to challenge the theoretical diffraction limit of a 1m optic at 250km. Other technical questions focused on the software stack, FPGA updates, and the root cause of the radio's memory corruption, with the company confirming plans to build their own radios in the future to gain better control and diagnostic capabilities.

*   **Systems Engineering and Testing:** A central point of discussion was the failure of the CMGs due to lubricant issues. Commenters questioned why this wasn't caught during ground-based thermal vacuum testing, suggesting the tests may not have been long or rigorous enough. The Albedo CEO acknowledged this as a key lesson in vetting supply chains deeply, even for components from established suppliers.

*   **Business and Communication Strategy:** A notable critique emerged regarding the article's writing style. One commenter argued that the informal, "tech bro" tone (e.g., "nailed it," "locked in") could be unappealing to the conservative, corporate clients that fund large space projects. They advised adopting a more professional tone to secure lucrative contracts. This sparked a counter-debate, with others defending the style as appropriate for a company blog aimed at attracting talent and engaging a wider audience.

*   **Future Plans and Market:** Questions about Albedo's business model revealed their focus is on providing VLEO systems and services rather than directly selling imagery. The CEO also discussed future improvements in geolocation accuracy, aiming for 3-5 meters without ground control points by refining their pointing calibration process.

*   **General Praise and Minor Notes:** The postmortem was widely praised as an impressive and transparent account of a complex first mission. A minor technical note was also raised about an expired domain on one of their links.

## [Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 113 | **ID:** 46744807

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asks if others are experiencing an issue where Gmail's spam filter has suddenly started marking legitimate emails as spam. The post seeks to confirm if this is a widespread problem or an isolated incident.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion confirms that many users are experiencing issues with Gmail's filtering, though the specific symptoms vary. A key point is the distinction between emails being outright marked as spam versus being flagged as "suspicious" or "unsafe" with a banner warning that the message could not be scanned. This seems to be a significant part of the problem, affecting legitimate senders like the USPS and internal HR communications.

Several users report that the filter's behavior has become more aggressive, causing delays of up to 10 minutes for important emails and seemingly ignoring user-created rules like "Never mark as spam." The root cause is suggested to be crowd-sourced filter weights, and one user posits that the "scanners are unavailable/disabled," leading to the "could not be scanned" warnings. This malfunction is also causing a reverse problem, with some users receiving ads and obvious spam in their Primary inbox. The issue is significant enough to be causing 2FA and password recovery delays and prompting many users to disable email notifications on their phones and watches.

## [Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison](https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46745922

> **Article:** The article "Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison" benchmarks the processing speed of all five generations of Raspberry Pi. The tests include compiling software, running Python scripts, and decoding a 1080p H.264 video. The results show a massive performance leap with each generation, culminating in the Pi 5 being over 600 times faster than the original Pi 1. The article also notes the increasing power consumption and thermal management requirements of the newer models.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely focused on the practical utility of the performance gains and the trade-offs involved in upgrading Raspberry Pi models. Several users noted that for many long-standing hobbyist projects like OctoPrint or RetroPie, the performance of older models like the Pi 3 remains perfectly adequate. A recurring theme was the increasing complexity and power requirements of newer Pis, with some users expressing a desire for a simpler, more reliable board rather than one with higher raw performance.

There was also significant technical debate around the article's benchmark choices. Commenters pointed out that the original Pi 1 was specifically designed for 1080p video playback using its dedicated VideoCore GPU, making the software-based video decoding test on the Pi 5 a poor comparison of architectural strengths. Others highlighted the Pi 5's superior capabilities in areas like AES encryption, which was not tested. The conversation also touched on the Raspberry Pi Foundation's historical attitude towards users pushing the hardware to its limits, with one commenter sharing an anecdote about being dismissed for reporting a thermal throttling bug.

Finally, the discussion included practical advice on power consumption and alternative hardware. Users dissected the power draw differences between Pi 3 models (B, B+, and A+) and suggested that for non-GPIO tasks, a used mini-PC offers vastly superior performance and compatibility for a similar price, albeit with higher energy usage.

## [Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46742635

> **Article:** The article "Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite" argues that for an embedded database like SQLite, executing numerous small, separate queries can be more performant than a single, complex, monolithic query. The author (D. Richard Hipp) demonstrates this using the Fossil SCM's timeline view as a case study. The key reason is that SQLite's overhead is minimal when called from the same process, whereas a monolithic query often involves significant application-level processing (e.g., string manipulation, data restructuring) after the database returns a large, complex result set. By breaking the work into many small queries, the application can often process and display data incrementally, leading to lower overall latency and simpler code. The article frames this as a counter-intuitive but practical optimization strategy for local applications, where the cost of a database call is negligible compared to network latency in client-server architectures.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the fundamental difference between embedded and client-server databases. The central theme is that SQLite's primary advantage is the elimination of network overhead. Commenters explain that even a localhost connection to a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL involves significant overhead from the network stack, serialization, and inter-process communication, whereas SQLite is a simple function call within the application's address space.

The conversation then explores the practical trade-offs. While many small queries are efficient for reads in SQLite, several users caution about its limitations, particularly with write concurrency. One commenter noted that even with low traffic, concurrent writes from background workers (e.g., Celery) can cause contention and force a migration to a server-based database like Postgres. This highlights that the choice isn't just about read performance but also about the application's overall architecture and concurrency needs.

There's also a debate on when a single, complex query is superior. For analytical workloads, a monolithic query allows the database optimizer to see the full picture and perform more efficient joins and aggregations, which is a key advantage of server-based databases. However, for typical application record retrievals (like the Fossil timeline), the article's approach is deemed more suitable.

Finally, the discussion touches on scalability strategies. One user mentioned a modern pattern of using sharded SQLite databases (e.g., Cloudflare D1), where each customer gets their own database, combining the simplicity of SQLite with horizontal scalability. The overall consensus is that SQLite is a highly performant and often underestimated choice for a vast range of applications, especially when its architectural fit (embedded, low-concurrency writes) is understood.

## [Nvidia-smi hangs indefinitely after ~66 days](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/971)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46750425

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules repository where users report a critical bug: `nvidia-smi` and other GPU-dependent jobs hang indefinitely after the system has been running for approximately 66 days and 12 hours. The issue affects systems with B200 GPUs and NVLink, and a restart is the only known fix. The precise cause is unknown, but users suspect a 32-bit counter overflow related to uptime or NVLink activity, as errors appear just before the hang. The exact timing has led to speculation about a specific bit-width limitation in a time-keeping or counter variable.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revolves around diagnosing the bug's cause, sharing similar debugging war stories, and correcting common programming errors. The primary theory is that the 66-day uptime corresponds to the overflow of a 32-bit counter, likely one that has been scaled by a factor (e.g., milliseconds or nanoseconds), leading to a wraparound bug that halts the system. This is a classic example of a long-running counter overflow, a problem that has affected many systems.

Many commenters shared personal anecdotes of similar long-term stability bugs. One user recounted a harrowing experience debugging a Raspberry Pi kernel bug that caused the entire USB stack to fail after about a week, which was difficult to diagnose due to the long feedback loop. Another mentioned a National Instruments driver that failed precisely every 31 days due to a Windows timer overflow. These stories highlight the unique challenges of debugging issues that only manifest after days or weeks of continuous operation.

Beyond the overflow theory, the discussion touched on several other points. A user pointed out a fundamental Linux kernel best practice: using `time_before()` and `time_after()` macros for timestamp comparisons to correctly handle counter wraparound, suggesting the NVIDIA driver may have used a simple and incorrect comparison. Another user humorously noted that the bug's duration is nearly 66.6 days, while another found a potential Easter egg where an internal NVIDIA bug report number matches the number of seconds in the 66-day period. Finally, a minor thread debated the use of the word "randomly" versus "unpredictably" to describe the bug's behavior.

## [Second Win11 emergency out of band update to address disastrous Patch Tuesday](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-second-emergency-out-of-band-update-kb5078127-released-address-outlook-bugs)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46750358

> **Article:** Microsoft released a second emergency "out-of-band" update (KB5078127) for Windows 11 to fix critical bugs introduced in the previous Patch Tuesday. The primary issues addressed were related to Microsoft Outlook and other connectivity problems that were affecting users' ability to access their email and cloud services.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly negative, focusing on the declining quality and performance of Windows 11. Users are expressing significant frustration with bugs and system sluggishness. Key themes include:

*   **System Performance and Bloat:** Multiple users reported that Windows 11 is "slower than ever," with one user describing a brand new laptop as feeling "unbelievably slow and sluggish," particularly when using the File Explorer. This is attributed to bloat and the use of web technologies like React in core parts of the OS.
*   **Broken Core Features:** A major point of contention is the unreliability of Windows Search, which one user noted has been "broken for years" and often shows a blank white screen. This has led many to seek third-party alternatives like PowerToys.
*   **Criticism of Microsoft's Development Practices:** Commenters heavily criticized Microsoft's development culture, using terms like "slop" and "vibe patching." They blame the use of AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot) and a reliance on web technologies for the poor quality and instability of the operating system.
*   **Migration to Linux:** The issues are driving users to consider or switch to Linux. One commenter shared a detailed positive experience with Fedora, noting better hardware respect, efficiency, and gaming performance, and stated they now only boot into Windows for work. Another suggested Debian as a stable alternative.
*   **Frustration with Windows 10's End of Life:** Some users expressed a desire to stick with the more stable Windows 10, with one noting the availability of the LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) version until 2032 as a way to maintain stability.
