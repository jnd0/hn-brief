## [Federal Agents Kill Another Person in Minneapolis Immigration Crackdown](https://time.com/7357547/minneapolis-shooting-ice-agent/)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46745944

> **Article:** A federal agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shot and killed a man in Minneapolis during an immigration enforcement operation. According to the article, the incident occurred when agents attempted to stop a vehicle; the driver allegedly struck an agent with the vehicle, prompting the agent to open fire. The shooting has sparked protests and criticism from local community leaders and lawmakers, who are calling for transparency and an investigation into the conduct of federal agents. The article highlights ongoing tensions between federal immigration authorities and local communities in the wake of increased enforcement actions.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was largely redirected to a previous thread (item 46745047) due to the topic being a duplicate. However, the comments that remained or were referenced focused on several key themes. Many users expressed skepticism toward the official narrative provided by federal agents, questioning the necessity of lethal force and pointing to a history of controversial shootings by law enforcement. There was significant debate regarding the role of ICE and U.S. immigration policy, with some arguing for stricter enforcement and others condemning the agency's tactics as overly aggressive and harmful to communities. Legal and procedural aspects were also discussed, including the jurisdiction of federal agents and the standards for use of force. The conversation reflected broader political polarization, with users debating the balance between border security, public safety, and civil liberties.

## [“Let people help” – Advice that made a big difference to a grieving widow](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/20/nx-s1-5683170/let-them-the-small-bit-of-advice-that-made-a-big-difference-to-a-grieving-widow)
**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46740748

> **Article:** The NPR article shares the story of a widow, Sarah, who was overwhelmed by grief and the logistics of life after her husband's death. While dealing with insurance paperwork, she was put on hold for an extended period. The insurance representative, sensing her distress, broke protocol to personally handle the issue and then called Sarah back to ensure she was okay. This small, unexpected act of kindness and human connection was a pivotal moment for Sarah, helping her feel seen and supported. The article highlights the profound impact of letting people offer specific, practical help rather than offering vague platitudes like "let me know if you need anything."
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the themes of practical help during grief, the nature of community, and the importance of human connection. A significant portion of the comments consists of users sharing the parable of the rabbi in Heaven and Hell, which illustrates that the environment (heaven vs. hell) is defined by whether people choose to help one another, not by their external circumstances. This story was shared to underscore the article's message about the power of mutual support.

Beyond the parable, commenters offered concrete examples of helpful actions, such as delivering pre-made meals, which is especially valuable because grieving individuals often lack the mental and emotional energy to cook. One user noted the importance of proactive help—acting without being asked—citing an example of someone who would clean shoes for a grieving household. Another commenter shared a personal story about how his wife, a widow, allowed him to help her, which became the foundation of their relationship. The conversation also touched on practical accessibility, with users appreciating a text-only version of the article for easier reading. Overall, the discussion reinforced the article's core message: specific, proactive, and practical acts of service are far more meaningful than generalized offers of help.

## [December in Servo: multiple windows, proxy support, better caching, and more](https://servo.org/blog/2026/01/23/december-in-servo/)
**Score:** 133 | **Comments:** 12 | **ID:** 46745259

> **Article:** The article from the Servo project blog announces significant progress made in December, highlighting key development milestones. These include initial support for multiple windows, proxy support, and better caching mechanisms. The post frames these updates as steps toward making Servo a more serious and viable web engine, moving beyond an experimental project.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters viewing Servo's progress as a healthy development for the open web. A central theme is the need for a viable third browser engine to break the dominance of the Blink/WebKit lineage (Chrome, Safari) and reduce reliance on Mozilla's Gecko. Many commenters express a desire for a sustainable, independent alternative, with some noting that Servo's grassroots community model is appealing.

The conversation frequently pivots to the Ladybird browser, which is presented as a parallel or complementary project. Users compare the two, noting that Ladybird is further ahead in rendering correctness (as it has its own JavaScript engine) but currently slower, while Servo is making rapid functional progress using SpiderMonkey. There is also a brief discussion on funding, with commenters highlighting EU and German government grants to Servo as a positive step toward long-term sustainability.

## [Poland's energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46747827

> **Article:** A new, never-before-seen wiper malware was used to target Poland's energy grid. The attack, which has been attributed to Russian state-sponsored actors, ultimately failed to disrupt electricity services. The article draws parallels to a 2015 attack in Ukraine that successfully left 230,000 people without power for six hours, highlighting the potential consequences of such cyberwarfare.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focuses on attributing the attack and understanding its context. Commenters overwhelmingly attribute the attack to Russia, citing the ongoing war with Europe and Poland's critical role as a logistical hub for Western aid to Ukraine. One user noted that targeting infrastructure like energy grids and railroads is an expected part of modern hybrid warfare.

A secondary theme was the silver lining of such attacks. One commenter pointed out that by deploying "weapon-grade" malware, attackers burn valuable exploits, and the failed attack provides defenders with valuable intelligence on Russian cyberwarfare techniques.

The conversation also touched on the potential impact, with a user referencing the successful 2015 attack in Ukraine as a benchmark for what could have happened. A final, more cynical comment questioned the attribution, framing it as a toss-up between Russian and US involvement in global cyber conflicts.

## [Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46744807

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asked if others are experiencing issues with Gmail's spam filter suddenly and aggressively marking legitimate emails (like USPS notifications, HR emails, and system alerts) as spam or suspicious. They are seeking confirmation from the community if this is a widespread problem.
>
> **Discussion:** The community largely confirmed the issue, with users reporting a noticeable degradation in Gmail's filtering accuracy. The discussion highlighted several key problems: legitimate emails are being incorrectly flagged as "suspicious" or "unsafe" and delayed by several minutes, while actual spam is slipping into primary inboxes. Users also noted that Gmail's categorization is malfunctioning, misclassifying emails (e.g., sending promotions to the primary tab) and ignoring user-defined rules like "never mark as spam."

Technical explanations suggested that the issue might stem from Google's crowd-sourced filter weights or temporary scanning failures, as indicated by messages stating "Gmail hasn't scanned this message." While some users reported not seeing the issue, the consensus was that the algorithm has become overly aggressive or unstable. The conversation also touched on broader spam management strategies, with one user advising never to disclose one's email address to avoid spam, while others defended Gmail's historical performance, noting that it usually catches more legitimate emails in spam than it lets spam through to the inbox.

## [Bye Bye Gmail](https://m24tom.com/bye-bye-gmail/show)
**Score:** 110 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46746946

> **Article:** The author, Tom, announces his departure from Gmail after being a long-time user and early adopter. The catalyst for this decision was the recent, mandatory introduction of AI-generated summaries at the top of emails, which he found intrusive and could not disable without turning off other essential "Smart Features." This led him to reconsider the fundamental privacy bargain of Gmail. While he was previously comfortable with Google scanning his emails for targeted advertising, he is not okay with his personal and commercial correspondence being used to train Google's Large Language Models (LLMs). He views this as an unacceptable risk to his data and writing style. Consequently, he is migrating his email to Microsoft Outlook, with ProtonMail in Switzerland as a future option if Microsoft implements similar AI features.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on validating the author's frustrations and exploring alternatives to major email providers. A key point of contention was the author's claim that disabling "Smart Features" makes Gmail unusable; one commenter refuted this, stating it's perfectly functional and that the AI summaries were the real issue. The community largely agreed that the new AI features are aggressive and difficult to disable without sacrificing other useful, long-standing functionalities.

The conversation then shifted to evaluating potential replacements. The author's choice of Microsoft was widely criticized as "out of the frying pan, into the fire," with users pointing out Microsoft's own privacy issues. Fastmail emerged as a popular recommendation, praised for its features (like tagging and sieve filtering) and usability, though one user noted its spam filtering was weak. Other options discussed included self-hosting (deemed difficult and inadvisable for most), Zoho, and Swiss providers like Infomaniak and ProtonMail. ProtonMail faced criticism for its limited search capabilities and lack of standard IMAP support due to its encryption model.

Finally, the practicalities of migrating from a long-standing Gmail account were addressed. Suggestions included using Google Takeout for data export, setting up automatic forwarding to the new address, and leveraging migration tools offered by services like Fastmail.
