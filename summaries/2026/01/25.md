## [ICE using Palantir tool that feeds on Medicaid data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/report-ice-using-palantir-tool-feeds-medicaid-data)
**Score:** 628 | **Comments:** 346 | **ID:** 46756117

> **Article:** An Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing a Palantir tool called ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement). This tool aggregates data from various government sources, including addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses Medicaid records. The article highlights privacy concerns regarding the merging of health data with law enforcement databases to track and target individuals for immigration enforcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the surveillance infrastructure, focusing on the dangers of data aggregation and the potential for abuse.

Key themes include:
*   **The Fallacy of "Nothing to Hide":** Several users argued that privacy is essential regardless of current innocence, citing risks such as abusive partners in law enforcement accessing data or the potential for system errors ("hallucinations") to cause wrongful raids.
*   **Systemic Entrenchment:** Commenters expressed pessimism about dismantling these systems, noting that once built, surveillance tools tend to expand in application. Some suggested that the existence of such infrastructure actively prevents political leaders who might oppose it from gaining power.
*   **Data Mechanics and Scope:** Users debated the connection between Medicaid and immigration enforcement. While the article notes that some states provide Medicaid to immigrants, commenters suggested the tool targets a broader range of individuals beyond just "illegal immigrants," using immigration status as a public pretext for wider surveillance.
*   **Political and Ideological Divides:** The conversation touched on the polarization of privacy issues, with one user noting that those who defend police anonymity often hold different fundamental values. Others debated the role of federalism, arguing that decentralized state-level social services would offer better protection against a centralized federal database.
*   **Calls for Action:** Sentiment ranged from hopes for future leaders to destroy the infrastructure to suggestions that engineers should "poison" the datasets or that employees should quit these projects to hinder development.

## [A flawed paper in management science has been cited more than 6k times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 580 | **Comments:** 307 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The linked article from the statistical modeling blog "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science" critiques a highly influential paper in management science that has accumulated over 6,000 citations. The author, Andrew Gelman, argues that despite its massive citation count, the paper contains significant flaws. The post highlights a common issue in academic research where citation volume is often mistaken for validity. It emphasizes that single studies, regardless of their prestige or citation numbers, should not be treated as definitive proof. The article advocates for a more rigorous scientific culture where replication is valued and where researchers stop citing single studies as conclusive evidence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expressing widespread cynicism regarding the reliability of highly cited academic papers. The conversation reveals a systemic problem where the incentive structures of academia discourage correction and replication.

A dominant theme is the personal and professional risk associated with challenging established research. Several users shared anecdotes of failed replication attempts, with one commenter noting their daughter abandoned academia for the private sector after her university refused to pursue a retraction to avoid political friction with tenured peer reviewers. Another user described a family member who had to switch research subjects entirely after discovering faked data, noting that exposing misconduct is often "career suicide" for junior researchers.

Commenters also discussed the structural flaws in academic publishing:
*   **Incentives for Novelty over Accuracy:** Users noted that the system favors "novel" findings over replication studies. One suggested that the only practical way to correct the literature is to publish "contrarian research" that yields different results, as journals are reluctant to publish studies that simply show "no effect."
*   **Citation Inflation:** There was consensus that raw citation counts are increasingly meaningless. Users described seeing "citation rings" and author count inflation used to game metrics. One user proposed a theoretical "trust network" overlay for citations to flag papers that uncritically cite flawed work, though others were skeptical that such a system could avoid being gamed itself.
*   **The "Don't Rock the Boat" Culture:** The discussion highlighted a pervasive culture of compliance. One commenter noted that in their field (sensor development), papers are often "optimistic" or gloss over limitations, and that raising corrections—even before publication—faces high barriers.

Finally, the discussion touched on the ethical dimension of flawed research. While some commenters debated whether authors of flawed (or fraudulent) papers are "bad people," the consensus leaned toward holding researchers accountable for choosing the "easy path" of ignoring errors rather than correcting them. The conversation also cited parallel examples in other fields, such as the "Harvard Goal Study" (a non-existent study often cited in corporate settings) and the "Jick Study" on opioid addiction, to illustrate how fabricated or misinterpreted research can permeate professional discourse.

## [Adoption of EVs tied to real-world reductions in air pollution: study](https://keck.usc.edu/news/adoption-of-electric-vehicles-tied-to-real-world-reductions-in-air-pollution-study-finds/)
**Score:** 564 | **Comments:** 556 | **ID:** 46749198

> **Article:** A study from USC Keck analyzed air quality data across California neighborhoods from 2019 to 2023, correlating the registration of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) with satellite-measured nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels. The researchers found a direct, measurable reduction in air pollution: for every 200 new ZEVs registered in a neighborhood, NO₂ levels dropped by 1.1%. This indicates that the adoption of electric vehicles is tied to real-world improvements in local air quality.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding the study was multifaceted, with users largely agreeing on the benefits of EVs for local air quality while raising several related concerns.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the visceral experience of pollution. Commenters shared personal anecdotes of being bothered by diesel fumes and old, poorly maintained internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, expressing a strong desire for the noise and smell of traffic to disappear. This sentiment was supported by personal accounts from users living in cities like Bangkok and Beijing, who described how the adoption of EVs has made urban centers quieter and significantly improved air quality, transforming the daily living experience.

However, the discussion also introduced several counterpoints and complexities:
*   **Infrastructure and Vehicle Types:** Some users argued that Tesla's Cybertruck is not the solution for mass adoption, citing the success of the Ford Lightning and noting that wider adoption depends on developing "normal" trucks, better battery capacity, and megawatt charging infrastructure.
*   **Broader Environmental Impacts:** A critical perspective highlighted that EVs are heavier, causing faster road degradation (referencing the fourth power law), and that pollution is often externalized to other countries through lithium mining. This was countered by the argument that the pollution from EV batteries is still significantly lower than that from fossil fuels and that modern EV designs can mitigate weight issues.
*   **Other Pollution Sources:** It was noted that tire and brake particulates remain a source of pollution for EVs, though regenerative braking reduces brake dust. However, a key clarification was that the study specifically measured NO₂, which is primarily an exhaust emission and not related to tires or brakes.
*   **Methodology and Scope:** While some questioned if factors like COVID-19 lockdowns influenced the data, others pointed out that the study's methodology (tracking neighborhood-level data over several years) effectively controlled for such variables. It was also clarified that the study focused specifically on the benefits of reducing pollution where people live and work, separate from the debate on power plant emissions.
*   **Future Outlook:** Commenters generally agreed that EVs represent a step forward, with some envisioning a future where "dumb" (non-smart) EVs become more popular and where the decline of ICE infrastructure (gas stations, mechanics) will accelerate the transition.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 545 | **Comments:** 261 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The article at netzbremse.de (German for "internet brake") alleges that Deutsche Telekom is intentionally throttling the internet by under-dimensioning its network transit access points. The core claim is that to achieve decent connection speeds for Telekom customers, internet services are forced to purchase expensive, direct contracts with Telekom, rather than relying on standard transit providers. This practice effectively penalizes services that do not pay for direct peering, degrading performance for a significant portion of German internet users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals widespread user frustration with Deutsche Telekom (DT), focusing on personal experiences, structural market issues, and broader cultural contradictions.

Many commenters confirm the article's premise with personal anecdotes. Users report slow website loading times, especially in the evenings, and specific issues with services behind Cloudflare, which sometimes result in complete outages or extreme latency. One user noted that their self-hosted site only became accessible again after they cancelled their DT contract, suggesting a deliberate obstruction. The lack of viable alternatives is a major pain point; several users in areas with a DT monopoly expressed frustration, with one mentioning rain-dependent DSL line failures as a catalyst for switching to Starlink. While some have access to competitors like Vodafone, they note it's often a choice between different poor options.

The discussion quickly broadened into a critique of Germany's internet infrastructure and governance. A key theme is the failure to enforce open-access infrastructure, which would allow smaller ISPs to compete, contrasting Germany's approach with Switzerland's. This is framed as part of a larger German paradox: a leading economy with significant bureaucratic and infrastructural problems, from railways to internet. The DT's aggressive peering strategy—refusing cost-neutral agreements and forcing partners to become customers—was highlighted as a notorious industry practice that degrades global connectivity for German users.

Finally, the conversation touched on the practical impact on developers and businesses. One commenter suggested that German users are notoriously difficult to monetize, leading developers to de-prioritize localization. The consensus is that DT's de facto monopoly allows it to provide subpar service without significant customer loss, forcing many to seek alternatives like Starlink despite personal misgivings about the provider.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 392 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Posturr," an open-source macOS application. The app uses the computer's camera to monitor a user's posture. If the user slouches, the application automatically blurs the screen to encourage them to sit up straight. The project is written in Swift and is currently available as a free tool rather than a commercial product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response was a mix of interest in the concept and skepticism regarding the implementation and practicality.

Security and privacy were the primary concerns. Several users expressed hesitation about running an unaudited, open-source application that accesses the camera, suggesting that the developer should monetize the app and get it notarized by Apple to build trust. However, others countered that the codebase is small enough (under 1000 lines) to be easily audited by an AI tool or a human.

Technical aspects of the app were scrutinized. The author clarified that an earlier, experimental integration with "Claude" (an AI coding assistant) to assess posture was scrapped because it was too slow and inaccurate; the current version uses a simpler, more reliable computer vision method based on head height. Some commenters questioned the app's logic regarding different body types, wondering how it distinguishes between a short person slouching and a tall person sitting normally, though it was noted that the app likely establishes a baseline for the individual user.

Finally, the discussion broadened to general ergonomics. Commenters debated whether perfect posture is actually conducive to productivity, with many admitting to their own "comfortable" slouching habits. There was a consensus that using a laptop with good posture is nearly impossible without external hardware (like a stand or external monitor), and some users shared recommendations for ergonomic chairs or expressed interest in future technologies like AR glasses to solve the posture problem.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 286 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named arin-s has successfully ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro earbuds. The project is notable not just for the port itself, but for its accessibility: a web-based interface allows anyone to join a queue and play the game remotely on the earbuds from their own PC. The developer has also made the source code available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of amusement, curiosity, and deeper analysis, typical of "it runs Doom" posts. The initial comments focused on the novelty of the port, with users linking to the canonical Wikipedia list and the "itrunsdoom" subreddit. A common thread of misunderstanding was the assumption that the game was being controlled or viewed acoustically through the earbuds, which the developer clarified was not the case.

The discussion quickly pivoted to the hardware itself. Users inquired about the quality of the PineBuds Pro, with one of the original testers noting that while the device is great, the battery life is limited (around 2 hours with ANC on). This led to a broader debate about the nature of such ports. One user questioned whether the ability to run a 33-year-old game on modern, multi-purpose hardware like an earbud's microcontroller is a triumph of software efficiency or an "economic failure" to build cheaper, purpose-built chips. This was countered by the argument that it's actually an economic success, where economies of scale have made powerful, general-purpose hardware the cheapest option for many applications, even when overkill for the task.

Finally, the conversation followed a familiar pattern of speculating on the next frontier for Doom ports. Users humorously suggested running it on disposable vape CPUs, with one commenter providing a technical breakdown of why the 3KB of RAM in typical vape microcontrollers is insufficient for Doom's 4MB requirement, estimating a viable port might be a decade away.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 285 | **Comments:** 240 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article argues that Europe is increasingly seeking to reduce its dependence on US internet technology and infrastructure. This push for "digital sovereignty" is driven by concerns over security, economic competition, and political autonomy. The piece highlights that Europe is taking concrete steps, such as conducting digital blackout exercises in cities like Helsingborg to test the resilience of public services without US tech, and investing in local cloud and software alternatives. The goal is to mitigate the risks associated with relying on foreign tech giants and to foster a more self-sufficient European digital ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, with many commenters viewing Europe's move to reduce reliance on US tech as a necessary and "sane" step for any sovereign nation. The conversation explores several key themes.

A primary driver identified is the growing distrust of US tech oligarchs and the American political system. Commenters argue that US tech companies are "anti-human," engaged in surveillance capitalism, and that the US political system serves billionaire interests over citizens', making European alternatives more appealing for privacy and ethical reasons.

However, significant skepticism exists regarding Europe's ability to execute this vision. Some commenters express a defeatist attitude, believing US tech is too entrenched to be displaced. Others are more critical of Europe's own structure, arguing that its regulatory environment ("idiot EU bureaucrats") and social policies (like shorter work weeks and generous leave) hinder the innovation and competitiveness needed to challenge US and Chinese tech dominance. There's a fear that any progress could be undone by a political shift towards right-wing parties allied with US tech giants.

The discussion also touches on the practical challenges and scope of the issue. While some see open-source software as a viable path to sovereignty, others point out the deep entanglement of Europe's entire digital infrastructure—from operating systems and business software to payment processors like Visa and Mastercard—with US entities. The conversation broadens to include the idea that this is a global issue of "digital imperialism," with other nations like India also facing similar dilemmas. Finally, some commenters frame the issue as a matter of national security, suggesting that Europe is late to the game and that only serious, large-scale efforts, potentially spurred by external threats like Russia, will be sufficient to build true resilience.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 275 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A Time magazine article reports that senior local health officials in Iran have claimed the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article notes that Time has been unable to independently verify these figures, with the primary source cited being a German-Iranian eye doctor. The report highlights the severe government crackdown, internet shutdowns, and the difficulty in obtaining on-the-ground information.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and skeptical, focusing primarily on the credibility of the death toll figures rather than the tragedy itself. A central theme is the distrust of US media and government narratives, with several commenters drawing parallels to the lead-up to the Iraq War and warning against "manufacturing consent" for military intervention. Users express skepticism about the 30,000 figure, questioning the sourcing and noting the lack of independent verification, while others argue that the Iranian government's opacity and internet shutdowns make high casualty figures plausible.

The conversation also branches into technical and comparative topics. One significant thread discusses the effectiveness of internet censorship, with a user lamenting that developers have become complacent and urging a return to "offline-first" and decentralized communication tools to bypass state control—a proposal met with mixed reactions regarding its practicality. Other users debated the statistical plausibility of the numbers by comparing them to historical events like the Dresden bombing, with some arguing that crowd density makes such casualty counts possible. Finally, there is a minor thread debating the authenticity of leaked videos, with some alleging manipulation while others point to the difficulty of getting footage out of the country.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 263 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article, authored by MP Zarah Sultana, argues that Palantir Technologies has no place in UK public services, particularly within the Ministry of Defence. It contends that Palantir's origins in US intelligence and its controversial work with immigration enforcement and military contracts make it incompatible with democratic values and public interest. The piece calls for the UK government to reject contracts with Palantir and other US big tech firms that prioritize profit and surveillance over civil liberties, advocating for sovereign, ethical alternatives.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but expands the critique beyond Palantir to the broader ecosystem of US big tech and the UK's surveillance infrastructure. A dominant theme is that the issue is systemic rather than vendor-specific; multiple commenters argue that the UK is entrenched in a "surveillance state" and that replacing Palantir with another contractor (like Amazon, Microsoft, or Google) would not address the underlying political will for mass data collection. Several users express a bleak outlook, suggesting it may be "too late" to reverse this trend.

The conversation also delves into the nature of the threat, framing it as an "oligarchy vs. the people" battle where corporate interests, particularly from the US, have undue influence over public services. There is a strong sentiment that true change requires electing representatives who prioritize citizens over "monied interests."

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the credibility of the article's author, Zarah Sultana. One commenter dismisses her as a "racist conspiracy theorist," linking to sources to support this claim, while others express skepticism about such accusations, viewing them as partisan "mudslinging" common in politically charged debates.

Finally, the discussion touches on practical alternatives and the scope of the problem. While some point to emerging European alternatives to US tech, others argue that the entire Western big tech ecosystem is compromised and that a gradual, strategic decoupling from the most critical services is necessary. The thread concludes with a sense of futility and cynicism, with comments noting the irony of discussing sovereignty on platforms hosted by US tech giants and the difficulty of enacting change in a political climate where protest is increasingly restricted.

## [Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46751826

> **Article:** The article "Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes" serves as a guide to understanding how indexes work in PostgreSQL. It covers fundamental concepts such as the structure of B-tree indexes, the mechanics of index scans, and the trade-offs involved in index creation. The piece explains how to choose appropriate columns for indexing to optimize query performance and discusses the impact of indexes on write operations. It aims to provide a practical foundation for developers looking to improve database efficiency without delving too deeply into internal complexities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article as a solid introduction, with several users pointing to external resources for deeper learning. The "Use the Index, Luke" website is repeatedly recommended as a go-to resource for B-tree index optimization, and users also praised the official PostgreSQL documentation for its readability.

A technical debate emerged regarding multi-column indexes. One user questioned whether the traditional rule—that an index requires a query on its leftmost column—still holds true in modern PostgreSQL versions. A responder clarified that while older versions could technically use such indexes via inefficient full scans, PostgreSQL 18 introduces "index skip scan," a more efficient mechanism that allows the database to skip over index entries that don't match the query criteria. Another user noted that in the absence of skip scans, a bitmap index scan might be used, but it is less performant than a direct index scan because it requires rechecking conditions on the fetched pages.

The conversation also touched on advanced database features. One user expressed a desire for built-in incremental view maintenance (IVM) in PostgreSQL, which automatically updates materialized views as underlying data changes. Commenters noted that IVM is a complex problem, especially regarding transactional consistency, and listed several external projects and extensions (such as pg_ivm and TimescaleDB's continuous aggregates) that attempt to solve this challenge.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 235 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The White House altered an arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney, to make it appear she was sobbing during a protest against ICE. The official X account posted the manipulated image, which was later defended by a deputy communications director with the statement "the memes will continue." The article highlights this as a rapid and unapologetic use of generative AI for political propaganda.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the implications of the White House's actions, the role of AI in politics, and the broader state of US democracy. Key themes included:

*   **Erosion of Truth and Credibility:** Many commenters viewed the incident as a deliberate strategy to undermine factual objectivity. Rather than asserting a specific truth, the administration is accused of fostering a "post-truth" environment where the goal is to make the concept of truth seem unknowable, thereby discouraging challenges to preconceived notions. The White House's shameless admission and dismissal of fact-checkers were cited as evidence of this strategy.

*   **Weaponization of AI:** The event was seen as a confirmation of fears that generative AI would be quickly weaponized for political propaganda. Users expressed a growing sense of skepticism and paranoia, noting that their first reaction to any interesting video or image is now to question its authenticity. Some argued that the primary driver for AI development is narrative control.

*   **Political Polarization and Apathy:** A significant portion of the discussion centered on the political divide. Commenters expressed despair over the state of US democracy, while others argued that the administration's base is indifferent to such actions. The debate extended to whether online comments are a reliable indicator of public opinion, with some cautioning against it.

*   **Legal and Social Consequences:** The potential for a defamation lawsuit was discussed, though commenters were pessimistic about its success, citing potential Supreme Court immunity. The incident also spurred calls for non-violent protest, boycotts of corporate supporters, and political action to counter the administration's agenda.

*   **Societal Impact:** The conversation concluded with a broader critique of generative AI's societal cost, suggesting that while it offers creative tools for individuals, it is ultimately dissolving social trust and creating collective action problems.

## [Yes, It's Fascism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46757822

> **Article:** The article from The Atlantic argues that the current political climate and actions of the Trump administration, particularly regarding ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), constitute fascism. It draws direct parallels between modern American events and historical fascist regimes, specifically citing the use of state-sanctioned violence, the lack of due process, and the administration's rhetoric in justifying these actions. The piece posits that these are not isolated incidents but part of a systemic shift towards authoritarianism, characterized by the empowerment of a militarized agency acting with impunity and the ideological framing of opponents as existential threats.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the validity of the "fascism" label and the severity of the current political situation. A significant portion of the commenters strongly agree with the article's premise, drawing explicit parallels between ICE and historical paramilitary groups like the Nazi Brownshirts. They express deep concern over reported ICE killings, viewing them as extrajudicial executions and a sign of escalating state violence. This group often cites historical precedents and political theory, such as Umberto Eco's "Ur-fascism," to support their analysis.

Conversely, several users express skepticism or outright rejection of the "fascism" label. One prominent viewpoint argues that the term has been overused for years, leading to "semantic satiation" where it has lost its impact. This commenter points to past predictions of fascism that did not result in an authoritarian state, suggesting the current warnings are another instance of alarmism. Another skeptic suggests the issues stem from poor training and a lack of accountability within ICE rather than a coherent fascist ideology.

The discussion also explores the potential trajectory of these events. Some commenters debate whether a peaceful resolution is possible or if armed conflict is inevitable. There is also a focus on the future, questioning whether these policies are a temporary phenomenon tied to a specific leader or a permanent normalization of executive power, drawing comparisons to the post-9/11 expansion of government authority. Finally, a few comments touch on the practicalities of the situation, such as the difficulty of accessing the article and the perceived lack of widespread public demonstrations.

## [Second Win11 emergency out of band update to address disastrous Patch Tuesday](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-second-emergency-out-of-band-update-kb5078127-released-address-outlook-bugs)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46750358

> **Article:** Microsoft released a second emergency "out-of-band" update (KB5078127) for Windows 11 to fix critical bugs introduced in the previous Patch Tuesday. The primary issue addressed was a significant malfunction in Microsoft Outlook, which was preventing users from accessing their email and calendars. This follows a pattern of recent updates causing widespread stability issues, highlighting a perceived decline in the quality control of Windows updates.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Microsoft's current approach to Windows development and quality assurance. Commenters attribute the frequent bugs and system sluggishness to several factors: the use of web technologies like React in core OS components (such as the Start Menu), a reliance on "AI slop" or "vibe coding" for development, and general software bloat.

Many users shared personal anecdotes of performance degradation, noting that Windows 11 feels significantly slower than previous versions, even on capable hardware. A common theme is the frustration with specific broken features, like the Start Menu search, which has led users to seek third-party alternatives like PowerToys.

The sentiment has driven some users to explore alternatives. Several commenters mentioned switching to Linux distributions like Fedora or Debian, praising them for being more stable, responsive, and respectful of hardware resources. Others are choosing to remain on the older, soon-to-be-unsupported Windows 10, with some noting the availability of the LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) version for extended stability. The overall tone is one of exhaustion and a loss of faith in Microsoft's ability to deliver a reliable operating system.

## [Nvidia-smi hangs indefinitely after ~66 days](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/971)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46750425

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules repository where users report that `nvidia-smi` and GPU jobs hang indefinitely after exactly 66 days and 14 hours of system uptime. The problem appears to affect B200 GPUs using NVLink, with errors like "postRxDetLinkMask" appearing before the crash. A full cluster restart is required to resolve the issue. The community speculates that the cause is likely a 32-bit integer overflow in a time or counter variable related to the NVLink driver, given the precise timing of the failure.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around diagnosing the root cause of the 66-day hang, with the leading theory being a classic integer overflow. Users note that the specific duration (approximately 66.6 days) strongly suggests a 32-bit counter overflowing, likely tracking time in milliseconds or seconds. Several commenters shared their own experiences with similar long-term uptime bugs, such as a Raspberry Pi USB stack failing after a week due to a kernel memory leak and a National Instruments driver failing every 31 days due to a Windows timer overflow. These anecdotes highlighted the immense difficulty of debugging issues with long trigger times and the creative workarounds required when fixes aren't immediately available.

Technical advice was also offered, with one user pointing out the importance of using kernel macros like `time_before()` instead of direct timestamp comparisons to avoid rollover bugs. A humorous observation noted that an internal NVIDIA bug number assigned to the issue coincidentally matched the number of seconds in the failure window. On a tangential note, the community also briefly discussed the ethics of using AI to generate bug report comments, after one user admitted to doing so out of laziness.

## [FAA institutes nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE operations](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/faa-drone-no-fly-zone-ice-dhs)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46755999

> **Article:** The FAA has instituted nationwide drone no-fly zones around ICE and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operations. Unlike traditional Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs), these restrictions are mobile and do not provide specific geographic coordinates, activation times, or public notifications. The no-fly zone creates a 3,000-foot lateral and 1,000-foot vertical bubble around moving DHS assets, such as ground vehicle convoys. This means a drone operator flying legally in a public area could unknowingly enter restricted airspace if a DHS convoy passes nearby.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the policy, framing it as a tool for government overreach and a hallmark of authoritarianism. Commenters argue that the lack of specific coordinates makes it impossible for drone operators to comply, effectively turning a common activity into a crime that can be selectively enforced. There is concern that this policy is designed to chill public oversight and recording of government operations, particularly by ICE.

Key points of debate include:
*   **Vagueness and Enforcement:** Users compare the rule to unconstitutionally vague laws, such as "reasonable and prudent" speed limits. They argue that the inability to know where the "no-fly zone" is at any given moment makes compliance impossible and allows for arbitrary enforcement.
*   **Surveillance and Tracking:** Some suggest the policy is a way to identify and penalize drone operators who record DHS activities, as modern drones often broadcast identification data linked to the owner. However, others note that it's trivial to build a non-tracking drone.
*   **Practicality and Scope:** The rule's broad application to all DHS "mobile assets" (not just ICE) raises questions about how an operator could possibly identify such assets, especially when they are unmarked or concealed (e.g., in a rental car).
*   **Technical Evasion:** A few commenters discussed the technical feasibility of bypassing drone restrictions, noting that some DJI drones may have ways to disable geofencing, though this was disputed by owners.
*   **Potential for Escalation:** One user speculated that the NOTAM could be a precursor to authorizing the jamming or destruction of drones that enter the restricted airspace.

**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46749053

> **Article:** The article from Eclypsium details a hardware teardown of a suspicious USB-A to USB-C cable purchased from Amazon. The analysis compares this cable against a known genuine FTDI-based cable. The "suspicious" cable was identified as a counterfeit due to its significantly simpler internal construction: it lacked the expected FTDI USB-to-serial bridge controller chip and supporting components (such as a voltage regulator and crystal oscillator), instead relying on a single, cheaper integrated circuit to handle the data lines. The article highlights that while this specific counterfeit cable appeared to be a low-effort clone intended to function merely as a basic USB cable, the physical concealment within a standard housing poses a significant security risk, as it could easily be modified to act as a malicious "drop box" or keylogger without visual detection.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around the broader security implications of hardware supply chain attacks and the reputation of FTDI as a brand. Commenters expressed concern over the prevalence of "O.MG" style cables—malicious USB cables containing hidden implants capable of wireless control—which are marketed to both offensive security teams and potential adversaries. There was a consensus that the physical indistinguishability of these compromised cables from legitimate ones makes them a serious threat.

Regarding FTDI specifically, the sentiment was largely negative. Users recalled FTDI's controversial history of using driver updates to brick counterfeit chips, which led many to distrust the brand and switch to alternative manufacturers (such as those producing CH340 chips) or build their own solutions using standard microcontrollers. Several participants noted that USB-to-serial communication is a "solved problem" and that FTDI no longer holds a monopoly on reliable hardware.

Finally, the conversation touched on advanced persistent threats at the hardware level. One user detailed a personal project to simulate a supply chain attack by replacing a motherboard's PCH with an "unfused" chip sourced from third-party marketplaces to bypass security features like Boot Guard. Others suggested alternative attack vectors, such as compromising firmware on NICs, BMCs, or SSDs, or utilizing the Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) to persist malware through BIOS/UEFI reflashing.

## [Two Weeks Until Tapeout](https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46749671

> **Article:** The article "Two Weeks Until Tapeout" is a personal blog post detailing the author's experience participating in the Tiny Tapeout project, specifically using GlobalFoundries' 180nm process on a free experimental shuttle. The author describes the intense, time-constrained process of designing a custom JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) TAP (Test Access Port) controller. A significant challenge highlighted is the inaccessibility of the official IEEE JTAG specification due to its paywall, which forced the author to rely on alternative resources and creative verification methods. The post captures the excitement and pressure of moving from digital design to a physical silicon chip on a tight deadline, emphasizing the accessibility of chip fabrication for hobbyists through initiatives like Tiny Tapeout.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with commenters expressing admiration for the author's project and the niche field of hardware design. A recurring theme was the contrast between the vast world of hardware engineering and the more commonly discussed domain of full-stack web development. Several users engaged with the technical and logistical aspects of the project:

*   **Open-Source Tools:** A key point of interest was the availability of open-source tools for chip design. One commenter confirmed that the entire Tiny Tapeout project roadmap can be completed using open-source tools, a sentiment supported by another user (a PhD student) who noted that open-source EDA tools are becoming increasingly viable, especially with the emergence of open PDKs.
*   **Industry Perspective:** A professional with 30 years of experience in physical design shared a more sobering view of the industry, describing the grueling 80-100 hour work weeks common before a tapeout deadline. This provided a stark contrast to the hobbyist experience, though another commenter noted that similar high-pressure deadlines exist in software.
*   **Project Examples & Limitations:** Users shared examples of other interesting projects from the Tiny Tapeout platform, particularly sound generators. A discussion point raised was the commercial viability of designs made on such platforms, with one user expressing surprise that SRAMs are considered a "luxury" item in this context, as they are essential for most commercial applications.
*   **Writing Style:** The author's engaging and humorous writing style was frequently praised, making the complex technical subject matter more accessible and entertaining for a broad audience.

## [Show HN: Bonsplit – Tabs and splits for native macOS apps](https://bonsplit.alasdairmonk.com)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46753301

> **Project:** Bonsplit is a native macOS library for developers that adds tab and split pane functionality to their applications. It provides a polished, customizable UI for managing multiple views within a single window, similar to the "Origami" mode in Sublime Text. The project is presented with a highly polished website that serves as its documentation and demo.
>
> **Discussion:** The reaction to Bonsplit was largely positive, with users praising the library's aesthetic polish and the quality of its website. However, the discussion revealed some initial confusion about the project's scope. Several commenters mistakenly assumed it was a system-wide utility that would add tabs to all native macOS apps, rather than a developer library. This led to a brief but notable thread about the limitations of Apple's native AppKit tabbing API, which operates at the window level and may not offer the granular control that some applications require.

Beyond the initial confusion, developers appreciated the library's functionality, comparing its visual style to Sublime Text's tiling features. The conversation also touched on the effort invested in the project's presentation, with commenters admiring the high-quality website as a benchmark for documentation. A minor point of feedback was a request for a "tear-off" tab feature to detach panes into new windows.

## [OnePlus update blocks downgrades and custom ROMs by blowing a fuse](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Oneplus_phone_update_introduces_hardware_anti-rollback)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46757944

> **Article:** An article on Consumer Rights Wiki reports that OnePlus has introduced a hardware-based anti-rollback mechanism in a recent update for certain phone models. This update utilizes a physical "fuse" within the device's processor (likely an eFuse in the Qualcomm hardware). Once the device is updated to the new firmware version, the fuse is permanently blown, preventing the user from downgrading the operating system or installing custom ROMs that are built on older firmware versions. The mechanism works by having the bootloader check the current fuse value against the firmware version; if the firmware version is lower, the boot process is rejected.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the OnePlus update centers on the motivations behind the move, the technical nature of eFuses, and the broader implications for device ownership and the right to repair.

A primary theme is the debate over why OnePlus implemented this change. Several users speculate that it is a security measure to prevent the bypassing of theft-protection locks, noting that a vulnerability was discovered allowing stolen devices to be re-enabled. Others, however, view it as an anti-consumer tactic designed to prevent users from downgrading to older, potentially faster firmware or from using custom ROMs, thereby forcing them to accept whatever software updates the manufacturer pushes, even if they degrade performance.

The technical aspects of the "fuse" were also clarified. Commenters explained that eFuses are not unique to OnePlus; they are a standard hardware feature in many modern System-on-Chips (SoCs), including those made by Qualcomm. They are typically used for storing cryptographic keys and ensuring rollback prevention. Users drew parallels to Apple's iPhones, which achieve a similar result through software signatures rather than a physical fuse, making downgrades impossible after a certain period.

Finally, the conversation expanded to the philosophical and legal rights of the consumer. Many commenters expressed frustration that such measures undermine the concept of true ownership, arguing that if a manufacturer can arbitrarily restrict software functionality post-purchase, the device is more akin to a rental than a product owned outright. This led to broader discussions about the "right to repair" and the control manufacturers exert over hardware long after it has been sold.

## [First, make me care](https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46757067

> **Article:** The article "First, make me care" argues that the most critical task for any writer is to immediately capture the reader's attention and establish relevance. It posits that before an audience will invest time in details, data, or narrative, the content must first provide a compelling "hook" or emotional stake. The piece likely explores techniques for creating these engaging openings, contrasting them with dry, detail-heavy starts that fail to connect with readers on a human level. The core thesis is that engagement must precede education.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's central premise but complicates it by examining audience, medium, and intent. A primary tension exists between "technical" and "general" audiences; commenters note that while a broad audience needs a hook to care, technical readers often prefer immediate, substantive details and can be alienated by narrative fluff. This leads to a debate on writing styles: one school advocates for "making me care" through narrative hooks to maximize engagement and page impressions, while the other prefers to "just start with the interesting part first" by clearly stating the article's purpose, valuing honesty and efficiency over persuasion.

The conversation extends beyond traditional writing to modern content platforms. TikTok is presented as the ultimate "brute-force" environment for this principle, where creators have only seconds to hook viewers, leading to a constant evolution of psychological tactics. However, this is criticized by some as a "tarpit" that trains short attention spans and devalues content that requires patience to appreciate, a point illustrated by a user's preference for SiriusXM's non-skippable format which allowed them to discover songs they would have otherwise skipped.

Ultimately, the comments suggest that while the hook is vital, it must be part of a complete package. A good hook is wasted if the article fails to deliver on its promise, and the choice of hook must be tailored to the specific audience's expectations and tolerance for narrative. The debate also touches on the potential for AI to generate hooks and the philosophical role of mystery in storytelling, with users split on whether mystery is an engaging puzzle or an irritating narrative obstruction.
