## [Man shot and killed by federal agents in south Minneapolis this morning](https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426)
**Score:** 413 | **Comments:** 408 | **ID:** 46745047

> **Article:** The article reports that a man was shot and killed by federal agents (ICE) during an operation in south Minneapolis. The incident is described as occurring during a raid, with the article providing the basic facts of the shooting and the official response from authorities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the federal agents' actions and expresses deep concern over the state of civil liberties and federal authority. The conversation can be summarized into several key themes:

**Interpretation of the Incident**
Commenters widely view the shooting as an unjustified "summary execution" or "brownshirt" tactic, citing video evidence that appears to show the individual pinned down by multiple agents before being shot. There is skepticism toward the official narrative that the victim was armed or posed a lethal threat, with many noting the lack of bodycam footage and the difficulty of perceiving a threat while being restrained.

**Political and Institutional Context**
The discussion places the event within a broader political framework, linking it to the Trump administration's policies and rhetoric. Users characterize ICE recruitment as drawing from white nationalist circles and view the shooting as part of a systemic effort to intimidate immigrant communities, specifically referencing Minnesota's large Somali population. There is significant distrust in the Department of Justice and FBI's ability to conduct an impartial investigation, with commenters predicting that state-level authorities will have to pursue justice due to federal obstruction.

**Legal and Practical Responses**
Users debated the legal power of state and local governments to resist or expel federal agents. While acknowledging the legal complexities and risks of federal escalation, some proposed economic measures to "deplatform" federal agents within the state, such as denying them commercial services (food, fuel, lodging). The conversation highlights a perceived breakdown in the traditional balance of power between federal and state governments.

**Community Reaction and Censorship**
There is a recurring sentiment that the event is being suppressed or ignored by mainstream channels. Users noted that the thread was quickly flagged on Hacker News, leading to accusations of censorship and directing users to the "/active" view to see unfiltered content. The tone of the comments is one of alarm and urgency, with users arguing that such events have more significant societal implications than typical technology policy issues often discussed on the site.

## [Doing gigabit Ethernet over my British phone wires](https://thehftguy.com/2026/01/22/doing-gigabit-ethernet-over-my-british-phone-wires/)
**Score:** 411 | **Comments:** 232 | **ID:** 46742362

> **Article:** The author describes achieving gigabit Ethernet speeds (940 Mbps) over existing British telephone wiring (twisted pair) using G.hn technology adapters. Faced with the inability to run new Ethernet cables and a lack of gigabit ports on available devices, they purchased a pair of G.hn adapters. These devices modulate network data onto high frequencies (up to 200 MHz) over the existing copper lines. The author details the setup process, the performance results, and the limitations, such as the need to purchase the adapters from Europe due to Brexit-related import complexities. The post concludes that this technology is a viable, high-performance solution for retrofitting British homes with gigabit networking without invasive construction.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's technical achievement while exploring the nuances of the technology and the broader context of UK networking.

Technically, commenters confirm that G.hn chipsets are sophisticated enough to handle the poor signal integrity typical of household telephone wiring. They utilize OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) to map the channel and dynamically avoid frequencies affected by signal reflections from bridge taps or unused sockets. Several users noted that standard twisted pair phone wiring (often Cat5e or better) is inherently capable of carrying gigabit signals over short distances, even without G.hn, provided all four pairs are connected.

The conversation also touched on the author's specific constraints. Some debated the claim that gigabit internet is unavailable in the UK, with London-based users noting they have had fiber for years, suggesting the author's issue was likely with building infrastructure rather than ISP availability. Others pointed out that modern Wi-Fi 7 can exceed gigabit speeds, questioning the necessity of a wired solution for general use, though low latency for gaming was cited as a valid reason for preferring wired connections.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the practicalities of UK home networking. Several users shared their own experiences running new Cat5e/Cat6 cables through walls, often using old phone wires as pull strings. There was skepticism about the market size for G.hn adapters, as most technical users would likely opt to install new cabling for future-proofing. Finally, a tangent regarding Brexit emerged, with users criticizing the bureaucratic hurdles and import fees involved in purchasing the hardware from Europe.

## [MS confirms it will give the FBI your Windows PC data encryption key if asked](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-bitlocker-encryption-keys-give-fbi-legal-order-privacy-nightmare)
**Score:** 404 | **Comments:** 266 | **ID:** 46743154

> **Article:** The article reports that Microsoft's BitLocker encryption for Windows can back up device encryption keys to a user's Microsoft account by default. This means that with a legal order, such as an FBI warrant, Microsoft can provide these keys to law enforcement, potentially decrypting the device's data. The piece frames this as a significant privacy concern, contrasting it with other systems like Linux where keys are typically stored only locally. It also touches upon similar practices by other tech giants like Apple, especially concerning iCloud backups of encryption keys.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community that is largely unsurprised by Microsoft's policy, viewing it as a long-standing reality of corporate data handling. The conversation quickly pivots from the initial news to broader themes of user responsibility and platform alternatives.

A dominant sentiment is that users should have anticipated this, with commenters noting that corporations will always comply with legal orders and that being "surprised" is delusional. This leads to a strong push for user-controlled solutions. Many users recommend switching to Linux, where disk encryption keys are stored locally and are not backed up to the cloud, or using third-party tools like VeraCrypt for more secure, user-managed encryption. There's also a nostalgic and somewhat suspicious mention of TrueCrypt's discontinuation and its recommendation to users to migrate to BitLocker.

The discussion also expands to other major platforms. While some users claim Apple would behave similarly, others point out that Apple offers an "Advanced Data Protection" feature for end-to-end encryption and that iCloud itself is protected by hardware security modules, suggesting the situation is more nuanced. The debate touches on password managers and authenticator apps, with a consensus forming that users should choose services that are end-to-end encrypted and for which the provider does not hold the decryption key.

Finally, a philosophical debate emerges about the role of corporations and the law. One user argues that no organization should be beyond the law's reach, while others counter that this doesn't necessitate companies holding "master keys" to user data. A sarcastic comment about "encryption-neutrality" highlights the community's general agreement that securing one's own data is a personal responsibility.

## [How I estimate work](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/)
**Score:** 377 | **Comments:** 233 | **ID:** 46742389

> **Article:** The article "How I Estimate Work" by Sean Goedecke presents a pragmatic approach to software estimation, arguing that engineers should embrace estimation as a core part of their job rather than resisting it. The author's method involves first understanding the business's desired timeline (the "range") and then working backward to identify a technical solution that fits within that constraint. This reframes estimation from a predictive science to a negotiation process: the engineer's role is to find the best possible technical approach that delivers value within the given timeframe, rather than providing an "accurate" but potentially useless number. Goedecke emphasizes that refusing to estimate simply forces non-technical stakeholders to make their own, likely worse, estimates.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing war stories and reinforcing the idea that estimation is a political and communicative skill as much as a technical one. A dominant theme is the inherent inaccuracy of software estimates and the coping mechanisms engineers develop. Several long-time developers shared "old school" advice, such as multiplying initial estimates by pi or a large constant (e.g., doubling twice), highlighting a deep-seated cultural cynicism born from experience with unexpected delays and unknown unknowns.

Commenters also explored the business pressures behind estimation. One key point was that sales and business teams need dates to close deals and manage customer expectations, creating a top-down demand for timelines that engineers must engage with. The alternative—refusing to provide an estimate—is seen as forcing less technical people to guess, which is often more detrimental. The discussion also touched on practical techniques, like the "tracer bullet" approach (building a thin end-to-end prototype to uncover risks early) and the importance of tracking past estimates to improve accuracy over time. Ultimately, the consensus aligns with the article: estimation is an unavoidable, judgment-based art that is crucial for effective collaboration and delivering value in a business context.

## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 341 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** BirdyChat, a chat application from Latvia, has announced it is the first European app to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp. This is enabled by the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU, which mandates that gatekeepers like Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) open their services to third parties. The feature allows BirdyChat users in the European Economic Area (EEA) to start chats with WhatsApp users in the region using only their phone number. The announcement is positioned as a significant step towards breaking down the "walled gardens" of proprietary messaging platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and critical of the announcement, focusing on the limitations of the implementation and the broader context of proprietary vs. open protocols.

A central theme is the criticism of WhatsApp's "opt-in" requirement for users to receive messages from other apps. Commenters argue this is a major hurdle that could render the feature "dead in the water," as it places the burden of discovery and activation on the user, rather than enabling seamless cross-app communication. This is seen as a form of "malicious compliance" by Meta, allowing them to technically fulfill DMA requirements without genuinely opening their network.

Many commenters express a deeper frustration with the proprietary nature of modern chat applications. They contrast the current situation with the "golden age" of open internet protocols like IRC and XMPP, where anyone could write a client and achieve interoperability. The consensus is that while open standards are technically superior, they have lost out to closed platforms because users prioritize the features and network effects of apps like WhatsApp and iMessage over the freedom of open protocols.

There is also significant discussion about the Digital Markets Act itself. Some hope this precedent will force Apple to open up iMessage, but others point out that iMessage has received an exemption in the EU, meaning it is not currently required to interoperate. A minor point of debate arises when a commenter incorrectly claims iMessage is already open via SMS, which is corrected by others.

Finally, there is a cynical view regarding the specific apps chosen by Meta for this initial interoperability. One commenter alleges that BirdyChat and another app, Haiket, are obscure, potentially non-existent products with ties to Meta, suggesting they were hand-picked to create the appearance of compliance without enabling real competition from established third-party apps.

## [Comma openpilot – Open source driver-assistance](https://comma.ai)
**Score:** 332 | **Comments:** 196 | **ID:** 46740029

> **Article:** The article links to comma.ai, the website for Comma AI, a company that develops openpilot, an open-source driver-assistance system. openpilot is a software-based alternative to factory-installed advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), offering features like adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist for a wide range of compatible vehicles. The system typically uses a comma device (like the Comma 3X) which connects to the car's internal network to augment its existing capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising Comma AI for its impressive technology, open-source nature, and value as an alternative to expensive, subscription-based manufacturer systems. Many commenters are current or prospective users who appreciate the product's ability to enhance their driving experience, particularly on long road trips or in stop-and-go traffic.

A key theme is the contrast between Comma AI and other self-driving initiatives, particularly Tesla's. Commenters describe Comma's CEO, George Hotz (geohot), as an "anti-Elon Musk" figure, valuing his contrary attitude and the company's transparent, open-source approach. The discussion clarifies that openpilot is not a full self-driving (FSD) system but rather an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) that requires driver attention. Users note that while the base software is excellent for lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control, community forks like Sunnypilot can offer additional features.

Several practical concerns and questions were raised:
*   **Vehicle Compatibility:** A frequent point of discussion is which vehicles are supported, with users expressing hope for more brands (like Opel and Mitsubishi) and future models (like the Slate pickup).
*   **User Experience:** A new user asked for a concrete explanation of what the system does, which the community answered by clarifying its ADAS capabilities versus full autonomy.
*   **Insurance and Liability:** One commenter raised concerns about insurance ramifications in case of an accident, questioning who would be liable. The consensus was that the driver remains responsible and must always be attentive, similar to using Tesla's Autopilot.
*   **Company Culture:** There was a brief mention of Comma's unique hiring process, with a current employee clarifying that interviews are "relatively chill" and hiring is done through a public leaderboard, countering a rumor about difficult interview questions.

## [Claude Code's new hidden feature: Swarms](https://twitter.com/NicerInPerson/status/2014989679796347375)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46743908

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet revealing a hidden "Swarms" feature in the latest builds of Anthropic's Claude Code CLI. The feature allows for multi-agent delegation, where a main "team lead" agent can spawn sub-agents to work on specific tasks in parallel. It is currently disabled behind a feature flag that checks a user's account permissions. However, the community discovered that the flag can be bypassed by patching the CLI's JavaScript file to remove the backend check. A GitHub repository was shared containing a script to enable this hidden functionality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the technical implementation, security implications, and practical utility of the hidden swarm feature.

A primary technical concern was security. One commenter highlighted that a popular third-party tool designed to enable similar swarm capabilities, claude-flow, uses OpenTelemetry that captures complete session histories (including secrets and proprietary code) and exports them to potentially attacker-controlled endpoints. This raised alarms about the risks of using third-party tools that require deep access to AI assistant configurations and data.

Users debated the utility of swarm modes. While some argued that delegation leads to more efficient token usage and better reasoning due to fresh context windows for sub-agents, others felt it would lead to an overwhelming amount of code that is difficult to maintain. A recurring joke was the idea of a "Principal Engineer" delegating a simple task, like "make this button red," to an entire swarm of agents, highlighting the potential for over-engineering.

The feature itself was compared to existing open-source projects like GSD and claude-flow. The consensus was that while third-party tools exist, the "first-party" integration into the Claude Code harness offers distinct advantages in reliability and future support. Several users noted that similar swarm-like behaviors are already observable in the Claude Desktop app, suggesting this is an evolution of existing capabilities rather than a completely new concept.

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes how the author, Micah Cantor, added a comment section to his static blog by leveraging Bluesky. Instead of building a custom commenting system, he embeds a Bluesky "feed" or "thread" into his blog posts. This feed is filtered to show only posts that contain a specific link back to the blog post's URL. The result is a functional, decentralized comment section where readers can interact via their Bluesky accounts, and the comments are displayed directly on the blog. The author presents this as a simple, effective solution that offloads the complexity of moderation, user accounts, and real-time infrastructure to an existing social network.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was largely positive, with users praising the creativity and simplicity of the implementation. Several commenters shared their own similar projects, such as using Cloudflare Workers to send comments to a static site's markdown files or creating geo-mapping blogs that pull from social media posts. The idea of using an external platform for comments sparked a broader debate on the trade-offs between convenience and long-term sustainability. One user detailed the extensive requirements for a tech tutorial blog (code blocks, screenshots, spam management, etc.), explaining why they stick with Disqus despite its flaws, highlighting the difficulty of finding a perfect, self-hosted solution. A minor point of contention arose regarding Bluesky's long-term viability as a for-profit platform, with some users expressing skepticism about building on a service that could eventually enshittify, while others defended the practical value of such "temporary compromises." A moderator intervened to remind a user to provide a more substantive critique rather than a shallow dismissal.

## [I Like GitLab](https://www.whileforloop.com/en/blog/2026/01/21/i-like-gitlab/)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46742432

> **Article:** The article "I Like GitLab" is a personal endorsement of the GitLab platform. The author details their positive experience, likely highlighting GitLab's all-in-one nature that integrates source code management (SCM), CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and other DevOps tools into a single application. The piece probably contrasts this unified approach with the more fragmented experience of assembling separate tools, and frames GitLab as a robust and comprehensive solution for both individual and team use.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a nuanced view of GitLab, largely agreeing with the article's positive sentiment but with significant caveats, especially regarding self-hosting and performance.

The consensus is that GitLab is a powerful, feature-rich platform, particularly praised for its integrated and user-friendly CI/CD, which many prefer over Jenkins. Its comprehensive, all-in-one nature is seen as a major strength, especially for companies that want a single, self-hosted solution for their entire DevOps workflow.

However, a dominant counter-theme is GitLab's resource intensity and performance. Several commenters who self-host describe it as a "monster" that demands significant server resources and can feel slow, especially the web interface for merge requests. This has led many users with simpler needs to migrate to lighter, more performant alternatives like Forgejo or Gitea, which are written in Go and offer a much faster experience with a fraction of the resource footprint.

A secondary point of criticism revolves around product management. Users report encountering long-standing, unfixed bugs (some several years old) and features that feel incomplete or stuck in an "80/20" state. Furthermore, the discussion highlights that many essential enterprise features (like advanced approval rules, merge trains, and AI tools) are locked behind expensive premium subscriptions, which can be a deal-breaker for individuals or smaller teams. Ultimately, the discussion portrays GitLab as a powerful but heavy-duty tool, with a growing number of users opting for more lightweight and agile forks like Forgejo for personal or less demanding use cases.

**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46745944

> **Article:** A federal agent shot and killed a person in Minneapolis during an immigration enforcement operation, according to a Time.com article. The incident occurred as federal agents were conducting an operation targeting individuals with deportation orders. The article reports that the individual was armed and fired at agents, who returned fire. This event is part of an ongoing immigration crackdown in the area. The identity of the deceased has not been released, and an investigation is underway.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is minimal because the comments were moved to a previous thread about the same incident. The original post linked in the comments (item 46745047) contains the active discussion. Key themes from that earlier discussion include debates over the use of force by federal agents, the broader context of immigration enforcement policies, and concerns about transparency in such operations. Users also discussed the reliability of news sources and the potential for bias in reporting on immigration-related incidents.

## [Minnesota activist releases arrest video after manipulated White House version](https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-activist-ice-protest-church-video-49faf3efd54e496388651aac1369fb44)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46739638

> **Article:** The Associated Press article reports that a Minnesota activist, Jarryd Hayne (referred to as Levy Armstrong in the AP fact-check), released the original arrest video after discovering the White House had published a manipulated version of it. The White House's edit, shared on social media, allegedly altered the activist's appearance by darkening their skin tone and exaggerating facial features to make them appear more threatening. The article presents a side-by-side comparison of the original and manipulated footage, confirming the significant visual differences.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the implications of the White House's manipulation of the video and the broader erosion of trust in digital media. Commenters immediately noted the racial undertones of the edit, specifically the darkening of the subject's skin. Several users expressed cynicism regarding the effectiveness of corrections; they argued that once a manipulated image is seen, it leaves a lasting impression, and subsequent retractions rarely reach the same audience or undo the initial emotional impact.

The conversation expanded to critique the political strategy behind such actions. One user suggested the White House deliberately uses social media to frame official communications as "memes," providing plausible deniability and a "fig leaf" to avoid accountability for spreading misinformation. There was also a discussion on technical solutions to verify media authenticity, such as camera signing standards like C2PA, though skepticism remained about whether bad actors could bypass these measures or if adoption would be widespread enough to matter. Ultimately, the consensus among commenters was that this incident exemplifies a calculated political maneuver where the benefit of shaping a narrative outweighs the risk of being exposed.

## [Tao Te Ching – Translated by Ursula K. Le Guin](https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46745233

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub-hosted version of Ursula K. Le Guin’s "rendition" of the Tao Te Ching. Le Guin notes that this is not a direct translation, as she does not know Chinese, but rather a creative interpretation based on earlier translations. The text presents the philosophical verses of Lao Tzu through Le Guin's distinct literary voice.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community engaged with the post through several lenses: appreciation for Le Guin, the nature of translation, and the text's philosophical relevance.

A central theme was the distinction between translation and interpretation. Users noted that Le Guin herself calls this a "rendition," acknowledging her reliance on Paul Carus's 1898 work. Commenters debated the difficulty of translating the Tao Te Ching even for those fluent in Chinese, citing the controversial nature of the opening lines. The discussion expanded to the broader concept of translation, with one user likening it to musical "cover songs"—where different artists offer unique interpretations of the same source material.

There was significant praise for Le Guin’s literary style, with many users connecting the text's themes of quiet strength and non-action to her novels, particularly the *Earthsea* series. The Taoist concept of "low, quiet, and unseen" strength was highlighted as a counterpoint to American cultural values of dominance and self-assertion, resonating with several readers' personal experiences.

The conversation also touched on copyright ethics. While some users expressed concern over the GitHub file potentially violating Le Guin's copyright, others argued that the work is a derivative of a 2000-year-old text and that Le Guin’s estate should be supported by purchasing the official book.

Finally, the thread served as a resource hub, with users sharing links to other popular translations (such as Ken Liu's), a site for comparing multiple versions side-by-side, and references to pop culture interpretations like "The Tao of the Dude."

## [Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46742635

> **Article:** The article "Many Small Queries Are Efficient in SQLite" argues that for an embedded database, executing numerous small, separate queries can be more performant than a single, complex, monolithic query. The author (likely D. Richard Hipp, creator of SQLite) uses the Fossil SCM's timeline view as a case study. The key reason is that SQLite's overhead is primarily the function call boundary between the application and the database engine, which is negligible compared to the network latency inherent in client-server databases. Therefore, breaking logic into multiple simple queries allows the application to process data incrementally without the significant cost of network round-trips, making the "N+1 query problem" less of a concern for local SQLite usage.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the fundamental difference between embedded and networked databases. The core consensus is that SQLite's efficiency stems from its architecture: it runs within the same process and memory space as the application, eliminating network stack overhead, serialization, and inter-process communication that plague client-server models, even when the server is on localhost.

Key themes include:
*   **Context is Crucial:** Commenters distinguish between query types. While a single complex query is often better for analytical workloads (allowing the optimizer to find efficiencies), many small queries are ideal for transactional or record-retrieval tasks common in applications. The article's example is likened to making 200 HTTP GET requests versus one, where the overhead of each individual request is the real bottleneck.
*   **Scalability and Concurrency:** The main counterpoint is SQLite's limitation with high-write concurrency. While it excels at reads and single-writer scenarios, users noted that even modest concurrent write loads (e.g., from background workers) can cause contention and force a migration to a client-server database like PostgreSQL.
*   **Practical Application:** Several users shared positive experiences using SQLite for applications like paperless-ngx or in-browser databases (via WASM), confirming its performance is often more than sufficient. The discussion also highlighted architectural patterns like customer sharding (using a separate SQLite instance per customer) to achieve massive scale.
*   **Design Philosophy:** SQLite is framed as an "application file-format with a SQL interface." This encourages developers to design for its strengths from the start rather than prematurely optimizing for a networked database that may never be needed. The risk of vendor lock-in to a specific database pattern was noted, but the consensus was that for most applications, the simplicity and performance of SQLite make it the superior starting point.

## [“Let people help” – Advice that made a big difference to a grieving widow](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/20/nx-s1-5683170/let-them-the-small-bit-of-advice-that-made-a-big-difference-to-a-grieving-widow)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46740748

> **Article:** An NPR article recounts the experience of a widow who, after her husband's sudden death, was overwhelmed by the logistics of settling his estate. A simple piece of advice—"let people help"—transformed her grieving process. Instead of politely declining offers of support, she began accepting them, asking friends and acquaintances to handle specific tasks like making phone calls or researching information. This allowed her to navigate the emotional turmoil of grief without being crushed by administrative burdens, highlighting how accepting help is a gift to both the giver and the receiver.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the practical application of the article's advice and the cultural barriers to accepting help. Many commenters shared concrete examples of how to assist the bereaved, emphasizing proactive gestures like delivering pre-made meals or performing small chores (such as cleaning shoes) rather than asking the vague question, "How can I help?" This led to a broader conversation about the difficulty of asking for and receiving assistance. Several users shared the Jewish parable of the souls in Heaven and Hell, which was posted in the comments, to illustrate that community and mutual support are what make a difficult situation bearable, while isolation leads to suffering. The thread also touched on the emotional difficulty of maintaining support long after the initial tragedy, with one user questioning how long such help should continue. Finally, a few comments addressed the article itself, with one user expressing a desire for closure on a specific narrative thread and another appreciating the sharing of accessibility features like text-only links.

## [December in Servo: multiple windows, proxy support, better caching, and more](https://servo.org/blog/2026/01/23/december-in-servo/)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 11 | **ID:** 46745259

> **Article:** The article from the Servo project blog announces significant progress made in December, highlighting key developments such as support for multiple windows, proxy configuration, and improved caching mechanisms. These updates represent substantial steps in maturing Servo from an experimental engine into a more capable tool, potentially suitable for embedded use or as a standalone browser.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to Servo's progress, viewing it as a vital step toward diversifying the web engine landscape and reducing reliance on the dominant Blink/WebKit lineages. Commenters expressed optimism about Servo's potential as a sustainable, grassroots alternative to Mozilla's Firefox, particularly given their concerns regarding Mozilla's long-term corporate viability.

A significant portion of the discussion centered on a comparison between Servo and the Ladybird browser. Users noted that while Ladybird currently offers better web standards compliance (scoring over 500 on html5test), it is slower and requires building from source, whereas Servo provides prebuilt binaries and utilizes the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. Conversely, Ladybird uses its own engine (SerenityOS's LibWeb), which contributes to its correctness but impacts performance.

Finally, the conversation touched on the importance of public funding for independent browser development. Users highlighted that Servo has already received financial support from European entities, such as the German Sovereign Tech Agency and NLnet (funded by the EU), validating the idea that government grants can help sustain open-source alternatives to corporate-controlled engines.

## [Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807)
**Score:** 113 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46744807

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asks if others are experiencing issues with Gmail's spam filter suddenly and aggressively marking legitimate emails (like USPS notifications, HR emails, and system alerts) as spam or suspicious. They are seeking confirmation from the community and potential explanations for the change in behavior.
>
> **Discussion:** The community largely confirms the user's experience, describing a noticeable degradation in Gmail's filtering accuracy. Several distinct issues were reported: legitimate emails are being incorrectly flagged as "suspicious" or "unsafe," often with a warning that the message could not be scanned. There is also confusion regarding classification, with users noting that non-promotional emails are being routed to the "Promotions" tab and that "Priority Inbox" rules seem to have reset or stopped working. A specific technical observation was that emails are being delayed by 7–10 minutes.

Commenters offered several theories and solutions. One user explained that Google's filters are crowd-sourced, suggesting that marking these emails as "not suspicious" helps retrain the algorithm. Another user noted that the "unsafe" warnings often appear when Google is unable to scan a message, resulting in a disclaimer rather than a hard spam block. The discussion also touched on broader spam management strategies, with one user advising never to disclose one's primary email address, while others expressed frustration with the current state of email deliverability and notification reliability.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the practical utility and limitations of AI coding assistants, with a central tension between productivity gains and code quality/maintainability. While the video's title suggests a rejection of AI coding, the comments reflect a more nuanced, balanced view.

Most commenters acknowledge that AI tools are not yet capable of fully replacing human developers, especially for complex, critical, or performance-sensitive tasks. There is a strong consensus that developers must retain responsibility for the code they ship, as AI cannot be held accountable. Many highlight the risk of accumulating technical debt by shipping "vibe slop"—AI-generated code that may work but is poorly structured or understood.

However, the discussion also emphasizes the significant productivity benefits of using AI for specific, well-scoped tasks. Users report success in automating tedious background work, generating boilerplate code (e.g., data classes, database configurations), and handling small, isolated bug fixes. This allows developers to focus on higher-level design and problem-solving. The key to effective use appears to be treating AI as an assistant or "abstraction layer" rather than a replacement, maintaining strict oversight, and sanity-checking all generated code.

A notable sub-theme is the potential for AI to introduce unnecessary complexity, such as over-engineering simple fixes or adding unsolicited features, which can make code reviews harder. There is also concern that management pressure to increase velocity could lead to a culture of shipping low-quality code, shifting developer effort from creation to incident response. Ultimately, the community suggests a pragmatic approach: leverage AI for productivity where it excels, but remain vigilant about code ownership, quality, and the fundamental need for human expertise.

## [Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison](https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/)
**Score:** 110 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46745922

> **Article:** The article "Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison" benchmarks the processing speed of all five generations of Raspberry Pi. Using a 1080p H.264 video playback test, it demonstrates a massive performance leap with each generation, culminating in the Pi 5 being approximately 600 times faster than the original Pi 1. The piece highlights the evolution from the single-core Pi 1 to the quad-core Pi 5, illustrating the exponential growth in computing power available in the popular single-board computer series.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical realities of Raspberry Pi ownership, often contrasting the impressive raw performance gains with the increasing complexity and power consumption of newer models.

A major theme was the debate over whether newer models are actually better for common hobbyist projects. Several users argued that the Pi 3 represents a "sweet spot" due to its low power draw, stable performance, and lower cost, noting that the Pi 4 and 5 require more power, specialized cooling, and complex power supplies. One commenter suggested that a "Pi 3 with fewer headaches" would be more popular than a Pi 5 with bigger numbers, a sentiment that resonated with others who feel the platform has become more inconvenient over time.

The choice of benchmark—1080p video playback—was also heavily scrutinized. Commenters pointed out that the original Pi 1 was specifically designed with hardware for this task, making it an unfair comparison. They noted that modern software often neglects these fixed-function hardware blocks, forcing the Pi 5 to use its powerful generic CPU for decoding, which is inefficient but effective due to the sheer processing power.

Many users celebrated the longevity of older models, sharing stories of Pi 1s and Pi 2s still running essential services like DNS, print servers, or network exit nodes. This led to a broader discussion on the value of repurposing older hardware for low-intensity tasks rather than replacing it.

Finally, the conversation touched on the Pi's place in the wider computing landscape. Some argued that for non-GPIO-specific tasks, a used mini-PC offers far better performance and compatibility for a similar price, albeit with a significant increase in power consumption and physical size. The Pi 5's lack of a hardware H.264 decoder was also noted as a drawback for specific use cases.

## [SEC obtains final consent judgments against former FTX and Alameda executives](https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26450)
**Score:** 107 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46740644

> **Article:** The article is an SEC litigation release detailing the entry of final consent judgments against former FTX and Alameda Research executives Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the executives consented to permanent injunctions against violating securities fraud laws and agreed to multi-year conduct-based injunctions. Ellison also accepted a 10-year officer-and-director bar, while Wang and Singh received 8-year bars. The release notes that the judgments are subject to court approval.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focuses on the perceived leniency of the sentences compared to Sam Bankman-Fried's 25-year prison term. Many commenters expressed outrage, viewing the outcome as evidence of a "two-tier justice system" where wealthy or cooperative defendants avoid significant prison time for crimes involving billions of dollars. A key point of contention was the massive reduction in potential sentences due to cooperation; while some argued this is standard legal procedure and necessary to convict the ringleader, others felt the reduction was excessive for conscious participation in fraud.

Several tangents emerged regarding the executives' future prospects, ranging from cynical jokes about LinkedIn influencer careers to speculation about a potential presidential pardon for SBF. There was also specific scrutiny of Sam Trabucco, the former co-CEO who stepped down before the collapse, with commenters questioning his lack of legal consequences. Finally, users corrected the original post's title and URL, noting that the SEC release does not explicitly state the executives have been released from prison, but rather details the civil judgments against them.

## [Bye Bye Gmail](https://m24tom.com/bye-bye-gmail/show)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46746946

> **Article:** The article "Bye Bye Gmail" is a personal essay by a long-time Gmail user and marketer, Tom, who announces he is leaving the service. The primary trigger for his departure is the recent, unavoidable introduction of AI-powered summaries (from Google's Gemini) at the top of his emails. He argues that while he previously accepted Google's model of scanning emails for targeted advertising, using his personal and commercial correspondence to train LLMs is a step too far. He sees this as an unacceptable risk to his privacy and intellectual property. The author details his frustration with the inability to disable these new AI features without also turning off other essential "Smart Features" he has relied on for years, such as automatic email sorting into tabs (Primary, Promotions, etc.). He concludes by stating he is moving his email to Microsoft Outlook as an intermediate step, with ProtonMail as a future option if Microsoft also implements similar AI data usage policies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's frustrations, with many users expressing a shared sense of unease about the forced integration of AI into core services. A central theme is the difficulty in disabling these new features. Several commenters confirm that turning off "Smart Features" to escape AI summaries is a drastic measure that also disables useful, long-standing functionalities, creating a frustrating "all or nothing" choice.

Alternatives to Gmail are a major focus of the conversation. While some users suggest services like Fastmail, Zoho, or Infomaniak, the author's choice to move to Microsoft Outlook is widely criticized as a poor one, with commenters warning that it's simply "out of the frying pan, into the fire." The discussion also explores more private options like ProtonMail, but users point out practical drawbacks, such as difficulties with search and non-standard IMAP access due to its encryption model. The idea of self-hosting an email server is brought up, but most agree it is neither easy nor advisable for the average person due to the high maintenance and deliverability challenges. Finally, the conversation touches on the practicalities of migrating from a long-held Gmail account, with users sharing strategies for forwarding and transferring old data.
