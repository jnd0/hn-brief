# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-25

## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 692 | **Comments:** 438 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** BirdyChat, a chat application from Latvia, has announced it is the first European app to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp. This is made possible by the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the EU, which mandates that large "gatekeeper" platforms like WhatsApp open their services to competitors. The feature allows BirdyChat users in the European Economic Area (EEA) to start chats with WhatsApp users in the same region simply by using their phone number.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the announcement, focusing on the practical limitations and Meta's potential for "malicious compliance" with the DMA.

A central point of contention is that WhatsApp has implemented the interoperability feature as an opt-in for its users. Commenters argue this significantly hinders adoption, as it requires WhatsApp users to manually enable a setting to receive messages from other apps, making it "dead in the water" for the average person. There is also confusion about how this affects end-to-end encryption, though one commenter links to a Meta engineering blog post for technical details.

Many users express a deeper frustration with the state of messaging protocols, contrasting the current situation with the "open protocol" era of IRC and XMPP. They lament that users have consistently chosen the superior user experience of closed, proprietary apps over the freedom of open standards. This leads to a broader debate about iMessage, with some hoping it will be forced to open up, while others note it received an exemption from the DMA in the EU.

The most critical comments focus on the companies involved. BirdyChat and another interoperable app, Haiket, are described as "completely unknown" with no significant user base. This fuels suspicion that Meta is engaging in malicious compliance by partnering with obscure, potentially B2B-focused startups. This allows Meta to claim it is following the law while creating a high barrier to entry for any serious competitor, who could then be accused of failing to meet the "easy" standard set by these small partners. The discussion concludes with a general sentiment of unimpressed skepticism toward a proprietary system being opened up in a limited, legally mandated fashion.

## [Adoption of EVs tied to real-world reductions in air pollution: study](https://keck.usc.edu/news/adoption-of-electric-vehicles-tied-to-real-world-reductions-in-air-pollution-study-finds/)
**Score:** 517 | **Comments:** 499 | **ID:** 46749198

> **Article:** A study from USC Keck analyzed air quality data in California neighborhoods from 2019 to 2023, correlating the registration of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) with levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) measured by satellite. The researchers found a measurable improvement in air quality: for every 200 new ZEVs registered in a neighborhood, NO₂ levels dropped by approximately 1.1%. This suggests that the adoption of electric vehicles is directly tied to real-world reductions in local air pollution.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validated the study's findings but branched out into related topics about the practical and environmental realities of EV adoption.

Most commenters accepted the study's premise, noting that even if EVs simply shift pollution from dense urban areas to power plants, it is a net positive for public health. Some users provided anecdotal evidence, describing the noxious fumes from aging internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and the immediate benefit of reduced exhaust in personal spaces like garages. Personal experiences from expats living in Beijing highlighted a dramatic improvement in air quality over the last decade, which they attributed largely to the mass adoption of EVs and the relocation of heavy industry.

However, the conversation also introduced several counterpoints and complexities regarding the environmental impact of EVs:
*   **Infrastructure and Vehicle Types:** Several users argued that Tesla has not yet solved the heavy-duty truck market, noting that the Ford F-150 Lightning has seen more commercial success than the Cybertruck. They emphasized that battery capacity and charging infrastructure (megawatt chargers) remain hurdles for widespread adoption in commercial trucking.
*   **Non-Exhaust Emissions:** While the study focused on NO₂ (tailpipe emissions), commenters noted that tire and brake dust remain sources of particulate matter. However, others pointed out that regenerative braking in EVs significantly reduces brake dust compared to ICE vehicles.
*   **Weight and Road Damage:** A recurring concern was the increased weight of EVs causing faster road degradation (referencing the "fourth power law"). This was countered by the observation that many EVs, such as the Tesla Model 3, weigh comparable amounts to their ICE counterparts (e.g., a BMW 3 Series).
*   **Supply Chain Ethics:** One user raised the issue of "environmental externalization," arguing that lithium mining exports pollution to developing nations like Africa. This was countered by the assertion that the pollution from mining is negligible compared to the lifetime emissions of burning fossil fuels.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader urban planning themes, with some users contrasting the walkability and quietness of East Asian cities (like Shanghai) with Western cities (like Sydney or San Francisco), suggesting that cultural resistance to change in wealthy, aging Western populations hinders the kind of rapid infrastructure modernization seen in the East.

## [A flawed paper in Management Science has been cited more than 6,000 times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 472 | **Comments:** 247 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The linked article, from the statistical modeling blog "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science," critiques a highly influential paper in the field of management science. The author, Andrew Gelman, argues that despite being cited over 6,000 times, the paper contains significant flaws, including questionable statistical methods and unsupported conclusions. The core of the critique is that the paper's findings, which have been widely accepted and built upon, are not as robust as they appear. The post highlights a systemic issue in academic research where high citation counts can create an illusion of validity, even when foundational work is flawed. It serves as a case study for the broader "replication crisis" and the dangers of treating single, un-replicated studies as definitive evidence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expressing widespread cynicism about the reliability of academic research, particularly in social sciences and management. A central theme is the personal and professional difficulty of challenging flawed or fraudulent work. Several commenters shared anecdotes of failed replication attempts, with one noting their daughter abandoned academia for the private sector after her attempt to retract a flawed paper was blocked due to "political issues" between tenured academics. Another commenter described a family member who had to switch labs and research subjects after discovering faked data, a move considered career suicide. This points to a strong "don't rock the boat" culture that protects senior researchers and discourages scrutiny.

The discussion branched into several key points:
*   **Systemic Incentives:** Commenters argued that the academic system itself is broken. The pressure to publish novel, positive results (the "file drawer effect") makes it nearly impossible to publish replication studies or null findings. One user suggested a practical, if cynical, workaround: instead of trying to disprove a flawed paper, conduct "contrarian research" that produces a different, publishable result.
*   **Citation as a Flawed Metric:** There was a consensus that high citation counts are no longer a reliable indicator of quality. A user noted that many researchers "copy-paste citations" without reading the original sources, leading to the propagation of errors. This prompted a proposal for a "trust network" to overlay the citation graph, tagging papers that uncritically cite flawed work, though others were skeptical that such a system could avoid being gamed.
*   **Anecdotes of Misconduct:** Beyond honest errors, several comments described outright fraud. One shared a story of a biotech lab with faked results, while another mentioned the infamous (and non-existent) "Harvard Goal Study," which is frequently cited in corporate settings despite having no basis in reality.
*   **Nuance vs. Accountability:** A minor debate emerged on whether to blame individuals or systems. One commenter argued that labeling people as "bad" is unproductive and that focus should be on the systemic context. Another pushed back, asserting that repeatedly choosing the "easy path" of dishonesty or silence is a clear moral failing.

Overall, the discussion reflects a deep-seated frustration with the state of academic integrity, where political pressures, flawed incentives, and a culture of silence allow questionable research to flourish and accumulate influence.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 469 | **Comments:** 230 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The article on netzbremse.de alleges that Deutsche Telekom (DT) is intentionally throttling the internet by under-dimensioning its transit access points. The core claim is that to achieve decent connection speeds for DT customers, internet services are forced into paid contracts with DT, effectively creating a "fast lane" for those who pay while degrading performance for others. This practice is presented as a violation of net neutrality principles, where DT leverages its market position to monetize connectivity rather than providing equitable access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of technical analysis, personal grievances, and broader cultural critiques regarding Deutsche Telekom (DT). The conversation can be grouped into several key themes:

**Technical and Business Practices:**
Multiple users confirm DT's poor reputation, citing specific issues like under-provisioned transit points and a refusal to maintain cost-neutral peering agreements, particularly with networks like Cloudflare. This results in high latency or complete unreachability for many sites outside Germany during peak hours. Users note that DT's strategy appears to be forcing other networks to become paying customers rather than engaging in standard peering, which degrades service quality for end-users. The discussion also touches on the technical limitations of DT's infrastructure, such as aging DSL lines and the lack of real Ethernet connections.

**Personal Experiences and Alternatives:**
Several commenters share firsthand accounts of DT's unreliable service, including slow website loading, rain-induced outages, and specific problems accessing sites behind Cloudflare. Frustration is high, especially for those in areas where DT holds a de facto monopoly. Alternatives are discussed, with users mentioning Vodafone as a slightly better option, though not perfect. Starlink is highlighted as a viable solution for some, offering higher speeds and reliability, though it is not without its own limitations (e.g., line-of-sight issues).

**Broader Societal and Regulatory Critiques:**
The discussion expands beyond DT to critique systemic issues in Germany. Commenters point out contradictions in German society, such as having the largest economy in the EU but being plagued by bureaucracy and lobbying. The railway system is mentioned as another example of infrastructure failing due to special interests. There is also criticism of Germany's approach to privacy and security, where paranoia about surveillance coexists with the use of insecure, unpatched devices. The "radio tax" (GEZ) is cited as another example of a well-intentioned but flawed system.

**Tone and Meta-Commentary:**
The tone ranges from technical and analytical to frustrated and cynical. Some users criticize the article's format (a video explainer), while others defend it as pragmatic. There is a recurring sentiment that DT's monopoly power allows it to ignore customer complaints, and that regulatory intervention is needed. The discussion also includes a meta-comment about the difficulty of serving the German market, with some developers noting low conversion rates despite localization efforts.

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes a technical implementation for adding a comment section to a static blog using Bluesky (a decentralized social network). The author explains how they utilize Bluesky's API to fetch comments associated with a specific post tag and embed them directly into the blog's static HTML. This approach allows for dynamic, interactive comments on a site that otherwise requires no backend server or database, leveraging an existing social platform to handle the user interface and data storage.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to the technical implementation, with several users sharing similar projects or suggesting improvements. The primary theme was the utility of using social platforms as a backend for static site comments. Users discussed alternative methods, such as using Cloudflare Workers to handle comments or automating the process via GitHub pull requests for moderation.

However, the discussion also sparked a broader debate regarding the sustainability and philosophy of relying on centralized, for-profit platforms for core website functionality. Several commenters expressed skepticism about Bluesky's long-term viability, arguing that it might eventually suffer the same fate as Twitter (X) and that open, self-hosted, or fediverse-based solutions (like Mastodon) are philosophically superior. One comment dismissing Bluesky was flagged by a moderator for being a shallow dismissal. Additionally, a user detailed their specific requirements for blog comments (e.g., code blocks, screenshots, spam protection), explaining why they stick with Disqus despite its flaws, highlighting the trade-offs between convenience and control in comment systems.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 275 | **Comments:** 233 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article discusses Europe's strategic push to reduce its dependence on US internet technology and infrastructure. It highlights concerns over "digital sovereignty," citing the dominance of American tech giants in areas like cloud computing, social media, and payment systems. The piece points to specific European initiatives, such as a pilot project in Helsingborg, Sweden, designed to test the resilience of public services in the event of a digital blackout. The underlying motivation is a mix of economic ambition to foster local growth and geopolitical anxiety regarding the reliability and political influence of US-based platforms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, viewing the reduction of reliance on US technology as a necessary and "sane" move for Europe. The conversation is driven by a shared distrust of US tech oligarchs, with commenters arguing that these companies prioritize profit and political influence over user interests. There is a consensus that the US is no longer a stable or neutral provider of essential digital infrastructure, regardless of future political changes.

However, the discussion highlights significant challenges and internal conflicts. A major theme is the perceived lack of European alternatives that can match the convenience and integration of US products, leading to a defeatist attitude among some businesses and individuals. Commenters debate the root causes of Europe's lag in tech innovation, with some blaming Europe's social policies and shorter work weeks, while others argue that the problem is one of political will and strategic focus rather than economic structure.

The conversation also touches on the broader geopolitical context, including the role of US tech giants in influencing European politics and the potential for a "digital blackout" as a national security threat. While some see open-source software as a potential path to sovereignty, the prevailing sentiment is that overcoming the inertia of established US tech ecosystems will require significant, coordinated effort and a willingness to endure short-term pain for long-term gain.

## [Poland's energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/)
**Score:** 274 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46747827

> **Article:** A new, never-before-seen wiper malware targeted Poland's energy grid in an attempt to disrupt communication between power generation installations and grid operators. The attack failed and did not cause any power outages. The article notes that a similar 2015 attack in Ukraine successfully left 230,000 people without electricity for six hours, highlighting the potential danger of such cyberwarfare tactics.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on attributing the attack to Russia, with users citing Poland's role as a key logistical hub for Western aid to Ukraine as a clear motive. The failure of the attack was noted as a positive outcome, though commenters expressed concern that such "weapon-grade" malware reveals advanced Russian capabilities that defenders must now learn to counter.

Several technical points were raised about how the attack might have occurred, especially given that critical infrastructure is often assumed to be air-gapped. Users suggested possibilities like compromised third-party suppliers or social engineering, drawing parallels to the Stuxnet attack. There was also a broader debate on Europe's response to Russian aggression, with some commenters criticizing the EU for a perceived lack of unity and for continuing to purchase Russian energy, while others questioned why symmetrical cyberattacks on Russia's own infrastructure are not more widely reported. A separate, minor thread humorously misinterpreted "wiper malware" as a connected car feature.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article, authored by MP Zarah Sultana, argues that Palantir should be excluded from UK public services, particularly the Ministry of Defence. It contends that the company's deep ties to US intelligence and military apparatus, its history of working with authoritarian regimes, and its controversial predictive policing technologies pose a threat to UK sovereignty, privacy, and democratic accountability. The piece frames the reliance on Palantir as a step towards a surveillance state and calls for a rejection of such US big-tech dominance in critical public infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with debate centering on three main themes: the specific issue of Palantir, the broader context of US big-tech in government, and the credibility of the article's author.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the broader surveillance state, with users arguing that the UK has been incrementally building a surveillance infrastructure for years, making the specific vendor (Palantir) less relevant than the underlying political will. Several commenters expressed a sense of futility, suggesting it may be "too late to get off the train" of mass surveillance. This led to a debate on political solutions, with some advocating for electing representatives who prioritize public interest over corporate ties, while others were cynical, noting that protesting has become increasingly difficult.

The discussion also expanded to a critique of all major US technology companies, not just Palantir. It was argued that firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are equally or more dangerous due to their scale and existing government contracts. The idea of technological sovereignty was raised, with a call for EU and other nations to develop independent capabilities. However, this was tempered by a pragmatic viewpoint noting that replacing these firms is complex, as large consulting firms would likely step in to manage any transition without fundamentally changing the outcome.

Finally, the conversation was sharply divided by the personal credibility of the article's author, Zarah Sultana. One commenter strongly condemned her as a "racist conspiracy theorist," linking to sources to support this claim and thereby dismissing the article's premise. This accusation was met with skepticism from others, who advised taking such claims "with a grain of salt" due to the polarized nature of the discourse and suggested the source of the criticism was biased propaganda. This exchange highlights how the debate became entangled with wider political controversies beyond the core issue of Palantir.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior local health officials in Iran have claimed the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures, citing a German-Iranian eye doctor as a primary source. The report contrasts this number with lower estimates from other groups, such as the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which had confirmed 5,459 deaths and was investigating over 17,000 more at the time of writing.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is polarized, centering on skepticism regarding the reported death toll and the geopolitical context. A significant portion of the comments express doubt about the 30,000 figure, drawing parallels to past instances of intelligence failures or alleged propaganda used to justify military intervention, such as the WMDs in Iraq. Users point to the lack of on-the-ground independent verification and the reliance on a single source as reasons to treat the numbers with caution.

Conversely, other users argue that the absence of independent reporting is a direct result of the Iranian government's severe crackdown, including internet shutdowns and jamming of communications, which makes verification difficult. They contend that the high numbers are plausible given the regime's brutality and the scale of the protests. The discussion also branches into technical and historical topics. One user provides a detailed analysis of how modern internet shutdowns are becoming more sophisticated, calling for developers to prioritize "offline-first" and decentralized technologies to empower citizens in crisis zones, though this is debated by others who see it as an impractical requirement for most applications. Other tangents include debates over the validity of comparing the death toll to historical events like the Dresden bombing and the role of external actors in the crackdown.

## [Postmortem: Our first VLEO satellite mission (with imagery and flight data)](https://albedo.com/post/clarity-1-what-worked-and-where-we-go-next)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46747119

> **Article:** Albedo published a detailed postmortem of their first Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) satellite mission, Clarity-1. The mission successfully demonstrated their custom satellite bus and high-resolution optical payload (aiming for <10cm resolution from 250km altitude). The postmortem highlights several key achievements, including successful deployment, thermal management, and power systems. However, the mission faced significant challenges: a failure in the Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) due to lubricant issues at operating temperatures, and a critical failure of the TT&C radio preventing further command and data recovery. The team also navigated a low-altitude cover ejection to ensure space safety. The write-up concludes with lessons learned, emphasizing the need for deeper supply chain vetting and in-house radio development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused heavily on the technical specifics of the mission and the company's communication style.

**Technical Engineering & Failure Analysis**
Users engaged deeply with the root causes of the mission's anomalies. The failure of the CMGs due to lubricant issues sparked a debate on testing methodologies; commenters questioned why thermal chamber stress tests didn't catch the issue, speculating it might have been a duration or margin problem. Regarding the corrupted radio memory, the Albedo team explained that they had concerns about the supplier's NAND and ECC implementation and plan to build proprietary radios in the future to gain better control over diagnostics and redundancy. There was also technical scrutiny regarding the optical physics, with users asking how the 1m optic achieved 10cm resolution (beyond the diffraction limit), though this went unanswered in the thread.

**Business Strategy & Communication Style**
A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the postmortem's tone. One user offered unsolicited advice, criticizing the "tech bro" language (e.g., "nailed it," "locked in") as unprofessional for a B2B space company seeking contracts from established aerospace firms. They argued that Albedo should adopt a more corporate tone to appeal to traditional decision-makers. Other users countered that the blog format is appropriate for recruitment and public engagement, and that the founder demonstrates a dual capability: accessible "tech bro" blogging and deep technical competence.

**VLEO Utility & Applications**
Commenters explored the strategic value of Very Low Earth Orbit. The Albedo CEO responded that lower altitude significantly improves performance for imaging, SAR, and active sensing (lidar/radar) due to the inverse-square and inverse-cube laws of range. He also noted VLEO's resilience benefits, such as natural debris clearing and survival below radiation belts following nuclear events.

**Miscellaneous**
Minor technical questions included geolocation accuracy (5-10m on this mission, aiming for 3-5m) and the definition of a "satellite bus" (a standardized platform, distinct from an electronics bus).

## [Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison](https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/)
**Score:** 209 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46745922

> **Article:** The article "Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison" benchmarks the processing speed of every major Raspberry Pi model, from the original Pi 1 to the current Pi 5. The primary benchmark used is the time taken to render a 1080p H.264 video, which demonstrates a significant performance increase with each generation. The results show a roughly 600x speed improvement from the Pi 1 to the Pi 5, visually illustrating the rapid evolution of the single-board computer's capabilities over the past decade.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the Raspberry Pi performance comparison reveals a community with diverse use cases and opinions on the product's evolution. While some users were interested in the raw performance metrics, the conversation quickly pivoted to more practical considerations.

A central theme is the trade-off between performance and convenience. Several commenters expressed frustration with the increasing complexity of newer Pi models, citing "weird connectors," demanding power requirements, and the need for new cases and cooling. One user argued that a modern Pi with fewer headaches (e.g., reliable power from a standard USB port) would be more appealing than a more powerful but more troublesome device.

There was significant debate over the article's chosen benchmark (1080p H.264 video playback). Commenters pointed out that the original Pi 1 was specifically designed with hardware for this task, making it an unfair comparison against modern software that relies on generic CPU power. This led to a broader critique of modern software bloat, with one user noting the irony that the Pi 5's brute-force power is needed to overcome "careless" software development.

Many users highlighted the continued viability of older Pi models for specific, low-demand tasks. The Pi 3 was frequently cited as a "sweet spot" for its balance of cost, performance, and power consumption. Others shared creative uses for even older hardware, such as a Pi 1 serving as a Tailscale exit node or a Pi 2 running a DNS server, emphasizing the satisfaction of giving old hardware a second life.

Finally, the discussion included practical advice on power consumption, with a detailed breakdown of the differences between Pi 3 models (B, B+, A+), and a comparison to used mini-PCs. While mini-PCs offer superior performance for a similar price, commenters noted they consume significantly more power, making the Pi a more efficient choice for 24/7 server applications.

## [Second Win11 emergency out of band update to address disastrous Patch Tuesday](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-second-emergency-out-of-band-update-kb5078127-released-address-outlook-bugs)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 156 | **ID:** 46750358

> **Article:** Microsoft released a second emergency out-of-band update (KB5078127) for Windows 11 to fix critical bugs introduced in the previous Patch Tuesday. The primary issue addressed was a problem with Microsoft Outlook, but the update was necessary due to the severity of the initial release's flaws.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely ignores the specific Outlook bug and instead uses the update as a catalyst to vent broader frustrations with the quality of modern Windows. Commenters express a general sentiment that Windows 11 is becoming increasingly slow, bloated, and unreliable, citing personal experiences with sluggish performance even on capable hardware. Several users attribute this decline to Microsoft's reliance on web technologies (specifically React) for core OS components like the Start Menu, which they argue leads to instability and poor performance.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the perceived negative impact of AI on software quality. Users mock Microsoft's development process as "vibe patching" and "slop," suggesting that AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are contributing to the low quality of updates. This frustration has led some users to explore alternatives, with one detailed comment describing a positive switch to Linux (Fedora) for its stability and respect for hardware resources, while others are simply waiting to move on from Windows 10.

## [A macOS app that blurs your screen when you slouch](https://github.com/tldev/posturr)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46754944

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Posturr," a macOS application designed to improve ergonomics. The app uses the computer's camera to monitor the user's posture and automatically blurs the screen when it detects slouching, acting as a real-time reminder to sit up straight.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of interest, skepticism, and humor. A primary concern for many users was privacy and security, with several commenters stating they would not grant camera access to an unaudited, non-notarized application. However, others countered that the app's small, open-source codebase makes it easy to review or have an AI audit, mitigating these fears.

Technical discussion centered on the app's implementation. The author clarified that it uses a simple vision library to detect head height, abandoning an earlier, less effective experiment involving the AI model Claude to assess slouchiness. Some users suggested using more advanced open-source models for pose estimation, while others debated the practicality of the app, noting that good posture often requires an external monitor rather than a laptop.

The conversation also branched into broader topics, including the relationship between posture and productivity, the high cost of ergonomic chairs, and humorous suggestions for similar applications, such as blurring the screen when the user isn't wearing their glasses.

## [Introduction to PostgreSQL Indexes](https://dlt.github.io/blog/posts/introduction-to-postgresql-indexes/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 11 | **ID:** 46751826

> **Article:** The article provides a comprehensive introduction to PostgreSQL indexes, explaining their fundamental purpose of speeding up data retrieval by creating efficient data structures. It covers the core concepts of B-tree indexes, the most common type, and details how they work under the hood. The guide also explores different index types available in PostgreSQL, such as GIN, GiST, and BRIN, and discusses best practices for their use, including multi-column indexes and the importance of choosing the right columns to index for optimal query performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the value of the article and the nuances of PostgreSQL indexing, with users sharing additional resources and debating specific technical points. The article was well-received, with commenters describing it as "essential reading" and a good in-depth introduction.

A key theme was the sharing of alternative learning resources. Several users highly recommended the website and book "Use the Index, Luke" as a go-to resource for understanding database indexes, particularly for B-trees. The official PostgreSQL documentation was also cited as being surprisingly well-written and enjoyable to read.

A more technical debate emerged around multi-column indexes. One user questioned whether the traditional wisdom—that an index is only useful if the query filters on its leftmost columns—still holds true in modern PostgreSQL versions. This prompted a detailed response from a contributor who clarified that while older versions could technically use such indexes, it was often inefficient (requiring a full index scan). They highlighted that PostgreSQL 18 introduces "index skip scan," a feature that makes multi-column indexes more flexible and performant for queries that don't use the leading columns. Another commenter noted that in such cases, a "bitmap index scan" might be used, but it's less performant than a proper index scan.

Finally, the conversation briefly touched on a related, more advanced topic: incremental view maintenance (IVM). One user expressed a desire for native IVM support in PostgreSQL, which would automatically update materialized views. This led to a discussion acknowledging the complexity of implementing IVM, especially concerning transactional consistency, and mentioning various external projects and a PostgreSQL extension (pg_ivm) that attempt to solve this problem.

## [Nvidia-smi hangs indefinitely after ~66 days](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/971)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46750425

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules repository where users report that `nvidia-smi` hangs indefinitely after approximately 66 days of system uptime. The issue appears to be related to B200 GPUs and NVLink, with the hang occurring predictably after 66 days and 12 hours. Users suspect a 32-bit counter overflow related to time tracking, and logs show NVLink "postRxDetLinkMask" errors immediately before the failure. The problem requires a full cluster restart to resolve.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around speculation about the root cause, with the leading theory being a 32-bit counter overflow related to time or uptime tracking, given the precise 66-day timeframe (roughly 2^26 seconds). Users noted the irony that a bug report number assigned internally matched the number of seconds in the failure window.

Several commenters shared personal anecdotes of similar long-running, time-based bugs. One detailed story described troubleshooting a Raspberry Pi kernel bug that caused USB failures after roughly a week, requiring complex workarounds like watchdogs and controlled resets. Another mentioned a National Instruments driver bug that failed every 31 days due to a Windows timer overflow. These stories highlighted the challenges of debugging issues with long feedback loops and the necessity of creative, layered solutions when fixes aren't immediately available.

Technical discussion touched on proper kernel programming practices, specifically the use of `time_before()` and `time_after()` macros to handle timestamp comparisons safely and avoid overflow issues.

## [We X-Rayed a Suspicious FTDI USB Cable](https://eclypsium.com/blog/xray-counterfeit-usb-cable/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46749053

> **Article:** The article from Eclypsium details the physical and electronic analysis of a suspicious USB-A to USB-C cable suspected to be a counterfeit of a genuine FTDI brand cable. By using X-ray imaging, the researchers compared the internal components of the suspicious cable against a known authentic one. The analysis revealed that the counterfeit cable used a cheaper, single-chip solution with fewer components, whereas the genuine cable utilized a more complex board with multiple chips and proper shielding. The primary conclusion is that the counterfeit cable would likely fail to perform at the required high-speed data rates and highlights the security risks posed by low-quality, potentially malicious hardware components.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the broader implications of hardware trust, supply chain security, and the specific reputation of FTDI. A significant portion of the conversation focused on hardware-based persistence and supply chain attacks. One user detailed a personal project to simulate such an attack by replacing a motherboard's PCH with an "unfused" chip from Aliexpress to bypass security features like Intel Boot Guard. Other users suggested alternative, less invasive methods for achieving firmware persistence, such as targeting network interface cards (NICs), server BMCs, or SSD firmware, or utilizing the Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) to execute code from the BIOS/UEFI.

The discussion also heavily scrutinized FTDI's brand reputation. Several users noted that FTDI has become "automatically suspicious" due to its history of using driver updates to intentionally brick counterfeit chips, a move many viewed as a brand-damaging "own-goal." This led to a consensus among many commenters that they prefer alternative, ubiquitous USB-serial chips (like CH340) that are more reliable and don't carry the same risk of corporate sabotage.

Finally, commenters debated the nature of the article itself. While some dismissed it as a marketing piece for the security firm Eclypsium, others accepted it as interesting and relevant content. The conversation also touched on the increasing complexity of everyday cables, with one user noting that modern Thunderbolt cables contain processors more powerful than early computers, underscoring the growing difficulty in verifying the trustworthiness of simple peripherals.

## [Two Weeks Until Tapeout](https://essenceia.github.io/projects/two_weeks_until_tapeout/)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46749671

> **Article:** The article "Two Weeks Until Tapeout" is a personal blog post detailing the author's experience designing a JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface for an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) as part of the Tiny Tapeout project. The author describes the intense, time-constrained process of preparing a chip for "tapeout"—the final stage before manufacturing. A key challenge highlighted is the lack of access to the official JTAG specification due to its IEEE paywall, forcing the author to rely on alternative resources for verification. The post is written in an engaging, narrative style, making a highly technical subject accessible and entertaining, and it emphasizes the accessibility of modern chip design through open-source initiatives and affordable shuttles like GlobalFoundries 180nm.

## [White House alters arrest photo of ICE protester, says "the memes will continue"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/white-house-posts-altered-arrest-photo-to-make-it-appear-ice-critic-was-sobbing/)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46755734

> **Article:** The White House posted an altered arrest photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a Minnesota civil rights attorney, to make it appear she was sobbing during a protest against ICE. The article from Ars Technica details how the official X (formerly Twitter) account manipulated the image, and notes that the administration has been unapologetic about the deception, stating "the memes will continue." This incident is presented as a rapid and blatant example of generative AI being weaponized for political propaganda.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the erosion of truth and the weaponization of AI in politics. A primary theme was the immediate danger of generative AI, with users noting that the technology is being adopted so quickly and unapologetically for propaganda that it is already dissolving social trust. Many expressed dismay at the state of US politics, describing the administration's actions as a deliberate strategy to create a "post-truth" environment where factual objectivity is undermined, making it easier to dismiss any information that contradicts their narrative.

Commenters also debated the consequences and potential responses. Some discussed the legal ramifications, suggesting the subject of the altered photo could have a strong libel case, though others were skeptical that the current Supreme Court would allow such a suit to succeed. There was a strong call to action from one user, urging non-violent protest, boycotts of supportive corporations, and political organizing to counter the regime. The discussion also touched on the unreliability of online discourse itself, with a user cautioning that judging public perception based on online comments is difficult in an era of AI and bots.

## [Doom has been ported to an earbud](https://doombuds.com)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46753484

> **Article:** A developer named "arin-s" has ported the classic game Doom to the PineBuds Pro, a pair of open-source wireless earbuds. The project is presented as a technical novelty, demonstrating that the earbuds' internal hardware is capable of running the game. To showcase the port, the developer has made it accessible online, allowing users to connect via a web browser to a shared queue and play the game running on the earbuds remotely. The project's website also provides links to the relevant GitHub repositories for those interested in the technical implementation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users celebrating the port as another fun entry in the long-running tradition of running Doom on unconventional devices. The novelty of an earbud being able to run the game is a common point of amusement and admiration.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the hardware itself. One user asks for opinions on the PineBuds Pro, and another user who owns them provides a brief review, noting they are a "great device" but have a limited battery life of about two hours with active noise cancellation enabled. The developer of the port admits they have never used the earbuds for their intended audio purpose, highlighting the project's focus on the hardware's computational capabilities rather than its audio function.

The port also sparks a broader philosophical and economic discussion about modern hardware. One commenter questions whether the ability to run a 33-year-old game on such a specialized device is a triumph of efficient software or a sign that hardware is becoming over-specified and economically inefficient for its primary purpose. Another user counters this, arguing that it's an economic success story where economies of scale have made powerful, general-purpose microcontrollers incredibly cheap, making them the most cost-effective option even for simple applications like earbuds.

Finally, the conversation naturally drifts to the limits of this "Doom on everything" phenomenon. Users joke about running Doom on other unusual devices, such as a disposable vape. This leads to a technical analysis of vape microcontrollers, with one user calculating that their limited RAM (e.g., 3KB) makes running Doom (which requires at least 4MB of RAM) impossible for the foreseeable future, humorously estimating it might be feasible in a decade if computing power continues to advance.
