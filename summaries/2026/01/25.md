# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-25

## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 678 | **Comments:** 423 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** The article announces that BirdyChat has become the first European chat application to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp. This development is made possible by the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, which mandates that dominant platforms like WhatsApp open up their services. As a result, BirdyChat users in the European Economic Area (EEA) can initiate chats with any WhatsApp user in the region simply by using the recipient's phone number.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and critical of the announcement, focusing on the practical limitations and broader context rather than celebrating the achievement.

A primary point of contention is the implementation of this interoperability. Several users point out that WhatsApp has made this feature an "opt-in" for its users, meaning a WhatsApp user must actively enable a setting to receive messages from other apps. Commenters argue this significantly hinders adoption and could render the feature "dead in the water," as it's a major hurdle for convincing friends and family to use it.

The conversation quickly broadens to a larger debate on open versus proprietary protocols. One commenter expresses strong disappointment, lamenting the "stupidity of proprietary chat protocols" and recalling the era of open standards like IRC and XMPP. They argue that users have consistently chosen the superior features and user experience of closed platforms like WhatsApp over the principles of open interoperability, a sentiment that is largely agreed upon in the replies.

There is also significant skepticism regarding the companies involved. Commenters point out that BirdyChat and another interoperable app, Haiket, are relatively unknown, closed-source, and have waitlists. This leads to a theory of "malicious compliance" from Meta (WhatsApp's parent company). The argument is that Meta is partnering with small, obscure, or even affiliated companies to meet the bare minimum requirements of the DMA, creating a difficult precedent for any larger, independent competitor that might try to join later.

Finally, the discussion touches on related topics. Some users question whether this could pressure Apple to open up iMessage, but others clarify that iMessage was granted an exemption under the DMA in the EU. There is also a brief exchange about the technical details of end-to-end encryption in this new interoperable model, with a link to Meta's engineering blog provided for clarification.

## [Man shot and killed by federal agents in south Minneapolis this morning](https://www.startribune.com/ice-raids-minnesota/601546426)
**Score:** 615 | **Comments:** 685 | **ID:** 46745047

> **Article:** The Star Tribune article reports that federal agents shot and killed a man in south Minneapolis during an operation. The incident is described as an officer-involved shooting, with federal agents from ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) involved. The article provides basic details of the event location and time but is light on specifics regarding the circumstances leading to the shooting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the federal agents' actions and expresses deep concern over the state of civil liberties and federal authority in the United States. The conversation is dominated by the sharing and analysis of video evidence linked from Reddit, which users claim shows the victim being pinned to the ground by multiple agents before being shot.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Condemnation of the Shooting:** Commenters widely describe the event as a "summary execution" and "brownshirt" tactics, referencing the video which allegedly depicts the victim being restrained and beaten before being shot multiple times. There is significant skepticism toward the official ICE statement that the victim was armed and posed a lethal threat, with users arguing the video contradicts this narrative.
*   **Political Context and Motivation:** Users link the incident to the current political climate, specifically the Trump administration's rhetoric and policies. Several comments suggest the violence is intentional—a method to incite division and justify further crackdowns. The specific targeting of Minneapolis is attributed to its large Somali population and local political opposition to the administration.
*   **Federal vs. State Power:** A sub-thread discusses the legal and practical ability of Minnesota or Minneapolis to resist or expel federal agents. While users acknowledge the theoretical balance of power, they conclude that current federal conduct—described as lawless—complicates traditional legal remedies. Suggestions ranged from state-level criminal charges against agents to economic boycotts of federal operations within the state.
*   **Institutional Failure and Censorship:** There is a pervasive sentiment that the justice system, particularly the Department of Justice, will fail to hold the agents accountable, citing the recent case of Renee Good as a precedent. Users also debated the article's visibility on Hacker News itself, with some accusing the platform's moderation ("censors") of suppressing the story, while others attributed its removal to user flagging.
*   **Second Amendment Irony:** Several commenters noted the paradox of Second Amendment rights, arguing that while Americans are allowed to own guns, exercising that right in the presence of law enforcement often results in lethal force being used against them.

## [Adoption of EVs tied to real-world reductions in air pollution: study](https://keck.usc.edu/news/adoption-of-electric-vehicles-tied-to-real-world-reductions-in-air-pollution-study-finds/)
**Score:** 483 | **Comments:** 449 | **ID:** 46749198

> **Article:** A study from USC Keck analyzed air quality data in California neighborhoods from 2019 to 2023, correlating the registration of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) with satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). The researchers found a direct link: for every 200 new ZEVs registered in a neighborhood, NO₂ levels dropped by 1.1%. This indicates that the adoption of electric vehicles leads to measurable, real-world reductions in local air pollution.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding the study was largely supportive of the findings, with commenters sharing personal anecdotes about the negative impacts of diesel and gasoline exhaust, such as the smell and noise pollution in urban areas. Many pointed to the visible improvements in air quality in cities like Shanghai and Beijing following the mass adoption of EVs.

However, the conversation also introduced several counterpoints and broader considerations:
*   **Infrastructure and Vehicle Types:** Some argued that Tesla's Cybertruck is not the solution for mass adoption, citing the success of the Ford Lightning and noting that widespread EV truck adoption is currently limited by battery capacity and charging infrastructure (megawatt chargers).
*   **Environmental Trade-offs:** A key point of contention was the "externalization" of pollution. Critics argued that EVs simply move pollution from tailpipes to lithium mines in developing nations and that heavier EVs cause more road damage. Defenders countered that the pollution from mining is negligible compared to fossil fuel extraction and that centralized power generation is more efficient and easier to regulate than millions of individual tailpipes.
*   **Scope of the Study:** While the study focused specifically on NO₂ (a tailpipe emission), commenters broadened the topic to include particulate matter from tires and brakes. It was noted that EVs reduce brake dust due to regenerative braking, but tire wear remains an issue for all vehicles.
*   **Non-Exhaust Factors:** A tangential but notable theme was the desire for "dumb" EVs, reflecting a growing consumer fatigue with the software-driven, "smart" features of modern vehicles.

## [Deutsche Telekom is throttling the internet](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 433 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The article on netzbremse.de alleges that Deutsche Telekom (DT), Germany's largest ISP, is intentionally throttling the internet by under-dimensioning its network transit access points. The claim is that DT forces content providers and other networks to pay for direct, expensive contracts to reach DT customers at acceptable speeds, effectively creating a "fast lane" for paying partners and a slow lane for everyone else. This practice, if true, would violate the principles of net neutrality and degrade the user experience for DT customers accessing services that haven't paid for direct interconnection.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals widespread user frustration with Deutsche Telekom's service quality and business practices, with several key themes emerging.

Many commenters, particularly from Germany and Hungary, confirm experiencing significant performance issues, especially with sites using Cloudflare. Users report extreme latency, timeouts, and slow loading speeds, particularly during peak hours. This is attributed to DT's alleged refusal to establish cost-neutral peering agreements with networks like Cloudflare, forcing traffic through congested, under-provisioned routes. Several users shared personal anecdotes of switching ISPs or even moving residences to escape DT's monopoly, with some turning to alternatives like Starlink for better, more reliable service.

The conversation broadened into a critique of Germany's infrastructure and bureaucracy. Commenters expressed frustration with DT's de facto monopoly in many areas, which limits consumer choice and perpetuates poor service. One user highlighted a contradiction where DT's service issues were resolved only after they canceled their contract, suggesting a reactive rather than proactive approach to network management.

A secondary discussion thread focused on perceived contradictions in German society. Commenters noted the paradox of being a leading economy with a strong focus on privacy and worker protection, yet simultaneously plagued by outdated infrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles, and powerful lobbying interests that hinder progress (e.g., the railway system, net neutrality). This was contrasted with consumer behavior, such as a preference for unpatched Android devices despite a cultural emphasis on security.

Finally, there was a minor debate about the use of YouTube to host the video about net neutrality, with some calling it hypocritical while others defended it as a pragmatic choice for visibility. Overall, the discussion was highly critical of Deutsche Telekom, with users sharing technical and personal grievances that support the article's central claim.

## [A flawed paper in Management Science has been cited more than 6,000 times](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2026/01/22/aking/)
**Score:** 385 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46752151

> **Article:** The linked blog post from "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science" criticizes a 2012 paper in *Management Science* (by Kilduff, Mehra, and Dustin) that has garnered over 6,000 citations. The author, Andrew Gelman, argues that the paper contains a fundamental statistical flaw: it treats a correlation (between a personality trait and a job outcome) as evidence of a causal relationship, despite the study design being observational. The post highlights that the authors claimed their results were "robust" and "causal," which the author deems misleading given the data limitations. The post also notes that the paper's authors have issued a correction acknowledging a data error but maintained that it did not impact the main findings—a claim the blog author disputes. The overarching message is a critique of how weak statistical reasoning in high-impact journals can persist and accumulate citations without proper scrutiny.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the blog post's concerns, expanding them into a broader critique of academic incentives and the "replication crisis." A central theme is the difficulty of challenging established research. Several users shared personal anecdotes of failed replication attempts, noting that universities often resist retractions due to political ties between tenured faculty, and that junior researchers fear career suicide for "rocking the boat." While one commenter argued that the original poster's daughter might have been at fault, the prevailing sentiment was that replication failures are common and often suppressed.

The conversation also focused on the systemic issues driving these problems. Users lamented that high citation counts are now unreliable metrics, often inflated by "citation rings," author count inflation, and researchers who copy-paste references without reading the source material. There was a debate about whether "trust" networks or algorithms could flag problematic papers, but skeptics argued that any metric would eventually be gamed by academics desperate for tenure and funding.

Finally, commenters discussed the ethical and practical implications. Some argued that the academic system incentivizes "novel" (even if flawed) findings over rigorous replication, which is rarely publishable. Others shared stories of encountering outright data fabrication in biotech and the silence that surrounds it. The discussion concluded with a consensus that single studies should never be treated as definitive proof and that the culture of "getting along" in academia hinders scientific self-correction.

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes a technical implementation for adding a comment section to a static blog by leveraging Bluesky (a decentralized social network). The author explains how to use Bluesky's API to fetch comments associated with a specific blog post URL and display them directly on the site. This approach allows for dynamic user interaction on a static site without requiring a backend database or traditional comment hosting service.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the technical implementation, with several users sharing similar projects or suggesting improvements. A recurring theme was the desire for static-site-friendly commenting solutions that avoid third-party bloat; one user detailed a custom Cloudflare Worker script to handle comments, while another suggested automating the process via GitHub pull requests for moderation.

However, the discussion also sparked a broader debate regarding the reliance on centralized platforms for essential website features. Skeptics argued that depending on for-profit social networks (like Bluesky or GitHub) for comments is risky, citing the eventual enshittification of platforms like Twitter. While some users defended the approach as a pragmatic compromise, others expressed a preference for fully self-hosted or federated (Fediverse) solutions to ensure long-term sustainability and data ownership. A top-level comment dismissing Bluesky was quickly moderated by HN staff for being a shallow dismissal.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 228 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article discusses Europe's strategic push to reduce its dependency on US internet technology and infrastructure. It highlights concerns over "digital sovereignty," citing geopolitical risks (such as US political volatility) and economic disadvantages where profits flow to American giants. The piece points to specific initiatives, such as a pilot project in Helsingborg, Sweden, testing public services during a simulated digital blackout, and broader EU efforts to foster homegrown cloud providers and open-source alternatives. The goal is to create a resilient, independent European digital ecosystem rather than relying on US-based hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is polarized, with a strong consensus that Europe needs to pursue digital independence, but significant debate over the feasibility and necessary sacrifices.

Most commenters agree that reliance on US tech is dangerous due to political instability, corporate hegemony, and surveillance capitalism. Several argue that the US has become an unreliable partner, making European sovereignty a matter of national security. There is also a sentiment that this shift could stimulate economic growth within Europe.

However, skepticism centers on execution. Critics point to bureaucratic inefficiency, suggesting that EU regulations move too slowly to keep pace with tech giants. A recurring counter-argument is that European labor laws and social welfare structures (such as shorter work weeks and extensive leave) hinder the continent's ability to compete with the aggressive work culture of the US and China. Others express a defeatist attitude, noting the entrenched nature of US software (like Microsoft 365 and Active Directory) and the high switching costs involved.

The conversation also touches on the role of open-source software as a potential pathway to sovereignty, though some note that inertia and network effects keep users locked into American platforms. Geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine and US internal politics, are cited as accelerants for this necessary decoupling.

## [Poland's energy grid was targeted by never-before-seen wiper malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/wiper-malware-targeted-poland-energy-grid-but-failed-to-knock-out-electricity/)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 131 | **ID:** 46747827

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica reports on a cyberattack targeting Poland's energy grid using a novel wiper malware. The attack, attributed to Russian actors, aimed to disrupt communications between power generation and grid operators but ultimately failed to cause a blackout. The article contrasts this with the successful 2015 attack in Ukraine that left 230,000 people without power. It highlights the increasing sophistication of state-sponsored cyberwarfare targeting critical infrastructure in Europe, particularly in Poland, which serves as a key logistical hub for Western aid to Ukraine.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the geopolitical context, technical execution, and broader implications of the attack. Users widely agreed that the attack was part of Russia's hybrid war against Europe, with Poland targeted due to its role in supporting Ukraine. Commenters debated the vulnerability of critical infrastructure, noting that even air-gapped systems can be compromised via social engineering or supply chain attacks, citing Stuxnet as a precedent.

There was significant frustration directed at the European Union's perceived lack of unity and decisive action against Russian aggression. Some users argued that internal divisions, particularly between France and Germany, prevent a coherent response, leaving Eastern European nations vulnerable. Others criticized Europe's continued economic ties with Russia, such as purchasing energy through shadow markets, which undermines sanctions and defensive posturing.

Technical discussions focused on how such attacks are executed, with speculation that the targeted communication networks likely relied on internet connectivity (e.g., VPNs) rather than being fully air-gapped. The conversation also touched on asymmetries in cyber warfare, with users questioning why Ukraine doesn't conduct similar attacks on Russia's aging grid infrastructure, suggesting Russia's older systems might be less vulnerable or that its security practices are more draconian (e.g., using typewriters for sensitive communications).

Finally, some commenters noted the strategic cost of such attacks for the aggressor, as they burn valuable zero-day exploits and reveal tactics that defenders can learn from. The tone was largely critical of Western and EU inaction, with calls for greater solidarity and a more aggressive stance against cyber threats.

## [Palantir has no place in UK public services](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/zarah-sutlana-palantir-no-place-uk-public-services-ministry-of-defence/)
**Score:** 247 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46750852

> **Article:** The article, authored by MP Zarah Sultana, argues that Palantir Technologies should be excluded from UK public services, particularly the Ministry of Defence. It contends that Palantir's origins in US intelligence and its role in facilitating surveillance and military operations abroad make it incompatible with the values of a democratic public sector. The piece frames the company as a threat to civil liberties and national sovereignty, urging the UK government to prioritize ethical considerations and domestic alternatives over partnerships with such US tech giants.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, extending beyond the specific article to broader themes of surveillance, corporate power, and geopolitical alignment. A dominant thread is the consensus that mass surveillance is an entrenched reality in the UK, with commenters arguing that the issue is systemic and not dependent on a single vendor like Palantir. Many believe the UK public has become complacent, and that simply changing contractors will not reverse the trend toward a surveillance state.

The conversation also broadens to implicate other major US technology companies, with several users asserting that firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google pose an equal or greater risk due to their scale and existing government contracts. This leads to a debate on digital sovereignty, with a call for EU and other nations to develop independent technological capabilities to reduce reliance on US big tech.

A significant portion of the discussion is critical of the article's author, Zarah Sultana. One commenter attempts to discredit her by labeling her a "racist conspiracy theorist" and linking to a critical news source, while others express skepticism about such claims, highlighting the polarized nature of discourse around the figure.

Finally, there is a pragmatic counterpoint questioning the viability of simply rejecting companies like Palantir. This view suggests that governments actively seek the capabilities Palantir offers, and that without viable, cost-effective alternatives from domestic or European suppliers, such opposition is unrealistic. The discussion also touches upon the role of lobbying and the perceived alignment between big tech and government interests.

## [Iran Protest Death Toll Could Top 30k, According to Local Health Officials](https://time.com/7357635/more-than-30000-killed-in-iran-say-senior-officials/)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46754132

> **Article:** A TIME magazine article reports that senior Iranian health officials have claimed the death toll from recent protests could exceed 30,000. The article notes that TIME has been unable to independently verify these figures, and cites the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has confirmed 5,459 deaths and is investigating over 17,000 more.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is polarized, with users split between accepting the high death toll as plausible and expressing deep skepticism about the sourcing.

Many commenters argue the numbers are credible due to the Iranian government's severe restrictions on information. They point to the lack of independent observers, internet shutdowns, and jammed communications as evidence that the regime is hiding the true scale of the violence. The absence of a massive information campaign to disprove the claims is seen as an implicit admission of guilt. Some users also shared anecdotal evidence of seeing graphic videos on other sites, though the HN discussion itself is largely text-based.

Conversely, a significant portion of the discussion questions the report's sourcing and potential motives. Skeptics highlight that the primary source is a single German-Iranian eye doctor and that the 30,000 figure originates from the Iranian Ministry of Health itself, which they find contradictory. The historical context of flawed intelligence (e.g., WMDs in Iraq) is frequently invoked as a reason to be wary of such reports, especially in a geopolitical context that could justify military action. Some users also expressed disbelief at the scale of the number, comparing it to historical events like the bombing of Dresden, while others countered that targeting dense crowds is far more lethal than aerial bombardments.

A distinct thread within the discussion focused on the technological implications of the crackdown. One user argued that the internet shutdowns demonstrate a failure of modern tech to support dissidents, urging developers to build "offline-first" applications and decentralized mesh networks. This sparked a debate about whether such features should be a foundational requirement for all software or a niche consideration for specific use cases.

Finally, the conversation touched on the nature of evidence in the digital age, with one user questioning why so little video footage of the alleged massacres has emerged, while others countered that severe internet censorship and shutdowns make it nearly impossible to get footage out of the country.

## [Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison](https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46745922

> **Article:** The article "Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison" benchmarks the processing speed of all five generations of Raspberry Pi. It uses a mix of synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks, such as compiling software and video encoding/decoding, to quantify the performance gains with each new model. The results show a significant, roughly exponential increase in raw computational power from the original Pi to the Pi 5, highlighting the evolution from a basic hobbyist board to a capable mini-computer.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the Raspberry Pi performance comparison reveals a community with diverse and often critical perspectives on the platform's evolution. While some users appreciate the raw performance gains, many express a sense of nostalgia and a preference for the simplicity of older models.

A central theme is the divergence between the Pi's original purpose and its current trajectory. Several commenters argue that the performance benchmarks in the article are misguided, particularly the 1080p video playback test. They point out that the original Pi 1 was specifically designed with hardware blocks for this task, making it surprisingly capable, whereas modern software often neglects these optimizations, forcing reliance on brute-force CPU power seen in the Pi 5. This is framed as a regression in efficiency for the sake of convenience.

Another prominent theme is the increasing complexity and "headaches" of newer Pi models. Users lament the demanding power requirements, need for active cooling, and constant hardware changes, wishing for a modern board that prioritizes reliability and ease of use over raw speed. This sentiment is tied to the observation that for many long-standing applications like home servers, retro gaming (RetroPie), or 3D printing (OctoPrint), a Pi 3 remains more than sufficient.

The discussion also highlights practical use cases for older hardware. Several commenters share their success in repurposing ancient Pi 1s and 2s for low-bandwidth, 24/7 tasks like running DNS servers, CUPS printers, or Tailscale exit nodes, celebrating their reliability and low power draw. This leads to a broader debate on the Pi's value proposition versus used mini-PCs, which offer x86 compatibility and more power for a similar price but at a significantly higher energy cost.

Finally, there's a notable undercurrent of frustration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation's design philosophy. One commenter shared an anecdote about reporting a thermal throttling bug on the Pi 3, only to be met with a dismissive response from the forums, which resonated with others who felt the platform sometimes overlooks the needs of power users in favor of its educational goals.

## [Postmortem: Our first VLEO satellite mission (with imagery and flight data)](https://albedo.com/post/clarity-1-what-worked-and-where-we-go-next)
**Score:** 202 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46747119

> **Article:** Albedo, a space tech startup, published a detailed postmortem of their first Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) satellite mission, Clarity-1. The article outlines the mission's objectives, which included testing their custom satellite bus and a high-resolution optical payload. The team successfully launched into a 450km orbit and performed a controlled descent to 250km, demonstrating the viability of their VLEO approach. The write-up highlights several successes, including the performance of their custom Reaction Wheels and the overall thermal and structural design. However, it also candidly details significant challenges: a failure in their Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) due to a lubricant issue, intermittent memory errors in a third-party radio that eventually led to a loss of the satellite, and difficulties with their star tracker during commissioning. The post concludes with key learnings, emphasizing the need for deeper supply chain vetting, in-house development of critical components like radios, and more robust ground testing for VLEO-specific conditions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community response was largely positive, with users expressing admiration for the ambitious project and the team's transparency in sharing a detailed, data-rich postmortem. The discussion centered on several key technical and strategic points.

A primary theme was the root cause of the mission's failures. Users were particularly interested in the lubricant failure in the gyroscopes, questioning why standard thermal vacuum testing hadn't caught the issue. The CEO, Topher Haddad, acknowledged this as a lesson in the need for deeper supply chain investigation, a common challenge for resource-constrained startups. Similarly, the failure of the third-party radio prompted discussion, with the Albedo team explaining their plans to build their own radios in the future to gain better control over design, testing, and debugging.

Technical questions were also prominent. Users inquired about the physics behind achieving 10cm resolution from 250km, the purpose of VLEO (which the CEO explained as enabling superior imaging, sensing, and link budgets), and the accuracy of geolocation data. The Albedo team noted that while they couldn't fully calibrate this mission due to the CMG failure, they are targeting 3-5 meter accuracy for future systems.

A notable sub-thread focused on the company's communication style. One commenter offered unsolicited advice, suggesting the blog's "tech bro" tone ("nailed it," "locked in") could be unappealing to the conservative, corporate clients they likely need to secure large contracts. They recommended a more formal, professional tone to build trust. Another user countered that the style was appropriate for a company blog aimed at recruiting and building a public profile, and that the CEO's technical answers in the discussion demonstrated a more serious engineering focus. The CEO's engagement and detailed responses were widely appreciated.

## [Tao Te Ching – Translated by Ursula K. Le Guin](https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46745233

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub-hosted text of Ursula K. Le Guin's "rendition" of the Tao Te Ching. Le Guin notes that this is not a direct translation, as she does not know Chinese, but rather a poetic interpretation based on earlier translations and the Chinese text. The text presents the philosophical verses of the ancient Chinese classic in Le Guin's distinct literary style.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the nature of translation, the accessibility of the Tao Te Ching, and the specific merits of Le Guin's version. A key point is the distinction between "translation" and "rendition." Le Guin herself calls it a rendition, and commenters agree this is an honest framing. They explore the inherent difficulty of translating a poetic and philosophical text like the Tao, especially without knowing the source language. One commenter likens different translations to musical "cover songs," where each artist brings a unique interpretation to the same source material.

Several users share personal connections to the text. One describes its impact as a teenager, contrasting its philosophy of "low, quiet, and unseen" strength with American cultural values of dominance. This sparks a sub-thread on whether such philosophies are culturally ingrained or can be adopted, with a user noting that an immigrant steeped in this culture might struggle in America without adaptation.

The community's affinity for the Tao Te Ching is highlighted, with a moderator linking to several previous popular discussions on the topic. Le Guin's work is praised not only for this rendition but also for its influence on her own fiction, such as the *Earthsea* series. The discussion also touches on practical matters, such as the copyright status of Le Guin's work (which is not in the public domain), with some users encouraging the purchase of the official book to support the author's estate.

## [Second Win11 emergency out of band update to address disastrous Patch Tuesday](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-second-emergency-out-of-band-update-kb5078127-released-address-outlook-bugs)
**Score:** 198 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46750358

> **Article:** Microsoft released a second emergency "out-of-band" update (KB5078127) for Windows 11 to fix critical bugs introduced in the previous Patch Tuesday. The primary issue addressed was a bug affecting Microsoft Outlook, which caused significant performance problems and connectivity issues for users. This rare move highlights the severity of the initial update's flaws, which disrupted user workflows and required immediate remediation outside the standard update cycle.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly pivoted from the specific update to broader frustrations with the quality and direction of modern Windows. A central theme is the perceived decline in Windows 11's performance and stability. Users reported extreme sluggishness, with one commenter noting their system could "barely render web pages." This was attributed not just to updates but to fundamental architectural choices, specifically the use of web technologies like React for core components such as the Start Menu, which users described as "laggy" and prone to breaking.

A recurring point of criticism is Microsoft's reliance on "AI slop" and "vibe coding," with commenters blaming the use of AI tools like GitHub Copilot for the influx of bugs and low-quality patches. This sentiment is tied to a wider dissatisfaction with Microsoft's product philosophy, described as producing "bloat" that makes efficient use of hardware difficult.

The discussion also offered solutions and alternatives. Several users advocated for switching to Linux (specifically Fedora or Debian) for a more responsive and respectful operating system, with one user sharing a positive experience of gaming and hardware compatibility. Others suggested using third-party tools like PowerToys to bypass broken native features like Windows Search. For those staying on Windows, using the LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) version of Windows 10 was mentioned as a way to achieve stability and avoid disruptive updates.

## [Ask HN: Gmail spam filtering suddenly marking everything as spam?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46744807)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46744807

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asked if others are experiencing issues with Gmail's spam filter suddenly and aggressively marking legitimate emails (like USPS notifications, HR emails, and system alerts) as spam or suspicious. They noted that legitimate emails are being delayed and that standard rules, such as "never mark as spam," appear to be ignored.
>
> **Discussion:** The community largely confirmed the issue, describing a noticeable degradation in Gmail's filtering accuracy. Several users reported that legitimate emails are being incorrectly flagged as "suspicious" or delayed by up to 10 minutes, while obvious spam and scam emails are slipping into the Primary inbox. 

Technical explanations suggested that the problem might stem from Google's crowd-sourced filter weights or temporary issues with their scanning infrastructure, leading to disclaimers that messages "could not be scanned." While some users noted that their own spam filters remained effective, the consensus was that the algorithm has become overly aggressive with legitimate senders. 

The discussion also touched on general spam management strategies, with one user advising never to disclose one's primary email address to mitigate exposure. However, the prevailing sentiment was frustration over the declining reliability of Gmail's filtering and the potential impact on user trust and notification systems.

## [Nvidia-smi hangs indefinitely after ~66 days](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/971)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46750425

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the NVIDIA open-gpu-kernel-modules repository where users report that `nvidia-smi` and GPU jobs hang indefinitely after exactly 66 days and 14 hours of system uptime. The problem appears to be specific to B200 GPUs using NVLink, with logs showing "postRxDetLinkMask" errors immediately before the failure. A full cluster restart is required to resolve the issue. The timing strongly suggests an integer overflow in a 32-bit counter related to timekeeping.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on diagnosing the root cause of the 66-day hang, with the prevailing theory being a 32-bit counter overflow. Users calculated that 66 days, 14 hours, and 24 minutes corresponds to 5,760,000 seconds, a round number that fits a potential overflow scenario in a scaled time counter. The specific error "postRxDetLinkMask" points to a low-level NVLink hardware communication issue, likely triggered by a counter that tracks link state or timeouts.

The conversation broadened into shared experiences with similar long-duration, hard-to-reproduce bugs. A notable anecdote detailed a Raspberry Pi USB stack failure that occurred after roughly a week due to a kernel driver bug, requiring complex workarounds like controlled resets and watchdogs. Another user mentioned a National Instruments driver that failed every 31 days due to a Windows timer overflow. These stories highlighted the challenges of debugging issues with long feedback loops and the necessity of creative, multi-layered mitigation strategies when fixes aren't immediately available.

Technical discussion also touched on proper kernel programming practices, with a reminder that timestamp comparisons should use helper functions like `time_before()` to avoid overflow errors. A humorous observation noted that an internal NVIDIA bug number assigned to the issue coincidentally matched the number of seconds in the failure period, though this was likely a coincidence.

## [We X-Rayed a Suspicious FTDI USB Cable](https://eclypsium.com/blog/xray-counterfeit-usb-cable/)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46749053

> **Article:** Eclypsium published an analysis of a suspicious FTDI USB-to-serial cable suspected to be counterfeit. By X-raying the cable, they compared its internal hardware against a known genuine FTDI cable. The analysis revealed that the suspicious cable used a cheaper, single-chip design with fewer components, whereas the genuine cable utilized a more complex, multi-chip architecture. The article concludes that the suspicious cable is likely a counterfeit, potentially offering lower performance or reliability, and serves as a reminder of the risks in the hardware supply chain.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the broader implications of hardware trust, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the reputation of FTDI.

Users expressed concern over the prevalence of malicious hardware, citing the existence of offensive security tools like the O.MG Cable, which embeds attack capabilities within a standard USB cable. While some noted that the Eclypsium article functions as marketing, others accepted it as relevant and educational content.

Technical analysis in the comments allowed some readers to identify the counterfeit based on the presence of external buffers on the genuine FTDI chip versus the single-chip design of the clone. However, the conversation quickly pivoted to the risks of hardware implants that persist below the OS level. A sub-thread discussed methods for creating persistent malware via firmware, suggesting attacks on NICs, BMCs, or utilizing the Windows Platform Binary Table (WPBT) to execute code from the BIOS/UEFI.

A significant portion of the discussion criticized FTDI’s brand reputation. Several users referenced FTDI’s history of deploying driver updates that intentionally bricked counterfeit chips, which led many to view FTDI products as "suspicious" by default. Consequently, commenters expressed a preference for alternative, open-standard solutions like CH340 or generic USB-CDC devices, arguing that USB-to-serial is a solved problem and does not require reliance on a vendor with a history of aggressive anti-cloning tactics.
