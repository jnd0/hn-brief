## [BirdyChat becomes first European chat app that is interoperable with WhatsApp](https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp)
**Score:** 660 | **Comments:** 404 | **ID:** 46746476

> **Article:** The article announces that BirdyChat has become the first European chat application to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp. This development is enabled by the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Economic Area (EEA), allowing BirdyChat users to initiate chats with WhatsApp users using only their phone numbers. The implementation requires WhatsApp users to opt-in to receive messages from third-party apps.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a mix of skepticism, historical context, and regulatory analysis. A primary point of contention is the practical utility of the interoperability. While some commenters view it as a positive step that lowers the barrier to communication, others argue that the requirement for WhatsApp users to opt-in is a significant hurdle that renders the feature "dead in the water."

Several users expressed disappointment that this development is limited to proprietary protocols rather than open standards. Commenters lamented the decline of open protocols like IRC and XMPP, noting that while they offer freedom and interoperability, closed platforms like WhatsApp have historically won users over through superior features and user experience.

The conversation also touched upon the regulatory landscape, specifically the EU's DMA. Users debated whether this would pressure Apple to open up iMessage, with consensus leaning toward iMessage being exempt from the DMA's interoperability requirements due to its lower market share in Europe. There was also a technical discussion regarding end-to-end encryption, with users questioning how third-party clients would maintain WhatsApp's security standards.

Finally, a significant portion of the discussion focused on skepticism regarding BirdyChat itself. Commenters noted that the app is relatively unknown, closed-source, and currently has a waitlist. Some speculated that BirdyChat and a similar app, Haiket, might be "malicious compliance" products hand-picked by Meta to demonstrate interoperability without enabling genuine competition from larger rivals.

## [Deutsche Telekom is violating Net Neutrality](https://netzbremse.de/en/)
**Score:** 357 | **Comments:** 183 | **ID:** 46751899

> **Article:** The article, hosted on netzbremse.de, alleges that Deutsche Telekom is violating net neutrality principles. The core claim is that Telekom intentionally under-dimensions its transit access points. This practice allegedly forces external internet services to pay for direct contracts with Telekom to ensure their content is reachable at decent speeds for Telekom's customers, effectively creating a "fast lane" for those who pay and a slow lane for those who do not.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of technical and consumer-focused grievances against Deutsche Telekom (DT). A central theme is the widespread user experience of poor service, particularly slow loading times for websites, which many commenters directly attribute to DT's network management practices. Several users confirm issues specifically with sites using Cloudflare, suggesting a broader problem with peering agreements. One user noted that their personal website, hosted behind Cloudflare, was unreachable until they cancelled their DT contract, after which it mysteriously started working again.

Beyond the net neutrality issue, commenters highlight DT's de facto monopoly in many areas, leaving consumers with no viable alternatives. This frustration is compounded by DT's perceived poor infrastructure, with one user mentioning frequent service outages during rain. The lack of competition has led some to seek alternatives like Starlink, despite personal reservations about its owner.

The discussion also broadens into a cultural critique of Germany, with one commenter pointing out a perceived contradiction between being a major economy and being plagued by instability and bureaucracy. This was echoed by another who described a German paradox of being security and privacy-conscious while simultaneously using insecure, unpatched technology. The conversation also touched on the irony of discussing net neutrality violations via a YouTube video, though one user defended this as a pragmatic choice given bandwidth constraints.

## [I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog](https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46747366

> **Article:** The article describes a technical implementation for adding a comment section to a static blog by leveraging the Bluesky social network. The author explains how they used Bluesky's API to fetch comments associated with a specific post tag and embedded them directly into their blog. This approach allows for dynamic user interaction on a static site without requiring a backend server or traditional comment hosting services, while keeping the data decentralized and user-controlled.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the technical implementation, with several users sharing similar projects or suggesting improvements. A common theme was the desire for static-site-friendly commenting solutions that avoid third-party dependencies. One user detailed a custom Cloudflare Worker setup to send comments to a markdown file, while another suggested automating the process by using pull requests for moderation.

The discussion broadened to include the trade-offs of different commenting systems. A user with a tech tutorial blog listed specific requirements (code blocks, screenshots, spam management) and criticized existing solutions like Giscus for requiring servers or excessive GitHub permissions, ultimately sticking with Disqus despite its flaws.

However, the thread also touched on skepticism regarding the longevity of centralized platforms. Some commenters argued that for-profit networks like Bluesky are destined to repeat Twitter's history of enshittification, advocating instead for self-hosted or fediverse-based solutions. This sentiment was challenged by others who noted that defining a product solely by what it isn't ("we aren't Twitter") is a weak long-term strategy. A moderator intervened to shut down a shallow dismissal of Bluesky, reinforcing the guideline to provide substantive criticism.

## [Europe wants to end its dangerous reliance on US internet technology](https://theconversation.com/europe-wants-to-end-its-dangerous-reliance-on-us-internet-technology-274042)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 218 | **ID:** 46748771

> **Article:** The article discusses Europe's strategic push to reduce its dependence on US internet technology and infrastructure. It highlights concerns over "digital sovereignty," citing the dominance of American tech giants in areas like cloud computing, social media, and operating systems. The piece points to specific European initiatives, such as a pilot project in Helsingborg, Sweden, designed to test public service resilience in the event of a digital blackout, framing the move as a matter of economic growth and national security.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, viewing the reduction of reliance on US technology as a necessary and "sane" move for Europe. The conversation centers on the motivations behind this shift, which include escaping the influence of "US tech oligarchs," avoiding the perceived instability of American politics (specifically the influence of money in US elections), and countering "digital imperialism."

However, commenters are skeptical about Europe's ability to execute this vision. Several users point to a defeatist attitude within European tech circles, where US products are seen as too entrenched to replace. There is also a debate over the root causes of Europe's lag in tech innovation, with some blaming bureaucratic inefficiency and others arguing that European labor laws and social policies hinder competitiveness against the US and China.

Regarding feasibility, participants distinguish between replacing "commodity" software like Microsoft 365—which many argue is easily substitutable with existing alternatives—and the harder task of moving away from deeply integrated systems like Windows and Active Directory. The discussion also touches on the role of open-source software as a potential foundation for digital sovereignty, though inertia and network effects are cited as major barriers to adoption. Ultimately, while there is strong support for the goal, there is significant doubt about the political will and execution required to achieve it.

## [Tao Te Ching – Translated by Ursula K. Le Guin](https://github.com/nrrb/tao-te-ching/blob/master/Ursula%20K%20Le%20Guin.md)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46745233

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub-hosted text of Ursula K. Le Guin's "rendition" of the Tao Te Ching. Le Guin notes that this is not a direct translation, as she does not know Chinese, but rather a creative interpretation based on existing translations. The text presents the philosophical verses of the ancient Chinese classic in Le Guin's distinctive literary style.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the nature of translation, the accessibility of Taoist philosophy, and the specific merits of Le Guin's version. A key point of contention is the copyright status of the GitHub link, with some users arguing it's piracy while others defend it as a reasonable sharing of a 2000-year-old text.

Several distinct themes emerge:
*   **Translation vs. Rendition:** Users highlight Le Guin's own disclaimer that her work is a "rendition," not a translation. This sparks a broader debate on whether perfect translation is possible, especially for poetic and ancient texts. One user offers a compelling analogy, describing translations as "cover songs," where different artists can produce valid, distinct interpretations of the same source material.
*   **Philosophical Impact:** Many commenters share personal experiences with the Tao Te Ching, particularly how its ideas of "low, quiet, and unseen" strength contrast with Western values of dominance and self-assertion. This resonates with some in the tech community, who see parallels between Taoist humility and effective engineering or leadership styles.
*   **Cultural Context:** A counterpoint is raised that the Taoist values celebrated by Western readers might not translate well to success in a different cultural context, such as for an immigrant in America.
*   **HN's Relationship with the Text:** The discussion acknowledges HN's recurring interest in the Tao Te Ching, with a moderator linking to several popular past discussions on different translations.
*   **Le Guin's Legacy:** Many users express admiration for Ursula K. Le Guin, noting that the themes of the Tao Te Ching are evident throughout her fiction, such as the *Earthsea* series.
*   **Copyright Debate:** A minor but pointed argument erupts over the GitHub link's legality. Some users are concerned about pirating Le Guin's work, while others find the concern misplaced given the text's ancient origins and the author's death.

## [Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison](https://the-diy-life.com/raspberry-pi-drag-race-pi-1-to-pi-5-performance-comparison/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46745922

> **Article:** The article "Raspberry Pi Drag Race: Pi 1 to Pi 5 – Performance Comparison" benchmarks the processing speed of every major Raspberry Pi generation. Using a 1080p H.264 video playback test, it demonstrates a massive performance leap with each iteration, culminating in the Pi 5 being approximately 600 times faster than the original Pi 1. The piece serves as a visual representation of the hardware's evolution over the last decade.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered less on the specific benchmark results and more on the practical utility, architectural quirks, and philosophical direction of the Raspberry Pi platform.

A primary theme was the debate between using a Raspberry Pi versus a more powerful, x86-based mini-PC. Several commenters argued that for server or "daily driver" tasks, a used mini-PC offers vastly superior performance and compatibility for a similar price, albeit with higher power consumption. Others countered that the Pi's low idle power draw is essential for 24/7 operation, making it more economical in the long run.

Many commenters critiqued the article's choice of a 1080p video playback benchmark. They pointed out that the original Pi 1 was specifically designed with hardware blocks for this task, making it an unfair comparison against modern Pis that rely more on general-purpose CPU power. This led to a deeper discussion about the Pi's architecture, where the VideoCore GPU is the true "brain" and the ARM CPU is a subordinate processor.

The conversation also highlighted a growing frustration with the increasing complexity and power demands of newer Pi models. One commenter lamented that while performance has skyrocketed, so have the "headaches" like specialized power requirements and cooling needs. They suggested that a modern Pi with fewer complications would be more popular than one with bigger numbers. This sentiment was echoed by a user who still uses a Pi 3 as their main device, finding the Pi 5 a downgrade for their specific use case (video playback).

Finally, there was a shared appreciation for the longevity of older models. Users shared stories of repurposing obsolete Pi 1s for low-bandwidth tasks like running CUPS for printers or acting as a Tailscale exit node, celebrating the satisfaction of giving "e-waste" a new life.

The article outlines the mission's objectives, which included validating their custom satellite bus, demonstrating high-resolution optical imaging from VLEO, and testing new propulsion and attitude control systems. The post details a mix of successes and challenges: the satellite successfully reached its target orbit and captured imagery, but the mission was impacted by the failure of its Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) due to lubricant issues in the vacuum of space, and a critical onboard computer failed, likely due to a radiation-induced latch-up. The write-up concludes with key engineering learnings, emphasizing the need for deeper supply chain vetting, in-house development of critical components like radios, and more rigorous ground testing for space environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community engaged in a detailed and largely positive discussion, with the company's founder actively participating. Key themes included:

*   **Technical Deep Dives:** Users asked specific questions about the software stack, programming languages, and the physics behind achieving 10cm resolution from a 250km orbit. The founder explained that the resolution claim is based on a combination of optics and advanced processing, and that they plan to build more hardware in-house (like radios) to gain better control over testing and failure analysis.

*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Several commenters focused on the mission's failures. The lubricant issue in the CMGs sparked a debate about the adequacy of thermal vacuum testing, with users questioning if the tests were long enough or representative enough. The founder acknowledged the challenge of balancing startup speed with rigorous testing, noting the lesson to "dig multiple levels deep in supply chain."

*   **Business and Communication Strategy:** A notable sub-thread was a critique of the article's "tech bro" writing style. One commenter argued that this informal tone could be a liability when trying to secure contracts from established, conservative corporate or government clients. This sparked a counter-debate, with others defending the style as appropriate for a company blog aimed at recruiting and engaging a tech-savvy audience.

*   **Future Applications and Market:** Questions were raised about the practical applications of VLEO, such as geospatial accuracy for imagery and potential dual-use concerns. An Albedo representative clarified their business model is focused on providing VLEO systems and platforms rather than just an image service, while also highlighting the physics-based advantages of VLEO for sensing, communications, and space resilience.

**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46750358

> **Article:** Microsoft has released a second emergency "out-of-band" update (KB5078127) for Windows 11 to fix critical bugs introduced in the previous Patch Tuesday. The primary issue addressed is a significant malfunction in Microsoft Outlook, which was reportedly broken for many users following the standard update cycle. This rare move highlights the severity of the bugs that bypassed standard quality control testing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely ignores the specific Outlook fix to focus on broader frustrations with Windows 11's declining quality, performance, and design philosophy. The consensus is that the OS has become increasingly bloated and unstable.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Performance Degradation:** Users reported that Windows 11 feels significantly slower than previous versions, even on capable hardware. A common anecdote involved a user upgrading a laptop from a mechanical hard drive (HDD) to a solid-state drive (SSD) to resolve severe 100% disk I/O issues, suggesting the OS is no longer optimized for traditional storage.
*   **UI and Feature Failures:** Several commenters highlighted specific broken features, particularly the Start Menu search, which was described as a blank white screen or generally unreliable. This led to recommendations for third-party tools like PowerToys to replace native Windows functionality.
*   **Criticism of Modern Development Practices:** A recurring critique was Microsoft's reliance on web technologies (specifically React) for core OS components like the Start Menu. Commenters argued this "web-ification" contributes to sluggishness and a lack of native feel. The term "vibe coding" was used sarcastically to describe the perceived low quality of recent updates, implying a reliance on AI-assisted development without proper oversight.
*   **Migration to Alternatives:** The frustration has driven some users to explore other operating systems.
