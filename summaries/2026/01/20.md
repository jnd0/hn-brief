## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 726 | **Comments:** 729 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 US tariffs. It concludes that contrary to claims that foreign exporters would pay the tariffs, the costs are overwhelmingly borne by American importers and consumers. The analysis uses event studies of previous tariff shocks (such as on Brazil and India) to demonstrate that export prices from the affected countries generally do not decline; instead, trade volumes collapse. The article argues that the tariffs function effectively as a tax on the US economy, leading to higher prices for consumers and disrupting supply chains without significant benefit to domestic producers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's economic conclusions while exploring the political and psychological reasons behind the tariff policy. The consensus among commenters is that the economic burden falling on consumers is a basic principle of economics ("Economics 101"), and there is frustration that this is treated as a revelation or a point of political contention.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Economic Mechanics:** Users debate the pass-through of costs. While the general agreement is that consumers pay, some nuance is added regarding supply elasticity and the potential for Chinese producers to lower prices in other markets. However, data regarding China's Producer Price Index was cited to suggest that export prices to the US remained stable, reinforcing the article's claim.
*   **Political Motivation and Competence:** A significant portion of the comments question the intent and understanding behind the tariffs. Some speculate that the "intended result" might be the destruction of trade relationships rather than economic gain, while others view the policy as incompetent or chaotic. The unpredictability of the policy is cited as a major deterrent to business investment.
*   **Ideological Alignment:** Commenters noted the unusual economic alignment, observing that both Neoliberal and Keynesian economists tend to agree that the specific brand of mercantilism displayed in the tariffs is detrimental. There was also a debate regarding global trade imbalances, with one user arguing that persistent surpluses in nations like China justify the US taking unilateral action, though others disagreed on the effectiveness of tariffs as the solution.
*   **Legal and Institutional Concerns:** Users discussed the legal standing of the tariffs, referencing Supreme Court involvement and the potential for executive overreach. There is skepticism regarding the government's ability to enforce these tariffs long-term without legislative support.
*   **Source Skepticism:** One commenter expressed suspicion toward the German think tank producing the analysis, suggesting potential bias. Others countered that foreign institutions might offer a more objective view than domestic ones currently under political pressure.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 491 | **Comments:** 252 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** Amazon will end its inventory commingling program for third-party sellers on March 31, 2026. Under this system, when a customer bought an item "Fulfilled by Amazon" (FBA) from a specific seller, they might receive a seemingly identical item from a different seller's inventory stored in Amazon's warehouses. The change ensures that customers will now receive the exact item from the specific seller they purchased from, rather than a random unit from a pool of sellers claiming to have the same SKU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the announcement, viewing it as a necessary step to combat the rampant counterfeiting and quality control issues that plagued the commingling system. Many users shared personal anecdotes of receiving counterfeit or inferior goods—such as defective HDMI adapters and unusable toner cartridges—when buying from reputable sellers, noting that the lack of traceability often prevented them from purchasing certain categories of products on Amazon entirely.

While some commenters expressed cynicism, suggesting the policy shift is likely driven by significant financial penalties from manufacturers or large buyers rather than a pure commitment to quality, others expressed shock that the practice was legal in the first place. The discussion also touched on broader frustrations with Amazon's market power, with some users advocating for purchasing directly from manufacturers' websites. Additionally, the thread included an analogy to the Kenyan coffee industry, where a centralized commingling system historically prevented farmers from being individually rewarded for higher quality, drawing parallels to Amazon's "race to the bottom" logistics model.

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 467 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article links to a NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center announcement of a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm that occurred on January 19, 2026. This level of solar storm can cause voltage irregularities in power grids, potential grid system damage, and auroras visible at lower latitudes. The announcement serves as an official alert regarding the intensity and potential impacts of the solar radiation event.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News focused on the accessibility of the government alert, the visual spectacle of the auroras, and the practical implications of the storm.

A significant portion of the conversation criticized the NOAA website for its poor accessibility, specifically noting that the warning text was presented as an image without a text alternative, making it unusable for screen readers. Commenters identified this as a failure of government web standards, with one noting the image appeared to be a PowerPoint slide.

Many users shared observations of the resulting auroras, with reports coming in from Germany (Berlin, Munich), the Netherlands, and Austria. Several commenters linked to live webcams capturing the event, and there was a technical discussion about photography, confirming that while the auroras were visible to the naked eye, long-exposure photography captured them more vividly.

Regarding the severity of the event, users compared the G4 rating to historical events like the Carrington Event (which was a G5). While the alert was serious, commenters noted that the storm had not yet caused significant power grid failures in the US, citing warnings from grid operator PJM. The general sentiment was that for the average person, the event was more of a visual curiosity than a threat, though some discussed emergency preparedness for potential extreme solar events.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 463 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his civil rights protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter is a defense of nonviolent direct action against racial segregation. King argues that individuals have a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws, distinguishing between just and unjust laws based on their alignment with moral law and human dignity. He outlines the four basic steps of any nonviolent campaign: collection of facts, negotiation, self-purification, and direct action. King expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate," whom he identifies as a greater obstacle to freedom than outright segregationists due to their devotion to order over justice and their preference for a negative peace (absence of tension) over a positive peace (presence of justice). He also refutes the idea of waiting for a "more convenient season" for change and defends the urgency of the civil rights movement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the enduring relevance and multifaceted interpretations of King's letter. A primary theme is the nature of civil disobedience and the distinction between legal and just laws. Commenters highlight King's argument that breaking an unjust law openly and accepting the penalty is a form of respect for law, a concept some find less common in modern discourse. This leads to a debate on the application of these principles, with one user suggesting they could be misapplied to defend the actions of non-violent January 6th Capitol rioters, a notion quickly countered by others who emphasized the violence and forced entry involved.

A significant portion of the discussion critiques the modern interpretation of King's legacy. Several users argue that the historical focus on King's non-violence is a "white-washed" narrative that omits the concurrent and necessary threat of violence from groups like the Black Panthers, which created the political pressure for the "carrot" of King's approach. This historical context is seen as essential for a complete understanding of the era's social change.

The letter's critique of the "white moderate" is applied to contemporary politics, particularly within the Democratic Party in the United States. Commenters draw a direct parallel between King's "moderates" and modern liberals who are seen as prioritizing order and incrementalism over substantive justice, leading to internal party conflict with leftists. This is exemplified by discussions around policy responses to events like the murder of a woman by an ICE agent, where proposed reforms (body cameras) are criticized as insufficient compared to calls for abolition.

Finally, the discussion includes personal reflections on the letter's impact. Many users mention re-reading it annually, finding new insights with each reading, and credit it with shaping their understanding of justice and authority. The emotional weight of King's descriptions of explaining segregation to his children is highlighted as a particularly powerful and motivating passage.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 414 | **Comments:** 328 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the line between organic search results and advertisements. The change involves making paid app placements appear more integrated with standard search results, potentially increasing click-through rates and boosting Apple's revenue from its advertising business. This move signals a deeper push by the tech giant into mobile advertising, a sector dominated by competitors like Google.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant criticism and cynicism, framing the change as an inevitable consequence of corporate growth demands and a decline in user experience. The dominant sentiment is that this represents "enshittification"—a degradation of the platform's value for users in favor of monetization.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Erosion of Trust and Safety:** Several users argued that the App Store's safety claims are already compromised. They cited the prevalence of scam apps and impersonators in search results, noting that Apple's current system frequently fails to surface legitimate apps (like Microsoft Authenticator or ChatGPT) over paid copycats. There is concern that blurring ads with results will exacerbate this issue, leading users to install malicious or deceptive applications.
*   **Corporate Inevitability:** A recurring argument is that this shift is a natural result of capitalism and market saturation. Once a company like Apple exhausts growth from hardware sales and better products, it must turn to monetizing its user base through ads to keep revenue numbers rising.
*   **Comparison to Competitors:** Many commenters pointed out that this design merely brings the App Store in line with the Google Play Store, which has long utilized similar ad-heavy search result layouts. This comparison was often used to highlight a perceived decline in Apple's standards.
*   **Leadership Criticism:** The discussion included sharp critiques of Apple's current leadership, particularly Tim Cook. Users contrasted the current "spreadsheet-driven" management with the product-focused era of Steve Jobs, suggesting Apple is having its "Ballmer moment" (a reference to Microsoft's stagnation under Steve Ballmer before a revival under Satya Nadella).
*   **User Apathy and Lock-in:** Despite the negative feedback, there was a resigned acknowledgment that most users will not leave the ecosystem. Commenters described the "Walled Garden" as a trap where users are shamed or locked in by social and financial pressures, making alternatives like Android unappealing or equally problematic.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** The Cloudflare blog post details an incident where a seemingly minor change to their authoritative DNS servers caused widespread outages. The change involved reordering the Resource Records (RRs) in DNS responses, specifically placing A records before CNAME records, which is technically allowed by RFC 1034. However, this broke several widely deployed DNS clients and resolvers, including the `getaddrinfo` function in the GNU C Library (glibc) and Cisco switch firmware, causing issues ranging from resolution failures to device reboot loops. Cloudflare reverted the change and proposed an update to the DNS standards to explicitly require CNAME records to appear before other records in the answer section, formalizing the de facto behavior that many systems depend on.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the broader implications of the incident, particularly the challenges of maintaining compatibility with legacy systems and the ambiguity of internet standards. A central theme is the debate over whether the original RFC was truly ambiguous. Several commenters argued that the RFC's language ("preface by one or more CNAME RRs") was clear and that Cloudflare's interpretation was a misreading. They contend that the order is significant for following the resolution chain and that Cloudflare simply failed to test against common implementations.

The conversation also touched on software engineering principles. Many commenters expressed surprise that a major infrastructure provider like Cloudflare would deploy such a change without comprehensive testing, especially against a common library like glibc. This led to discussions about Hyrum's Law (all observable behaviors will be depended on) and the modern applicability of Postel's Law ("be liberal in what you accept"), with some arguing that strict adherence to standards is now more important than being liberal with non-standard inputs. The consensus among commenters was that Cloudflare made the right decision to revert the change and align with the de facto standard, as breaking countless existing devices is impractical, regardless of who is technically "correct" according to the standard.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 353 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-weight large language model released by Z.ai. It is a 31B parameter model (likely a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 3.9B active parameters) positioned as a high-performance, efficient model for tasks like coding and reasoning. The release includes weights available for download, aiming to provide capabilities comparable to larger proprietary models like GPT-4o mini or o3-mini, but in a size that is feasible for local hosting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to GLM-4.7-Flash is largely positive, with a strong focus on its practical utility for local deployment and cost-effectiveness compared to proprietary APIs.

Key discussion points include:
*   **Performance and Benchmarks:** Users are analyzing the model's reported benchmarks, particularly on SWE-Bench Verified, where it claims performance roughly on par with o3/GPT-5 mini. While some are skeptical of benchmark claims ("benchmaxxed"), the consensus is that it represents solid incremental progress for open models, which typically lag proprietary ones by about a year.
*   **Local Hosting and Accessibility:** A major theme is the model's suitability for running locally. At 31B parameters, it fits on consumer hardware (e.g., a MacBook with 32GB RAM or a 32GB GPU), making advanced AI accessible without cloud costs. Users are actively sharing setup instructions, with `llama.cpp` being the recommended tool for running quantized versions (e.g., Q4_K_M).
*   **Cost and Cloud Availability:** There is immediate interest in cloud providers offering the model. Early providers mentioned include z.ai and Novita, with OpenRouter listed as a source for finding providers. The model is noted to be significantly cheaper than alternatives like Haiku 4.5.
*   **Comparison to Other Models:** It is frequently compared to GPT-4o mini, o3-mini, and other small models like Qwen3-coder. While some users find small models insufficient for complex tasks, others highlight their value for specific use cases like writing tests or simple translations, especially when speed and cost are factors.
*   **Practical Experiences and Caveats:** Early adopters report that while the model is promising, tooling is still maturing. Some encountered errors running it locally, and one user shared a negative experience with the Cerebras inference platform, citing strict rate limits and high costs due to uncached tokens, which negated the speed advantage.

## [Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html)
**Score:** 337 | **Comments:** 415 | **ID:** 46686640

> **Article:** Porsche announced that in 2025, it sold more "electrified" vehicles (battery-electric and plug-in hybrids) than pure internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in Europe. However, the company's global deliveries fell by 3% year-over-year, with a significant 28% drop in the crucial Chinese market. The report highlights a shifting market dynamic where Porsche is successfully transitioning its European customer base to electrified powertrains, but facing broader headwinds from geopolitical tensions and increased competition, particularly from Chinese automakers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused less on the specific sales milestone and more on the broader implications for Porsche and the global automotive industry. The conversation revolved around three main themes:

**1. The Rise of Chinese Automakers**
Many commenters viewed the sales data through the lens of China's growing dominance in the EV sector. The sharp decline in Porsche's Chinese sales was interpreted as evidence that domestic brands like BYD are not only winning the EV race but are poised to become the new global leaders in car manufacturing, potentially displacing traditional German luxury brands. Commenters noted that Chinese manufacturers are targeting the entire car market, not just EVs, and are establishing a significant technological and production moat.

**2. Porsche's Product and Brand Identity Crisis**
There was significant skepticism regarding Porsche's current EV strategy. Several users argued that the brand is losing its prestige, describing the electric Macan and Cayenne as "ugly" and technologically inferior to Chinese competitors, lacking features like advanced driver-assist systems. The shift away from physical buttons and the loss of the "engine rumble" were cited as detracting from the driving experience. A recurring sentiment was that Porsche SUVs have lost their unique identity, becoming indistinguishable from other luxury SUVs, thereby eroding the brand's status as a Veblen good (a luxury item whose demand increases as the price rises).

**3. Market Context and Reliability**
While some commenters noted that the "electrified" figure includes plug-in hybrids—which helped boost the numbers—others pointed to conflicting reports of financial losses and a strategic pivot back toward ICE vehicles for future models. This led to a broader debate about the long-term reliability of German luxury cars versus Japanese and emerging Chinese brands. The consensus was that while German cars were once prized for their engineering, their reputation for reliability has waned, and the future of the industry is uncertain as Chinese manufacturers challenge established players.

## [The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button](https://paulmakeswebsites.com/writing/shadcn-radio-button/)
**Score:** 313 | **Comments:** 151 | **ID:** 46688971

> **Article:** The article "The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button" critiques the excessive code required to implement a simple radio button component using the popular shadcn/ui library. The author breaks down the component's source code, highlighting its reliance on multiple files, dependencies (specifically Radix UI primitives), and a high line count for what is a fundamental HTML element. The core argument is that this level of abstraction is unnecessary overkill, introducing significant complexity for a negligible gain in functionality or styling, and represents a broader trend of over-engineering in modern front-end development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters expressing frustration at the growing complexity and bloat in modern front-end frameworks. A central theme is the justification for such complexity. Some argue it's a necessary evil to achieve cross-browser consistency and accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation) that is difficult to replicate with vanilla CSS. However, others counter that for a simple element like a radio button, this complexity is unjustified, and modern CSS (like `appearance: none`) is sufficient for most styling needs without the heavy JavaScript and dependency overhead.

The conversation also touches on the nature of shadcn/ui itself. It's clarified that shadcn is not a traditional component library but rather a collection of wrappers around more fundamental libraries like Radix UI, meaning the complexity is often inherited rather than invented. A significant portion of the discussion critiques the broader front-end culture, with some commenters blaming "Shiny Object Syndrome" and the influence of "YouTube gurus" for leading junior developers to adopt overly complex tools without questioning their necessity. As an alternative, some users pointed to simpler, more lightweight libraries like Basecoat UI. Ultimately, the debate highlights a tension between the desire for pixel-perfect, accessible components and the principles of simplicity, performance, and maintainability.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint analysis of high-profile social media research reveals that nearly half of the studies published in top journals have disclosable industry ties (funding, collaboration, or employment). However, the majority of these connections are not disclosed in the published work. The study finds that industry-tied research receives significantly more attention from academics, policymakers, and the media, yet tends to focus less on the negative impacts of platform-scale features. The authors argue that this influence is extensive and opaque, necessitating stricter disclosure norms and policies to protect the integrity of independent research.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the study's findings, characterizing the lack of transparency as a systemic issue rather than a surprise. Commenters draw parallels to other sectors like pharmaceuticals, tobacco, and fossil fuels, noting that industry often funds research simply because academic funding is scarce. There is a consensus that this dynamic creates a conflict of interest, particularly when research influences policy.

The conversation diverges into two main themes: the erosion of trust and the ethics of corporate experimentation. Many users expressed cynicism and a desire to disconnect from the digital ecosystem, citing a broader crisis of trust in institutions. Others debated the regulatory double standards between academic and corporate research. Several commenters argued that social media companies conduct massive, unregulated experiments on users without the ethical oversight required in academia, a point that sparked debate over whether such oversight would be overly bureaucratic or necessary for public safety.

A notable meta-discussion emerged regarding the study's own potential biases, with users questioning the funding sources of the researchers critiquing industry influence. Additionally, the conversation touched on the "revolving door" dynamic, where expertise in social media often requires working in the industry, making it difficult to find researchers without ties.

**Score:** 274 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46686655

> **Article:** The article reports that Nova Launcher, a popular third-party launcher for Android, has been updated to include tracking and advertising SDKs from Facebook and Google. This change follows the launcher's acquisition by a new company. The update introduces permissions for Facebook Ads, Google AdMob, Branch analytics, and crash reporting tools like Bugsnag and Google CrashLytics, raising privacy concerns among its user base.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with disappointment and concern, with many users expressing a desire to switch launchers. A key theme was the search for alternatives, with users suggesting open-source options like Lawnchair and Smart Launcher. Several commenters discussed technical workarounds to maintain privacy, such as using older versions of Nova with network access blocked or running it on privacy-focused operating systems like GrapheneOS. There was also a debate about the necessity of switching, with some users arguing that older, feature-complete versions of Nova are still safe to use if they have no known vulnerabilities, while others countered that future updates could introduce security flaws. Other comments touched on performance issues, the lack of a perfect replacement for Nova's features, and the broader trend of privacy-invasive software updates.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that the European Union is actively rolling back digital rights due to intense lobbying from Big Tech and pressure from the US government. It details how the EU's "Digital Omnibus" proposal, intended to simplify regulations, instead weakens key protections under the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the AI Act. The author claims that US tech giants like Meta, Google, and Amazon have successfully influenced EU lawmakers to dilute transparency requirements, delay enforcement, and create loopholes that favor corporate interests over citizen privacy and safety. The piece frames this as a capitulation to American corporate power, facilitated by a European Commission prioritizing economic competitiveness over fundamental rights.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the perceived failure of EU leadership to protect digital rights and sovereignty, largely attributing this to corruption, US influence, and public apathy. A dominant theme is the critique of the EU Commission as being "pro-corporate and anti-citizen," with many commenters expressing cynicism about the effectiveness of democratic processes. Several users argue that politicians are insulated from public backlash, with one user noting that complaining on social media or even taking to the streets is unlikely to effect change.

There is significant discussion regarding the EU's reliance on US technology and the potential for geopolitical shifts to alter this dynamic. Some commenters view the current US administration's aggressive foreign policy (e.g., threats against Greenland) as a "silver lining" that might force Europe to recognize US untrustworthiness and build independent digital infrastructure. Others are skeptical, arguing that the EU is too entrenched in the "US imperial project" to pivot effectively.

The conversation also touches on the practicality of boycotting American tech products. While some users advocate for moving to European alternatives, others point out the difficulty of sustaining such movements, citing the dominance of US services and the lack of public concern regarding digital rights in Europe. Finally, a minority of commenters challenge the article's narrative, suggesting that EU regulations are overly burdensome and that the Draghi report highlights the need for deregulation to help European companies compete globally.

It is a full alternative to TCP/IP that operates over diverse physical links, including LoRa, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and serial connections. The project has reached version 1.0 and supports applications like MeshChat and Sideband for Android, enabling features such as photo sharing and voice chat. The core concept is to provide a decentralized, location-agnostic network layer where nodes are identified by cryptographic keys rather than IP addresses.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the technical capabilities of Reticulum, its comparison to similar projects like Meshtastic, and concerns about its long-term viability. Users are impressed by its versatility, noting it can run on any device with Python 3.8+ and support unconventional transport links like SSH tunnels or serial connections. A key point of interest is its ability to seamlessly route packets across different link types (e.g., LoRa to Internet to Ham Radio) without user intervention.

A significant portion of the conversation addresses the project's future. Commenters point out that the sole maintainer recently announced a step back from public interaction and community support, raising concerns about the project's sustainability and the difficulty of tracking changes due to vague commit history. There is also debate over the project's restrictive license, which explicitly forbids use in AI/ML training datasets, with some users questioning its enforceability given the code is hosted on GitHub. Finally, users distinguish Reticulum from Meshtastic, describing the former as a more robust, generic network stack, while the latter is a simpler, LoRa-only chat application.

## [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46682518

> **Article:** The article "Notes on Apple's Nano Texture" provides a hands-on review of Apple's anti-glare nano-texture display option, available on high-end Macs and iPads. The author, Jon, compares it directly to a standard glossy display, evaluating its performance in various lighting conditions. He concludes that while the nano-texture does slightly wash out blacks and colors compared to glossy, its ability to eliminate reflections makes it a worthwhile trade-off, especially for laptop use in environments with uncontrollable light sources. The article also details the specific, meticulous cleaning process required for the delicate surface, which involves using only the included cloth (or a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for tough smudges) and avoiding direct liquid application.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's findings but expands on several key practical and technical points. A prominent theme is the humor and frustration surrounding the specialized cleaning cloth, with users noting its high replacement cost ($19) and its inclusion in the box where stickers used to be.

Technically, commenters acknowledge that the nano-texture is a trade-off: it reduces glare but also lowers contrast and makes blacks appear more washed out than a glossy screen. One user criticized the article's photos for not demonstrating this contrast difference effectively, a point the author acknowledged. The consensus is that the nano-texture is ideal for productivity in bright environments, while glossy remains superior for media consumption or color-critical work in controlled lighting.

The discussion also delves into practical concerns and usage tips:
*   **Cleaning:** A debate emerged about using alcohol on screens. While Apple officially permits a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for the nano-texture, some users shared their long-term success with homemade alcohol-based cleaners on standard glossy screens, while others warned that alcohol can strip the oleophobic coating on devices like iPhones.
*   **Manufacturing:** Users clarified that Apple doesn't manufacture the panels themselves but holds patents on the nano-texture technology, which differentiates it from traditional matte screens.
*   **Alternatives:** One user mentioned using a DIY sunshield with magnets, presenting a low-cost alternative for glare reduction.
*   **Fingerprints:** A user with a nano-texture iPad Pro confirmed that fingerprints are not a significant issue and that the screen is easy to clean.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** A Wall Street Journal article reports on a study confirming that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are being paid primarily by American consumers and businesses, not by foreign exporters. The study reinforces standard economic theory that import taxes are passed down the supply chain, resulting in higher prices for U.S. buyers and increased costs for domestic manufacturers reliant on imported inputs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the tariffs, with a consensus that the economic burden falls on Americans. Commenters express frustration that the policy is widely misunderstood or misrepresented by its supporters. Several key themes emerged:

*   **Economic Reality vs. Political Spin:** Users argue that the tariffs function as a regressive tax on consumers. A poignant example shared by a user in the construction industry illustrates this cognitive dissonance: a contractor praised tariffs for making imported tools expensive enough to justify buying pricier American-made ones, ignoring that the increased cost ultimately hurts his own business margins and raises prices for his customers.
*   **Fiscal Impact:** There is skepticism regarding the revenue generated by tariffs. Users point out that the $90 billion collected is negligible compared to the federal deficit and military spending, suggesting the tariffs are insufficient to offset tax cuts for the wealthy or the national debt.
*   **Geopolitical Consequences:** Commenters worry that the trade war is accelerating the decline of U.S. global influence. There is a fear that allies are permanently shifting supply chains away from the U.S. to avoid future volatility, a trend that will persist even if the political administration changes.
*   **Manufacturing Strategy:** While some users acknowledge the goal of rebuilding an industrial base, others argue that the current approach is counterproductive because it taxes manufacturing *inputs*, making domestic production more expensive rather than competitive.

## [Nanolang: A tiny experimental language designed to be targeted by coding LLMs](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46684958

> **Article:** The article introduces Nanolang, an experimental programming language created by Jordan Hubbard (NVIDIA/FreeBSD) specifically designed to be targeted by coding LLMs. The language features a simple, Lisp-like syntax with S-expressions and requires that every function have tests that run at compile time. The project includes documentation aimed at teaching the language to LLMs, particularly a file called MEMORY.md that serves as a system prompt for AI models.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revealed several key perspectives on Nanolang's approach. Skepticism centered on whether creating a new language is necessary, with many commenters arguing that LLMs perform better with languages that have abundant training data (like Python or Lua) rather than novel languages. The compile-time testing requirement sparked debate about practicality—some feared it would create excessive "noise" in real-world code, while others noted similar approaches exist in educational languages like Pyret.

A notable experiment by commenter simonw tested whether an LLM could learn Nanolang from its documentation. While a one-shot attempt failed, giving the LLM access to the compiler and documentation allowed it to successfully generate working code, suggesting the concept is viable but requires proper tooling. Technical discussions touched on error handling patterns (comparing Nanolang's approach to Rust's) and whether the language should be a full Lisp rather than mixing S-expressions with imperative style.

Underlying themes included concerns about the "chicken-and-egg" problem of novel languages lacking training data, and whether the time for such innovations has passed given that modern LLMs handle syntax well. Some commenters appreciated the clean design and saw value in using AI to explore language ideas that would be too labor-intensive to implement manually.

## [The microstructure of wealth transfer in prediction markets](https://www.jbecker.dev/research/prediction-market-microstructure)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46680515

> **Article:** This research paper analyzes 72.1 million trades ($18.26 billion volume) on the prediction market Kalshi from 2021 to 2025 to understand the "microstructure" of wealth transfer. The study identifies a significant "longshot bias," where low-probability contracts are systematically overpriced. It finds a clear wealth transfer from liquidity takers (who lose -1.12% excess return) to liquidity makers (who gain +1.12%). A key driver is an "optimism tax": buying "Yes" contracts at 1 cent has a -41% expected value, while buying "No" at 1 cent has a +23% expected value. The inefficiency varies by category, with finance markets being relatively efficient while high-engagement categories like media and world events show large gaps. The mechanism for this transfer is not superior forecasting by makers, but rather their passive strategy of selling "Yes" contracts to optimistic bettors.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the implications of the paper's findings and the nature of prediction markets. Key themes included:

*   **Mechanism and Structure:** Users clarified the "Yes/No" asymmetry, explaining that on Kalshi, these are two sides of a single contract, which functions as a margin mechanism. This contrasts with platforms like Polymarket, where "Yes" and "No" are distinct products. The discussion also touched on how interest rates are handled, with Kalshi paying interest on open positions.

*   **Market Efficiency vs. Inefficiency:** The findings sparked a debate on market efficiency. One commenter argued that unlike casino games, prediction markets in an efficient state should return 100% to participants, implying the observed losses are due to inefficiency. Another countered that the very existence of profits in real-world markets proves they are inherently inefficient, a point the paper's data supports.

*   **Regulation and Gambling:** A significant thread debated the regulatory status of prediction markets. Some argued that strict financial regulations drive people toward actual gambling. However, others countered that modern prediction markets are largely sports gambling disguised as financial markets to exploit regulatory loopholes, and that the "thrill-seeking" motivations of gamblers are distinct from those of investors.

*   **Manipulation and Integrity:** Concerns were raised about the potential for manipulation, where powerful insiders could make lopsided bets on outcomes they control (e.g., influencing a game or a political statement). This was seen as a fundamental risk for outsiders.

*   **Potential and Criticism:** While some envisioned positive applications for prediction markets, such as using them to improve diligence in software development, others were skeptical about the practicalities. The discussion also included criticism of the industry's marketing, with users noting "skeezy" ads promising easy money, and skepticism about the current viability of using LLMs for automated trading.

## [There's a hidden Android setting that spots fake cell towers](https://www.howtogeek.com/theres-a-hidden-android-setting-that-spots-fake-cell-towers/)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46683833

> **Article:** The article from How-To Geek explains a hidden Android setting designed to detect fake cell towers (IMSI catchers or "stingrays"). It highlights that these malicious devices can intercept communications by forcing phones onto older, unencrypted protocols like 2G. The feature, part of "Mobile Network Security," is currently exclusive to the Pixel 10 series due to specific hardware requirements in the modem. The setting alerts users when connecting to a cell tower that lacks a digital certificate, indicating a potential security risk. The article contrasts this with iOS, which only allows disabling 2G connections via a restrictive "Lockdown Mode."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply concerned with mobile network security, though skeptical of the practical utility of the new Android feature. A central theme is the limitation of the hardware requirement; users note that the full security suite is exclusive to the Pixel 10 series, leaving older Android devices and iPhones vulnerable. While iOS allows disabling 2G, commenters point out that this is only accessible via "Lockdown Mode," which severely limits other functionalities, making it impractical for daily use.

There is significant debate regarding the effectiveness of simply disabling 2G. While some argue this is a sufficient preventative measure, others highlight that many modern phones and network menus do not offer a true "4G/LTE only" option, forcing users to remain exposed to older, insecure protocols even in regions where 2G is technically obsolete.

The discussion also touches on the broader implications of fake towers. Users express cynicism about the ability to act on the alerts, noting that IMSI catchers are likely ubiquitous in metropolitan areas and that reporting them to authorities is futile. There is a consensus that while the notification is a step forward, it lacks an actionable "Allow/Deny" mechanism, meaning data may already be intercepted by the time the user is alerted. Finally, commenters referenced an open-source tool called Rayhunter by the EFF as an alternative method for monitoring network security.

## [Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46678550

> **Question:** An Ask HN question inquiring about the impact of AI coding tools on developers who work with the COBOL programming language.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revealed a mixed and nuanced view of AI's role in the COBOL ecosystem. One developer in banking reported positive experiences, noting that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax aligns well with LLMs, and their team uses fine-tuned models for their codebase. However, others, particularly those working with older or proprietary mainframe versions, found AI less effective due to a lack of training data and the unique complexities of legacy systems. A common theme was that AI is best used as an assistant for tedious tasks, such as generating file layouts or acting as an advanced search tool for documentation, rather than for producing production-ready code in one shot.

Broader points were raised about the nature of AI in programming. Several commenters argued that the effectiveness of AI is highly dependent on the user's ability to provide detailed prompts and to act as an architect who thoroughly reviews the generated code. Skepticism was voiced about AI's ability to handle complex, mission-critical systems without human oversight, with one user stating they would not want "vibe-coded" COBOL in a bank's database. The conversation also touched on the staying power of COBOL and Fortran due to their massive, critical installed codebases, and a debate emerged comparing the deterministic nature of compilers to the probabilistic output of LLMs.

## [Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46683947

> **Article:** A TechCrunch article reports that Meta's Threads has surpassed X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile users, citing data from Sensor Tower. The article notes that X's daily active users in the U.S. have halved over the past year, dropping from approximately 150 million to 125 million globally. It highlights Threads' significant advantage in user acquisition through its integration with Instagram's 2 billion-user base, though it acknowledges that Threads still lags behind X in overall time spent on the platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a skeptical and multifaceted critique of the report, centering on data interpretation, platform quality, and the broader social media landscape.

Users immediately questioned the data's validity, noting discrepancies between the article's claim of a 50% drop in X's U.S. users and the provided graph, which showed a more modest global decline. There was a consensus that X's user base is likely inflated by bots and abandoned accounts, with many active users being passive "lurkers" rather than creators. The discussion also highlighted that Threads' growth is heavily fueled by Meta's ecosystem, specifically mandatory Instagram integration and aggressive cross-promotion, which some argue skews the "daily active user" comparison.

The conversation frequently shifted to the qualitative differences between the platforms. Many commenters expressed a preference for X (despite its flaws) due to its utility for real-time news and niche tech discussions, whereas Threads was described as having a more generic, "comments-section" feel. The "walled garden" nature of both platforms was a point of contention; while one user criticized the shift from one corporate silo to another, others defended Threads for its ActivityPub integration, positioning it as a bridge to the Fediverse.

Finally, the discussion broadened to the state of social media generally. Several users lamented the consolidation of power among tech billionaires and expressed a desire for decentralized alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon. The decline of X was attributed not only to management changes but also to the broader shift in user attention toward short-form video platforms like TikTok.
