## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 733 | **Comments:** 733 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 US tariffs. It concludes that, contrary to claims that foreign exporters pay the tariffs, the costs are primarily borne by American importers and consumers. The analysis uses event studies of previous tariff shocks (e.g., on Brazil and India) to show that export prices from the affected countries did not decrease; instead, trade volumes collapsed. The article argues that the tariffs function as a tax on Americans, leading to higher prices and reduced trade, rather than generating revenue from foreign nations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's economic conclusions while exploring the political and psychological reasons behind the tariff policy. A central theme is the consensus that tariffs are effectively a tax on domestic consumers, a concept described by multiple users as "Economics 101." Many commenters express frustration that the public or political leadership misunderstands this basic mechanism, with some attributing this to partisan media narratives.

The conversation also delves into the political motivations and consequences of the tariffs. Several users speculate that the trade war is intentionally designed to disrupt the global economy, with one user suggesting it serves the interests of foreign adversaries like Russia. Others discuss the legal precariousness of the tariffs, noting potential Supreme Court intervention and the administration's reported contingency plans to replace justices if rulings go against them. The unpredictability of the policy is highlighted as a major deterrent to business investment, undermining the stated goal of boosting domestic manufacturing.

Finally, there is a debate regarding the nuances of tax incidence and global trade imbalances. While the majority view is that consumers bear the cost, some users argue that market elasticity and supply chain dynamics can shift the burden, citing China's export prices to other countries. A minority of comments attempt to justify tariffs as a necessary, albeit crude, tool to address global trade imbalances and the dominance of the US dollar, though this view is contested by others who view the policy as purely detrimental.

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 504 | **Comments:** 170 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article is a news alert from the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, dated January 19, 2026, announcing that a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm level has been reached. This is a significant solar radiation event, indicating a major disturbance in Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar flare or coronal mass ejection. The alert serves as an official warning about the potential for widespread voltage control problems and possible grid instability, particularly for high-latitude power systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of real-time observations, technical critiques, and practical advice. A key theme is the accessibility failure of the official NOAA warning page, which users pointed out presented critical information as an image without text, making it inaccessible to screen readers. This sparked a brief but pointed debate about the standards of government websites.

The majority of the conversation, however, is focused on the visible effects of the storm. Users from across the US and Europe (Germany, Netherlands, Austria) reported seeing spectacular auroras, with some noting they were visible as far south as Munich. A sub-thread developed around the technicalities of photographing the aurora, with users sharing tips on long exposure and noting that the intensity of the storm made it visible even with light pollution and to the naked eye.

There was also some discussion about the technical scale of the event. One user provided a link to the NOAA scale explanation, while another contextualized the storm's severity (Kp 8.67) by comparing it to the historic Carrington event (Kp 9). A user monitoring the PJM Interconnection grid reported that while warnings were issued, no grid re-configurations or major problems occurred in the US. Finally, the conversation touched on preparedness, with one user asking about plans for a more severe event, to which the general advice was to have a few days of food and water on hand. The overall tone was more one of curiosity and awe ("cool night lights") rather than alarm, with users clarifying that the "blaring klaxons" were more relevant to power operators and those in space than to the general public.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 464 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is the full text of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his nonviolent protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter defends the strategy of direct action against racial injustice. King argues for the moral obligation to disobey unjust laws, distinguishing between just and unjust laws. He expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate" who prioritizes order over justice and warns against the myth that time alone will cure societal ills. The letter is a foundational text of the Civil Rights Movement, articulating the philosophy of civil disobedience and the urgency of now.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the enduring relevance of King's letter, with users analyzing its philosophical arguments and applying them to contemporary political and social issues.

Key themes include:

*   **The Philosophy of Civil Disobedience:** Many commenters highlight King's distinction between just and unjust laws, particularly his argument that breaking an unjust law "openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty" expresses the highest respect for law. This is seen as a classic and timeless principle of civil disobedience, with some connecting it to Thoreau and the founding principles of the United States.

*   **Historical Context and Nonviolence:** A significant point of debate is the historical context of the Civil Rights Movement. One commenter argues that the focus on King's nonviolent approach is a "white washed" narrative that omits the concurrent, armed self-defense advocated by figures like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, suggesting King's "carrot" of nonviolence was effective partly because of the "stick" of potential violence from other groups. Others discuss the importance of organization and nonviolence training, contrasting the disciplined protests of the 1960s with more chaotic modern movements.

*   **The "White Moderate" and Modern Politics:** Several users find King's critique of the "white moderate"—who prefers order to justice and is more frustrated by protest methods than by injustice itself—to be strikingly relevant today. This is explicitly applied to current American politics, particularly the internal schism within the Democratic Party between "liberals" and "leftists." Commenters draw parallels between the "white moderate" and modern figures who advocate for reforming institutions like ICE rather than abolishing them, viewing this as a defense of the status quo.

*   **Timelessness and Personal Impact:** The letter is widely praised as a "timeless banger" and a "masterclass" in influence. Many commenters share personal stories of being required to read the letter in school and how it left a lasting, formative impression, challenging their understanding of authority and justice. The annual tradition of rereading it is mentioned multiple times, with users noting they discover new insights with each reading.

*   **Application to Contemporary Events:** The letter's principles are applied to recent events, including the January 6th Capitol attack (with a debate on whether it constituted legitimate civil disobedience) and the murder of a woman by an ICE agent (with a discussion on whether reform or abolition is the appropriate response).

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 446 | **Comments:** 363 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the line between search results and advertisements. The change involves displaying ad listings with a blue background, making them visually similar to organic search results, which critics argue is a deceptive "dark pattern" designed to increase click-through rates and boost Apple's ad revenue.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant negativity, viewing the design change as a classic example of "enshittification"—the gradual degradation of a user experience in favor of monetization. Commenters expressed disappointment that Apple, once a champion of user experience, is succumbing to the same ad-driven pressures as its competitors.

A central theme was the erosion of Apple's "walled garden" value proposition. Users argued that if the App Store becomes cluttered with deceptive ads and scams—similar to the Google Play Store or Amazon—there is less incentive to stay within the Apple ecosystem. Many noted that the App Store already suffers from a proliferation of copycat apps and scams, and this change exacerbates those safety concerns rather than solving them.

There was also a broader economic discussion regarding corporate growth. Several users argued that capitalism inevitably forces even successful companies to prioritize infinite revenue growth over product quality once market saturation is reached. The discussion concluded with a sense of resignation; while users are frustrated by the decline in quality, the consensus was that most consumers are locked into the ecosystem and unlikely to switch platforms despite these changes.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 395 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** The Cloudflare blog post details an incident where a change to their authoritative DNS servers caused widespread outages. The change involved reordering the Resource Records (RRs) in DNS responses, specifically placing A records before CNAME records. While Cloudflare interpreted the relevant RFCs (1034 and 1035) as not mandating a specific order, this new ordering broke several common DNS clients, including the `getaddrinfo` function in the GNU C Library (glibc) and the DNS client in certain Cisco switches. The root cause was identified as ambiguous language in the RFCs, which Cloudflare plans to clarify with a new standard. The incident highlights the challenge of maintaining backward compatibility with implementations that rely on de-facto standards, even when those standards are not explicitly defined in official specifications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the nature of the failure and the validity of Cloudflare's reasoning. A central theme was the criticism of Cloudflare for not having adequate testing. Many commenters expressed surprise that a company of Cloudflare's scale would deploy a change without testing it against a major client implementation like glibc, with one user calling it a failure to follow standard testing practices.

A significant portion of the debate revolved around the ambiguity of the RFCs. Several commenters argued that the RFC language is actually quite clear, stating that CNAMEs should "preface" the final answer, which implies a specific order. They contended that Cloudflare's interpretation was a misreading and that the "possibly" in the text refers to the presence of CNAMEs, not their placement. Others, however, acknowledged that while the CNAME/A order might be specified, the ordering within a CNAME chain is less clear, introducing some ambiguity.

The discussion also touched on broader engineering principles. One commenter invoked Hyrum's Law and Postel's Law (the robustness principle), noting that while Postel's Law is now considered potentially harmful, this incident is a classic example of its value: being liberal in what you accept would have prevented the glibc resolver from breaking. The community consensus was that Cloudflare made the correct pragmatic decision to revert the change and update the standard to match the de-facto behavior of existing clients, rather than trying to force a change that would break countless devices in the field.

## [The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button](https://paulmakeswebsites.com/writing/shadcn-radio-button/)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 203 | **ID:** 46688971

> **Article:** The article "The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button" critiques the implementation of a radio button component within the popular UI library Shadcn. The author argues that the component is excessively complex, requiring over 200 lines of code and 7 imports. The piece contrasts this with the simplicity of a native HTML radio button styled with modern CSS. It suggests that while complex solutions were necessary in the past to ensure cross-browser consistency and custom styling, modern CSS capabilities have largely eliminated the need for such heavy, JavaScript-dependent solutions. The author concludes that this over-engineering contributes to "code rot" and unnecessary maintenance burdens.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revealed a multifaceted debate on the state of modern front-end development, centering on the trade-offs between control, complexity, and practicality.

A primary theme was the critique of over-engineering. Many commenters agreed with the article's sentiment, expressing frustration with the bloat of modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries. They argued that for simple elements like radio buttons, modern CSS is often sufficient, and that the industry has developed a habit of adding unnecessary layers of abstraction. This was framed as a form of "code rot" or "Shiny Object Syndrome," where developers, particularly juniors, adopt trendy tools without questioning their necessity, leading to inflated codebases and maintenance burdens.

Conversely, several users defended the Shadcn/Radix approach by highlighting the practical problems these libraries solve. They pointed out that achieving consistent cross-browser styling, accessibility features (like keyboard navigation), and complex interactivity with vanilla CSS can be surprisingly difficult. The complexity, they argued, is a trade-off for reliability and a superior user experience that goes beyond simple visual appearance.

The discussion also delved into the specific philosophy of Shadcn. Some commenters were confused by its model of copying code into a project versus simply importing a library, questioning why one would voluntarily take on a maintenance burden. Others countered that this approach offers the "best of both worlds": the power and customizability of a component library without being locked into its update cycle or having to deal with opaque, minified code in `node_modules`. It was also noted that Shadcn itself is a wrapper around other libraries like Radix UI, which handle the underlying logic.

Finally, the conversation touched on the broader state of the front-end ecosystem. Commenters lamented the lack of stability and the constant churn of frameworks, contrasting it with more mature ecosystems. The debate ultimately highlighted a core tension: the desire for simplicity and performance versus the need for robust, accessible, and consistently styled components in complex web applications.

## [Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html)
**Score:** 366 | **Comments:** 487 | **ID:** 46686640

> **Article:** Porsche announced that in 2025, it sold more "electrified" vehicles (battery-electric and plug-in hybrids) in Europe than pure internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. The company delivered 310,718 vehicles worldwide, a 3% decrease year-over-year, with significant declines in China (-26%) and overall worldwide sales (-10%). Despite the shift toward electrification, the company is facing financial pressure and has reportedly delayed some EV projects in favor of hybrid and ICE options.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on three main themes: the strategic implications of Porsche's sales data, the shifting global automotive landscape, and the future of the luxury car brand itself.

Many commenters immediately clarified that "electrified" includes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), not just pure EVs, and noted that Porsche's overall sales actually declined. This context shifted the focus from a pure EV victory to a broader industry struggle. The decline in sales, particularly in China, was highlighted as a critical data point. Users noted that Chinese automakers like BYD are not just dominating the EV niche but are positioning themselves to challenge established giants like Toyota for the global market share.

The conversation also touched on the changing nature of car manufacturing. Some argued that the advantage in car manufacturing is fleeting as robotics and new technologies rapidly evolve, potentially leveling the playing field between legacy automakers and new entrants.

Finally, there was significant debate regarding Porsche's brand identity and product appeal. Several commenters expressed concern that Porsche's transition to EVs and SUVs has diluted its iconic sports car heritage, making the vehicles feel like generic "appliances." Critics argued that current Porsche EVs lack the technological edge of Chinese competitors and suffer from poor design choices (e.g., replacing physical buttons with screens). Conversely, others defended the move as a necessary evolution for a luxury brand, suggesting that Porsche's marque retains value as a Veblen good regardless of the powertrain. However, the prevailing sentiment was skepticism about the long-term viability of German luxury brands in the face of rising Chinese competition and reliability concerns.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 356 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-source large language model (LLM) released by z.ai (GLM). It is a 31B parameter model, likely a distilled or "Flash" variant of the larger GLM-4.7 model. The release is positioned as a smaller, more efficient model capable of running locally on consumer hardware while offering competitive performance on coding benchmarks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the model's accessibility, performance relative to established benchmarks, and practical utility for local deployment. Commenters are actively exploring how to run the model, sharing immediate resources for cloud access and local quantization.

Key themes include:
*   **Performance and Benchmarks:** Users are comparing GLM-4.7-Flash to proprietary models like GPT-4o mini and o3. While some note that open models generally lag behind closed ones by about a year, others highlight that this 31B model reportedly achieves coding scores (SWE-Bench) comparable to much larger models, making it a significant candidate for local experimentation. However, skepticism remains regarding benchmark validity, with one user noting it appears "marginally better" than GPT-OSS 20B despite being significantly larger in file size.
*   **Local Deployment and Accessibility:** There is strong interest in running the model locally on consumer hardware (e.g., MacBooks, 32GB VRAM GPUs). Users quickly shared quantized versions (GGUF) via Hugging Face and provided specific command-line instructions for running the model using `llama.cpp`.
*   **Cost and Cloud Providers:** Early adopters are identifying cloud providers offering the model (z.ai, Novita, OpenRouter). However, one user shared a negative experience with Cerebras, citing strict rate limits and high costs due to a lack of token caching, suggesting that while the model is fast, the infrastructure surrounding it may not yet be cost-effective for practical usage.
*   **Use Cases:** The model is viewed as ideal for fine-tuning experiments and simple coding tasks (e.g., writing tests). While some argue that sub-70B models are insufficient for complex reasoning, others find the 31B size perfect for local workflows where waiting for larger cloud models (like Codex) is a bottleneck.

## [Nova Launcher added Facebook and Google Ads tracking](https://lemdro.id/post/lemdro.id/35049920)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46686655

> **Article:** The article reports that Nova Launcher, a popular custom launcher for Android, has introduced tracking and advertising SDKs in its latest updates. This change follows the app's acquisition by a new company. The update (version 8.2.4) added Facebook Ads and Google AdMob SDKs, along with permissions for analytics and crash reporting tools like Branch, Bugsnag, Google CrashLytics, and Google Firebase Analytics.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with disappointment and concern over the privacy implications of Nova Launcher's update. Many users expressed a desire to switch to alternatives, with several open-source options like Lawnchair being recommended, though some noted it isn't available on F-Droid. A key debate emerged around the security of continuing to use older versions of Nova; while some users plan to stick with older, network-blocked versions, others warned that unsupported software can become a security risk over time.

Practical solutions were shared for privacy-conscious users, particularly those on GrapheneOS, who can block the app's network access entirely. The discussion also touched on performance issues, with one user linking their phone's recent lag to the update. Ultimately, while many praised Nova's past functionality, the consensus was that the addition of trackers was a significant breach of trust, prompting a search for new, privacy-respecting launchers.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint analyzing research on social media platforms found that nearly a third of studies have undisclosed ties to industry. The study claims that while half of the research published in top journals has disclosable industry connections (funding, collaboration, or employment), the majority of these are not declared in the published work. The research suggests that industry-tied studies garner more attention and focus less on platform-scale impacts, and that undisclosed ties are common among reviewers and editors as well. The authors argue for strengthened disclosure norms to ensure research integrity.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was largely cynical and unsurprised, with many commenters viewing the findings as an inevitable result of the current research funding landscape. A recurring theme was the comparison to other industries—such as pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels, and tobacco—where corporate influence on research is a well-documented issue. Several users expressed a sense of distrust in institutions and a desire to disconnect from the digital ecosystem, suggesting practical steps like adding "friction" to social media usage to reduce mindless consumption.

There was also debate regarding the ethics of corporate research versus academic oversight. One commenter argued that social media companies operate without the strict ethical committees that govern academic research, allowing them to experiment on populations without consent. This sparked a counter-argument that academic ethics bodies are often overly bureaucratic and that private sector research is more efficient. Others noted the practical reality that industry often possesses the necessary data and funding that academia lacks, making collaboration essential but fraught with conflict of interest. The conversation concluded with a meta-discussion about the credibility of the study itself and a humorous reference to the film *Thank You for Smoking*.

## [Reticulum, a secure and anonymous mesh networking stack](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46686273

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for Reticulum, a secure and anonymous mesh networking stack. It is presented as a full alternative to the TCP/IP stack, designed to operate over diverse physical link types including LoRa, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and even serial connections. The stack uses cryptographic key pairs for node identity rather than IP addresses, allowing for resilient routing across mixed network topologies. The project recently reached version 1.0.0, and the author highlights companion applications like "MeshChat" and "Sideband" (for Android) that utilize Reticulum's protocols (LXMF for messaging) to send data, photos, and voice over these meshes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with interest, noting the project's relevance for secure, decentralized communication, though several technical and project health concerns were raised.

**Technical Capabilities and Use Cases**
Users discussed the stack's flexibility, noting it runs on any device supporting Python 3.8+. It supports a wide variety of interfaces, including LoRa (via RNode), Ethernet (via AutoInterface using IPv6), TCP/UDP, I2P, and even pipe interfaces for custom transports like SSH tunnels. A key distinction made between Reticulum and similar projects like Meshtastic is that Reticulum is a generic network stack, whereas Meshtastic is a specific chat application limited to LoRa. Commenters emphasized Reticulum's ability to seamlessly bridge different link types (e.g., LoRa to Internet to Ham Radio) and its theoretical limit of 128 hops, compared to Meshtastic's 7.

**Project Health and Maintenance**
A significant portion of the discussion focused on the project's sustainability. While the tech was praised, users noted that it is largely a one-man project. Concerns were raised about opaque commit messages (e.g., "Update") making it hard to track changes. Most notably, a recent announcement revealed that the maintainer is stepping back from public-facing interaction, support, and community management, though occasional code updates may still occur. This has caused some hesitation among potential adopters.

**Licensing and Ideology**
The project includes a license clause prohibiting use in the creation of AI/ML training datasets. While some users questioned the enforceability given the code is hosted on GitHub (which has its own terms), others noted that the developer has a strong ideological background detailed in a "Zen of Reticulum" manifesto, which drives the project's philosophy beyond just the code.

**Onboarding and Accessibility**
New users asked about the learning curve. It was clarified that while the network stack itself is the foundation, applications like MeshChat provide a user-friendly entry point. However, because it is a distinct network stack, end-users must install Reticulum-compatible software to participate, rather than accessing services via a standard web browser.

## [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46682518

> **Article:** The article "Notes on Apple's Nano Texture" provides a hands-on review of Apple's anti-glare nano-texture display coating, available on high-end Macs and iPads. The author evaluates its performance in various lighting conditions, comparing it to standard glossy screens. The key finding is a significant reduction in reflections, making the display much more usable in bright or mixed-light environments, though this comes with a trade-off: a slight reduction in perceived contrast and black levels compared to glossy displays. The author concludes that for many professional and mobile use cases, the anti-glare benefits outweigh the minor loss in contrast, making it a worthwhile upgrade.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the practical trade-offs of the nano-texture coating, with a strong focus on maintenance and cleaning. A primary point of conversation is the specialized cleaning cloth that comes with the display; users humorously noted its high replacement cost ($19) from Apple, highlighting the product's premium nature. The debate then shifted to proper cleaning methods, with users sharing advice on using a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for stubborn smudges, while others cautioned that alcohol can damage oleophobic coatings on other devices.

Beyond maintenance, users debated the core performance trade-off: glare reduction versus contrast. While the original article lacked direct contrast comparisons, commenters confirmed that nano-texture inherently reduces contrast and makes blacks appear "washed out" compared to glossy screens. However, many argued this is a worthwhile compromise, as the elimination of harsh reflections significantly improves comfort in real-world, non-ideal lighting. The discussion also touched on the lack of nano-texture for the MacBook Air, its effectiveness on iPads for reducing fingerprints, and one user's long-term, DIY alternative for anti-glare protection.

## [The microstructure of wealth transfer in prediction markets](https://www.jbecker.dev/research/prediction-market-microstructure)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46680515

> **Article:** The article analyzes 72.1 million trades and $18.26 billion in volume on the prediction market Kalshi from 2021 to 2025. It identifies several key inefficiencies in the market. A "longshot bias" is present, where low-probability contracts are systematically overpriced. There is a significant wealth transfer from liquidity takers (who lose an average of 1.12% excess return) to liquidity makers (who gain it). This is driven by an "optimism tax," where buying "Yes" contracts has a negative expected value, while buying "No" contracts is profitable. The inefficiency varies by category, with finance markets being relatively efficient while high-engagement categories like media and world events show large gaps. The study concludes that makers profit not by having superior forecasts, but by passively selling "Yes" contracts to optimistic bettors.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News focused on the practical implications and broader context of the study's findings. A central theme was clarifying the mechanics of prediction markets, particularly the "Yes/No" structure. Commenters explained that this is how platforms like Kalshi handle margin, allowing users to sell contracts without owning a position first, and that fees often prevent simple arbitrage between the "Yes" and "No" sides of a contract.

The nature of market efficiency was heavily debated. While one commenter argued that truly efficient markets would offer no profit, another countered that real-world markets are far from perfectly efficient, which is precisely where profit opportunities (like those identified in the study) exist. The discussion also touched on practical factors like interest rates on open positions and the potential future role of LLM-driven trading bots.

Broader concerns about the industry were raised. Several users expressed unease with the aggressive, "get-rich-quick" marketing tactics used by prediction market platforms, comparing them to gambling. The potential for manipulation was a significant point, with commenters worried about powerful individuals making lopsided bets on events they can influence. Finally, the conversation included a debate on regulation, with some arguing for fewer financial gatekeepers and others contending that prediction markets are often just sports gambling in disguise, exploiting regulatory loopholes.

## [Nanolang: A tiny experimental language designed to be targeted by coding LLMs](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46684958

> **Article:** The article introduces "Nanolang," an experimental programming language designed specifically to be targeted by coding LLMs. Created by Jordan Hubbard (known for FreeBSD and NVIDIA), the language aims to be simple and predictable for AI models to generate and understand. It features a Lisp-like syntax, strict typing, and a unique requirement that every function must have tests that run at compile time. The project is available on GitHub, and the author provided a specific Markdown file (`MEMORY.md`) intended to serve as a concise reference for teaching the language to an LLM.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practicality of creating a custom language for LLMs versus using existing ones, the feasibility of its mandatory testing feature, and a real-world test of its teachability.

Key themes included:
*   **LLM Training Data vs. Simplicity:** Several commenters argued that LLMs perform best with languages that are heavily represented in their training data (like Python or Lisp). They suggested that a novel language, even if simpler, might be harder for an LLM to generate correctly than a more complex but familiar one.
*   **Mandatory Testing:** The requirement for compile-time tests was a major point of discussion. While some found it novel (comparing it to the Pyret teaching language), others were skeptical, predicting it would lead to "noisy" code or require cumbersome workarounds like "shadow" functions to satisfy the compiler.
*   **Syntax and Design:** The Lisp-like syntax was generally viewed positively. However, some suggested that a pure AST representation (like a typed Lisp) might be even better for LLMs, while others felt the time for such custom languages had passed, as modern LLMs are less bothered by syntax.
*   **Practical Experiment:** A user (simonw) tested the language by giving Claude Opus the `MEMORY.md` file and asking it to build a Mandelbrot fractal generator. The initial one-shot attempt failed, but the LLM succeeded when given access to the compiler and the ability to iterate on the code. This experiment highlighted that while an LLM can learn the language, it may require more context and an iterative process than a simple prompt.
*   **Error Handling:** A side discussion emerged about error handling in Rust, with a commenter proposing a "context" command to improve developer intention in error messages, which was compared to existing Rust crates like `anyhow`.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports on a study confirming that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are being paid primarily by American consumers and businesses, not by foreign exporters. The study provides evidence that the costs of these tariffs are being passed through the supply chain, resulting in higher prices for imported goods and inputs for U.S. manufacturers, ultimately acting as a tax on the U.S. economy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the tariffs, treating the study's findings as a confirmation of basic economic principles rather than a revelation. The consensus is that tariffs function as a tax on Americans, increasing costs for both consumers and domestic manufacturers who rely on imported inputs.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Economic Impact:** Commenters express frustration that the tariffs are raising the cost of manufacturing in the U.S. by taxing raw materials and components. One user proposes a counter-intuitive idea: instead of tariffs, the U.S. should subsidize exports to gain global market share, similar to strategies used by other nations.
*   **Political Psychology:** A significant portion of the debate focuses on the political reception of the tariffs. Users analyze how supporters rationalize the increased costs, with one sharing an anecdote about a contractor who now finds it easier to justify buying expensive American-made tools because the cheaper imported alternatives have been priced up by tariffs. This is framed as a form of cognitive dissonance or media-driven "brainwashing."
*   **Fiscal Policy:** The conversation connects tariffs to broader fiscal issues. Users argue the tariffs are a regressive tax designed to offset revenue losses from tax cuts for the wealthy, noting that tariff revenue is a fraction of the massive federal deficit.
*   **Geopolitical Consequences:** There is a strong sense of pessimism regarding the U.S.'s global standing. Commenters worry that the trade war is accelerating the decline of American influence, pushing other nations to develop independent supply chains that will permanently bypass the U.S. Some express a feeling of helplessness, viewing the policies as chaotic and self-destructive.

## [There's a hidden Android setting that spots fake cell towers](https://www.howtogeek.com/theres-a-hidden-android-setting-that-spots-fake-cell-towers/)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46683833

> **Article:** The article highlights a hidden Android setting, primarily available on the Pixel 10 series, that alerts users when their phone connects to a cell tower that lacks a digital certificate. This feature helps identify "fake" cell towers (stingrays/IMSI catchers) which often operate by downgrading connections to unencrypted 2G protocols. The piece contrasts this with iOS, which only allows disabling 2G connections via a restrictive "Lockdown Mode," and notes that while disabling 2G entirely is a strong defense, many modern Android phones lack the option to do so without sacrificing network access.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the practical utility and limitations of detecting fake cell towers. A primary theme is the debate between detection versus prevention; many users noted that simply being alerted to a fake tower is insufficient because the connection has already been compromised. Consequently, the most effective defense is disabling 2G connectivity entirely to prevent downgrade attacks. However, a significant pain point emerged: many modern Android phones (including flagship Samsung models) and iPhones (without Lockdown Mode enabled) do not allow users to disable 2G/3G fallback, forcing them to remain vulnerable.

Users also debated the hardware requirements, clarifying that these advanced security features are currently exclusive to newer Pixel devices (specifically the Pixel 10, though some debate the Pixel 9 Pro's capabilities). There was a cynical consensus regarding the prevalence of these towers, with commenters suggesting that detection is often futile because law enforcement usage is widespread and reporting them achieves nothing. Finally, the conversation touched on the broader context of surveillance, with some users expressing resignation to government control over telecommunications, while others highlighted the trade-offs between security and practical concerns like battery life on older 2G brick phones.

## [Giving university exams in the age of chatbots](https://ploum.net/2026-01-19-exam-with-chatbots.html)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46688954

> **Article:** The article, written by a university professor for a course on "Open Source Strategies," details his experiment in adapting exams for the age of AI chatbots. Faced with the reality that traditional exams are easily solved by LLMs, he designed a new exam format with three key rules: 1) Students could use any tool, including chatbots. 2) They were allowed to discuss the exam questions with each other during the test. 3) Any mistakes taken directly from a chatbot would be penalized more heavily than mistakes made without assistance. The professor's goal was to shift the focus from rote knowledge to critical evaluation, forcing students to verify, curate, and take ownership of the information they used. He also hoped to understand student perspectives on these tools. The experiment yielded limited data, with only two students openly using an LLM, but provided valuable insights for future iterations of the course.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical and philosophical challenges of educating students in an era of ubiquitous AI. A primary theme was the rapid and growing dependency of students on LLMs. While the original article noted most students were hesitant to use chatbots, a university professor in the comments countered that this is changing "exponentially," with younger students increasingly using LLMs as a "crutch" and risking a future where they are unable to work without them.

Many commenters, particularly those who graduated years ago, reflected on how their own education would be impacted. Some argued that traditional, in-person written exams were becoming the last bastion of LLM-proof assessment, while assignments submitted online were now trivial for AI to complete. This led to a broader debate on the purpose of higher education itself. One prominent viewpoint advocated for a return to more rigorous, traditional methods like closed-book exams, oral examinations, and extensive problem sets to rebuild foundational knowledge and creativity, arguing that "memorization is a prerequisite for creativity." Conversely, others suggested that education should evolve to focus on building portfolios and using all available tools, as AI is unlocking new domains and increasing the need for broad, integrated knowledge rather than narrow specialization.

The professor's specific exam rules were a point of keen interest. The policy of penalizing chatbot mistakes more severely was widely seen as ingenious. Commenters reasoned that this approach correctly distinguishes between a student's genuine misunderstanding and a failure to critically evaluate an AI's output, thereby rewarding the crucial skill of verification. The rule allowing student collaboration also sparked curiosity, with some questioning whether a group diploma would be more appropriate for such a model.

Finally, there was a consensus that the educational system is in a period of necessary and rapid experimentation. While some expressed pessimism about institutional inertia, many admired the professor's adaptive and mindful approach. The discussion concluded with a sense that the core challenge is shifting from knowledge acquisition to teaching students how to critically assess, synthesize, and take ownership of information generated by powerful but fallible AI tools.

## [Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46683947

> **Article:** The article from TechCrunch reports that Threads has surpassed X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile users, according to new data. It highlights that while X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. a year ago, that gap has closed significantly. The report notes that Threads benefits from a massive user funnel through its integration with Instagram, which has over 2 billion users, allowing for constant cross-promotion and easy sign-ups.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply skeptical of the reported metrics and the broader implications of the platforms' competition. A central theme is the questioning of X's user statistics, with several commenters suggesting the platform is filled with bots and abandoned accounts, making the reported 561 million active users feel inflated. They point to declining engagement and impressions as anecdotal evidence of a shrinking real user base.

Regarding Threads, the growth is often attributed to its strategic advantage of being integrated with Instagram, providing a massive distribution funnel that X lacks. However, some users remain critical, viewing it as just another "walled garden" in a consolidated social media landscape dominated by Meta. This sentiment is countered by the point that Threads is built on ActivityPub, giving it Fediverse integration and making it less of a walled garden than platforms like X.

The discussion also explores the reasons for X's perceived decline, citing its shift towards a right-wing orientation, alienating a significant portion of its audience, and competition from short-form video platforms like TikTok. Alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon are mentioned as more promising, decentralized options. While some users have already left X for Threads or a social media hiatus, others find value in specific niches on X (like the AI/tech community) and are exploring Bluesky as a viable alternative that recaptures the feel of early Twitter.

## [Simple Sabotage Field Manual (1944) [pdf]](https://www.cia.gov/static/5c875f3ec660e092cf893f60b4a288df/SimpleSabotage.pdf)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46684335

> **Article:** The article links to a declassified PDF of the "Simple Sabotage Field Manual" from 1944, published by the CIA. The manual was created by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor to the CIA, to instruct agents on how to disrupt enemy organizations and infrastructure. It covers general sabotage methods (e.g., damaging machinery, disrupting communications) and specific techniques for various industries like transportation and utilities. A notable section details "Wholehearted" sabotage tactics applicable to any organization, such as promoting inefficiency, encouraging confusion, and obstructing decision-making processes.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the manual's historical context, its surprising relevance to modern corporate life, and the implications of accessing such documents. A recurring theme was the observation that the sabotage techniques—particularly those in the "Managers and Supervisors" section—read like a guide to dysfunctional workplace behavior. Users humorously noted that many colleagues seem to follow these tactics unintentionally, with one user comparing the section to a "reverse Joel Test" for software development jobs.

There was also a mix of humor and paranoia regarding the act of downloading the manual from the CIA's website. Some commenters joked about ending up on government watch lists, while others pointed out that mass surveillance likely makes such concerns moot. A few users shared links to alternative sources, like the Internet Archive, and pointed to other declassified documents available in the CIA's reading room, such as those related to remote viewing programs.

The conversation briefly touched on broader societal implications, with one user expressing a cynical view that modern society has effectively "gamified" these destructive tactics for entertainment. Overall, the tone was lighthearted and analytical, focusing on the manual's accidental utility as a lens for examining bureaucratic inefficiency.

## [Fix your robots.txt or your site disappears from Google](https://www.alanwsmith.com/en/37/wa/jz/s1/)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46681454

> **Article:** The article, reportedly from a "Diamond Product Expert," claims that Google has changed its policy: if a website's `robots.txt` file is unreachable (e.g., returns a 404 error), Googlebot will stop crawling the entire site, rendering it invisible in search results. The article frames this as a necessary step to ensure Google respects site owners' wishes, implying that a missing `robots.txt` should be interpreted as a request to disallow crawling.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant skepticism and criticism toward the article's claims. The primary point of contention is the validity of the information; several users noted that the source is a "Diamond Product Expert" (an unpaid community role) rather than official Google documentation, and personal anecdotes suggest sites without `robots.txt` files are still indexed. Users also pointed out that Google's existing documentation contradicts the article's absolute claim, stating that pages can still be indexed via external links even if not crawled.

Beyond the factual debate, the discussion highlighted broader frustrations with Google's ecosystem. Commenters expressed confusion over Google's dual behavior regarding AI scraping versus search indexing, noting that Googlebot often ignores `robots.txt` for its AI models. There was also significant backlash against the perceived "enshittification" of Google Search, with some users viewing this potential change as a way for Google to force compliance or as a sign of the search engine's declining reliability. Finally, the conversation touched on the impact of AI summaries on website traffic, with some users admitting they no longer click through to sites if an AI summary provides the answer.
