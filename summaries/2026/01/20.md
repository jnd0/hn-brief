## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 682 | **Comments:** 675 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs. The central finding is that these tariffs are primarily paid by American importers and consumers, not by foreign exporters. The analysis uses event studies of previous tariff shocks (e.g., on Brazil and India) to show that export prices from the affected countries did not decrease; instead, trade volumes collapsed. This indicates that foreign producers did not lower their prices to absorb the tariff costs. The article concludes that the financial burden of the tariffs falls on the U.S. economy, leading to higher prices for consumers and reduced trade activity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's findings, with commenters expressing broad consensus that tariffs function as a tax on domestic consumers. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Economic Consensus:** Many users pointed out that the article's conclusion is a fundamental concept of economics ("Economics 101"). They argued that tariffs are an input cost passed down through the supply chain, ultimately increasing prices for end consumers or reducing product availability if demand is price-sensitive. The burden is shared based on the price elasticity of supply and demand, but the consumer almost always bears a significant portion.

*   **Political and Geopolitical Motivations:** The discussion quickly turned to the political context. Some commenters questioned whether the negative economic outcome was an unintended consequence of a misunderstanding of trade, while others suggested it might be an "intended result" that benefits geopolitical rivals like Russia. The unpredictability of the tariff policy was also highlighted as a major factor damaging business confidence and investment in the U.S.

*   **Debate on Trade Imbalances:** A more nuanced point was raised regarding the justification for tariffs. One user argued that persistent global trade imbalances (e.g., with China and the EU) are not a sign of healthy "free trade" and that tariffs, while a crude tool, are an attempt to unilaterally correct these imbalances. This view was presented as a Keynesian perspective, though it was not widely defended in the thread.

*   **Legal and Institutional Concerns:** The discussion touched upon the legal basis for the tariffs, with users referencing a New York Times article about the Trump administration's potential response if the Supreme Court ruled against them. This highlighted concerns about the separation of powers and the potential for executive overreach.

*   **Skepticism and Source Credibility:** A minor theme involved questioning the source of the analysis (a German think tank), with one user suggesting Americans might be suspicious of foreign analysis. However, other commenters countered that domestic sources might be compromised by political pressure, and the best approach is to engage with the study's methodology rather than dismiss it based on its origin.

## [A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth](https://bitchat.free/)
**Score:** 573 | **Comments:** 313 | **ID:** 46675853

> **Article:** The article links to "Bitchat," a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth. The service is accessible via the URL bitchat.free and is presented as a tool for direct, off-grid communication without reliance on internet infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Bitchat is multifaceted, focusing on technical limitations, social context, and comparisons to existing tools. A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the utility and practicality of Bluetooth-only messaging. Users question the limited range of Bluetooth (typically under 400 meters), debating whether it is sufficient for real-world use cases like protests or festivals. While some argue it is viable in areas with poor coverage or during internet shutdowns, others point out that deferred message propagation—allowing messages to be stored and forwarded by intermediate nodes—is a missing feature essential for reliable off-grid communication.

The discussion also touches on the involvement of Jack Dorsey, a notable figure in the tech industry. Several commenters express skepticism or dislike toward his participation, while others speculate on the financial freedom that allows him to pursue such projects. This leads to a tangential debate about "fuck-you money" and the feasibility of living off-grid on modest savings.

Security and reliability are major concerns. Commenters frequently compare Bitchat to Briar, an established offline messaging app that is reportedly being used in Iran during current political unrest. Many users express a preference for Briar due to its security audits and established track record, while noting that Bitchat lacks an iOS app, significantly limiting its reach. Technical hurdles regarding background app execution on mobile operating systems, particularly iOS, are also highlighted as potential barriers to effective usage.

Finally, the conversation expands to include related technologies like Meshtastic and general file-transfer apps (e.g., LocalSend, QuickShare), with users expressing a desire for a robust, consumer-ready P2P network that is resistant to censorship and monitoring.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 466 | **Comments:** 245 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** Amazon announced it will end its inventory commingling program for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) sellers, effective March 31, 2026. Commingling allowed Amazon to fulfill orders for multiple sellers from a single pooled inventory, meaning a customer buying from a specific seller might receive a product from a different seller's stock. Ending this practice ensures that when a customer buys from a specific vendor, they will receive the exact item sourced from that vendor's inventory, rather than a potentially different or counterfeit item from another provider claiming to have the same SKU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted overwhelmingly positively to the announcement, viewing it as a long-overdue correction to a system that prioritized logistics efficiency over product authenticity and consumer trust. Many commenters shared personal anecdotes of receiving counterfeit or inferior goods—such as defective HDMI adapters and unusable toner cartridges—despite ordering from reputable sellers, attributing this directly to commingling. The consensus is that this change will restore accountability, as buyers will now be guaranteed the specific product they purchased from a specific vendor.

While some celebrated the move as a win for consumer protection, others expressed skepticism about the timing, questioning why it took Amazon over a decade to address an issue that has damaged its reputation for years. The cynical view suggested that external pressures, such as financial penalties from manufacturers or large buyers burned by counterfeit goods, likely forced Amazon's hand rather than a proactive desire to improve service.

The discussion also broadened to critique Amazon's market power and broader business practices. Some users noted they had already shifted away from Amazon due to declining service quality, often opting to browse on Amazon but purchase directly from manufacturer websites. A tangential but notable thread compared Amazon's commingling to the Kenyan coffee trade, where beans from various farmers are pooled and graded collectively; this system was criticized for disincentivizing quality and creating a "race to the bottom," paralleling the issues seen with Amazon's inventory management.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 434 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is the full text of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his nonviolent protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter is a defense of direct action against racial injustice. King argues that individuals have a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws, distinguishing between just and unjust laws based on moral and divine principles. He expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate," whom he identifies as a greater obstacle to freedom than overt segregationists due to their preference for order over justice and their insistence on delaying action. The letter is a powerful articulation of the philosophy behind the Civil Rights Movement, emphasizing the urgency of now and the need to create tension to force negotiation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" is multifaceted, with users reflecting on its timeless relevance, its philosophical underpinnings, and its application to contemporary politics.

A significant portion of the comments focus on the letter's core principles of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance. One user highlights King's nuanced argument that breaking an unjust law, when done openly and with a willingness to accept the penalty, is a form of "highest respect for law." This sparks a conversation about the distinction between legality and justice, with another user connecting it to the foundational ideas of civil disobedience. However, this principle is also contrasted with more modern, violent movements, with one commenter suggesting that King's nonviolent approach was only one part of a larger equation that included the looming threat of armed resistance from groups like the Black Panthers.

The most prominent theme in the discussion is King's critique of the "white moderate," which many commenters see as strikingly relevant today. Several users quote the passage where King laments those who are more devoted to "order" than to "justice" and who prefer the "absence of tension" to the "presence of justice." This is directly applied to current American politics, with one user arguing this describes the schism within the Democratic Party between "liberals" (the modern moderate) and "leftists." This political interpretation is further detailed with examples like the party's response to the murder of a woman by an ICE agent, where a call for reform (body cameras) is seen as a moderate response that fails to address systemic issues, in contrast to a more radical call for abolition.

Other comments touch on the letter's personal impact. Several users mention it was required reading in their education and that they revisit it annually, finding new meaning with each reading. The letter's emotional power is also noted, particularly the passage where King describes explaining segregation to his young daughter. A user also highlights a quote about the "appalling silence of the good people" and the need to repent for inaction, contrasting it with the more optimistic "arc of history" quote. The discussion also includes a brief, contentious thread attempting to apply King's principles of civil disobedience to the January 6th Capitol riot, which is quickly shut down by other users who point out the fundamental difference in nonviolence and context.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 330 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-weight large language model released by the Z.ai team. It is a 31B parameter model (a distilled version of the larger GLM-4.7) designed to offer high performance in a smaller, more accessible footprint, particularly for coding and reasoning tasks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the model's accessibility, performance relative to benchmarks, and the practicalities of running it locally or via API.

**Performance and Benchmarks**
Commenters are analyzing the model's technical specifications and benchmark claims. It is described as a 31B parameter model (potentially a Mixture-of-Experts architecture), which users compare to GPT-oss 20b and 120b. While some are skeptical of its benchmark scores—suggesting it lags behind proprietary models by roughly a year—others note that its coding performance on SWE-Bench appears competitive with models like o3 or GPT-5 mini, making it a strong contender for its size.

**Local Deployment and Accessibility**
A major theme is the feasibility of running the model on consumer hardware. Users are excited about the potential to run "GPT-5 mini level" AI on machines with 32GB of RAM. There is active sharing of resources for local deployment, specifically quantized versions (GGUF) via llama.cpp. One user provided a specific command for running a Q4_K_M quant on a GPU, noting that while the tooling is available, there may be initial bugs in the chat template.

**API and Cloud Provider Availability**
Users inquired about immediate cloud access. It was noted that providers like z.ai and Novita are offering the model, with others expected to follow. However, a user shared a negative experience using the model via Cerebras, citing strict rate limits and a pricing structure that charged full price for cached tokens, making it less practical and more expensive than alternatives like GPT-5.2-Codex for coding tasks.

**Use Cases and Limitations**
The model's size makes it a prime candidate for fine-tuning experiments and local use cases where larger models are too resource-intensive. However, some users caution that small-tier models (under 70B parameters) are often limited to simple tasks like translation or trivia and may struggle with complex reasoning or hallucinate more frequently than larger counterparts.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 284 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** The Cloudflare blog post details an incident where a change to their authoritative DNS servers caused widespread outages. The change involved reordering DNS records in responses, specifically placing A records before CNAME records, which broke several DNS clients. The root cause was ambiguous language in RFC 1034, which Cloudflare interpreted as allowing any order for records in the answer section. However, many clients, including the widely used glibc `getaddrinfo` function and certain Cisco switches, implicitly relied on the traditional order where CNAME records appear before A records. The post explains that while the RFCs didn't explicitly mandate this order, the de facto standard was strong enough that the change caused significant failures. Cloudflare has since reverted the change and proposed a new standard to clarify that CNAME records must precede other records in the answer section.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely centers on the nature of the failure and the lessons learned. Many commenters express surprise that such a fundamental change was deployed without comprehensive testing against major client implementations like glibc, which is ubiquitous on Linux. There is a strong consensus that Cloudflare's testing was insufficient, with several users noting that a robust test suite should have caught the issue before deployment.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the ambiguity of the RFC. While Cloudflare claimed the standard was unclear, many commenters argue that the language ("preface by one or more CNAME RRs") is actually quite clear and requires CNAMEs to come first. Some suggest Cloudflare misinterpreted the RFC, while others acknowledge there might be some ambiguity regarding CNAME chains but agree the general ordering is explicit.

The discussion also touches on broader software engineering principles. Hyrum's Law is frequently cited to explain how any observable behavior of an API can become a dependency for users, making changes risky. Postel's Law ("be liberal in what you accept, be conservative in what you send") is debated, with one user noting it's considered increasingly harmful in modern industry. The consensus is that while Cloudflare's interpretation of the RFC might have been technically plausible, the real-world impact of breaking widely deployed clients necessitates adhering to the de facto standard, which Cloudflare has now committed to doing.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 278 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the distinction between organic search results and advertisements. The change involves displaying ad results with a "Sponsored" tag that is less prominent than in previous iterations, potentially making it more difficult for users to differentiate between paid placements and genuine search results. This move is seen as an expansion of Apple's advertising business within its ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Apple's decision, framing it as a classic example of "enshittification"—the process by which a platform degrades its user experience to maximize revenue. Commenters express disappointment, viewing this as a departure from Apple's historical focus on user experience and a sign that corporate greed has taken precedence over product quality.

A central theme is the comparison to competitors, particularly Google's Play Store and Amazon's search results, which have long integrated ads into organic listings. Many users argue that this move erodes one of the key differentiators of the Apple ecosystem, which was previously marketed as a safer and more curated environment. This concern is compounded by existing frustrations with the App Store, specifically the prevalence of copycat apps and scams that impersonate legitimate software, a problem that more ambiguous ad placements could exacerbate.

There is also significant cynicism regarding the business rationale. Commenters suggest that this is an inevitable result of capitalism's demand for perpetual growth, noting that Amazon's advertising business is a massive profit center. Some speculate this is a strategic response to regulatory pressure in the EU, which may force Apple to allow alternative app stores, compelling them to monetize their own platform more aggressively before that happens.

Finally, the discussion touches on a perceived decline in Apple's innovation and leadership. Several comments compare the current situation to Microsoft's "Ballmer era," suggesting Apple is run by spreadsheet-focused executives rather than product visionaries. The debate extends to whether Apple has any real competition, with some arguing that Android's ecosystem has similar issues, while others maintain that Apple's move is a unique betrayal of its brand promise.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that Big Tech lobbying has successfully influenced the European Union to weaken and delay proposed digital regulations. It details how major US tech companies, through extensive lobbying and leveraging geopolitical tensions, have shaped legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the AI Act. The author contends that this has resulted in a "roll-back" of digital rights, favoring corporate interests over citizen privacy and competition, ultimately undermining the EU's regulatory sovereignty in favor of American corporate power.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is multifaceted, centering on the tension between EU regulation, US corporate dominance, and the current geopolitical climate. A dominant theme is the role of the Trump administration; several commenters argue that aggressive US foreign policy (such as threats against Greenland or NATO) is inadvertently forcing the EU to recognize its over-reliance on American tech and security infrastructure. There is a sense that this exposure of US unreliability might finally spur European digital sovereignty, though others are skeptical that political will exists to break away.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the feasibility and effectiveness of consumer action. While some users advocate for boycotting American products and provided resources for finding European alternatives, others expressed cynicism, citing the difficulty of sustaining such movements and the lack of public concern in Europe regarding digital rights. The conversation also touched on the regulatory burden, with some commenters arguing that the EU's complex laws stifle local innovation and drive companies away, while the article frames these regulations as necessary protections.

Finally, there is a strong undercurrent of political cynicism. Users debated the influence of lobbying on both the far-right and far-left within the EU parliament, with many expressing a loss of faith in democratic processes to counter corporate capture. The consensus among many was that despite the alarming nature of the article, average citizens are largely apathetic, and meaningful change is unlikely without significant geopolitical upheaval.

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 230 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article links to a NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) news post announcing a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm that occurred on January 19, 2026. This indicates a significant solar radiation event capable of causing power grid fluctuations and auroras visible at lower latitudes than usual. The post serves as an official alert regarding the intensity of the solar activity.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the visual spectacle of the event and the accessibility of the official alert, rather than widespread panic over infrastructure damage.

A major point of contention was the accessibility of the NOAA warning page. Several users criticized the agency for presenting the critical warning text as an image rather than selectable text, making it inaccessible to screen readers and visually impaired users. Commenters noted the irony of a government agency failing basic accessibility standards and speculated that the graphic was likely a simple PowerPoint slide.

The majority of the conversation, however, was celebratory and observational. Users across Europe and the United States reported visible auroras, with specific sightings confirmed in Berlin, Munich, and the Netherlands. There was a lively exchange about photography techniques, with users sharing tips on long exposure and HDR settings to capture the lights despite light pollution. A notable sub-thread involved users sharing links to live European webcams that had captured the solar flares and even passing Starlink satellites in real-time.

Regarding the severity of the event, the community compared the G4 rating to historical events like the Carrington Event (a G5), noting that while significant, this storm was not catastrophic. A user monitoring the PJM Interconnection (a major US grid operator) reported that while warnings were issued, no grid reconfiguration or alerts were triggered, suggesting the power infrastructure handled the disturbance without issue. While some users discussed emergency preparedness for potential future "Carrington-level" events, the general sentiment was one of fascination rather than alarm.

## [Wikipedia: WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46677106

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia WikiProject AI Cleanup, a collaborative effort to identify and remove AI-generated content from the encyclopedia. The project provides guidelines and resources for editors to spot text produced by large language models, which often exhibits specific stylistic markers (such as overly generic phrasing or specific formatting quirks) and frequently contains unsourced or fabricated information. The initiative aims to maintain Wikipedia's reliability and human-authored quality standards in the face of increasing AI-generated vandalism and low-effort contributions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the implications of AI on Wikipedia's integrity and utility. While there is broad consensus that unsourced, AI-generated "slop" degrades the encyclopedia, opinions diverge on the best response.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **Detection vs. Prevention:** Users noted that the project focuses on identifying stylistic markers of AI writing, but emphasized that the primary criterion for deletion remains violations of core Wikipedia policies, such as lack of reliable sources or neutrality. One user pointed out the irony that these detection guidelines could be used by AI labs to fine-tune models to evade detection.
*   **The Value of Human Curation:** A recurring sentiment is a preference for human-written content, even if it is flawed or obscure, over the generic tone often produced by AI. Some users expressed a desire for "pre-LLM" snapshots of Wikipedia, with suggestions ranging from using the Wayback Machine to downloading offline archives via Kiwix.
*   **AI as a Tool for Improvement:** Not all views were negative toward AI. Several commenters suggested using LLMs constructively, such as for detecting factual contradictions within articles or rephrasing poorly written text to improve clarity, rather than generating new content.
*   **Wikipedia's Broader Challenges:** The conversation expanded to include other grievances with Wikipedia's recent evolution, including UI changes and restrictive policies on "ongoing events" talk pages. This suggests a broader anxiety about the platform's direction and the dilution of its community-driven ethos.
*   **Practical Solutions:** A developer shared a personal project, PickiPedia, which uses an MCP server to flag AI contributions for human verification, highlighting a technical approach to the problem.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint analysis of social media research published in top journals found that nearly a third of studies have undisclosed ties to industry, such as prior funding or employment. The study claims that industry-tied research receives more attention and tends to focus less on platform-scale impacts, suggesting that industry influence is extensive, impactful, and often opaque. The authors recommend strengthening disclosure norms and policies to ensure research integrity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses widespread cynicism and lack of surprise at the findings, with many commenters viewing industry influence in research as a systemic, inevitable problem across various sectors like food, pharmaceuticals, and fossil fuels. A common theme is the erosion of trust in institutions, with some users expressing a desire to disconnect from society entirely. The conversation also touches on the broader ethical implications of corporate research, particularly social media companies' ability to conduct large-scale experiments without independent oversight, which some find alarming while others see as a necessary trade-off for innovation. There is a recurring point about the practical reality that industry often funds and conducts specialized research that academia cannot, creating a dependency that compromises independence. The discussion concludes with a meta-comment questioning the potential biases of the study itself, highlighting the pervasive skepticism.

## [Nvidia contacted Anna's Archive to access books](https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46677628

> **Article:** A new class-action lawsuit, expanded with internal NVIDIA documents, alleges that NVIDIA executives authorized the use of millions of pirated books from Anna's Archive to train its AI models. According to the authors suing NVIDIA, the company directly contacted the shadow library to secure high-speed access to the data, as standard web scraping was too slow to download the estimated 500 terabytes of books. NVIDIA has defended its actions by claiming the use constitutes "fair use," arguing that books are merely "statistical correlations" for its AI models.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of NVIDIA's alleged actions, focusing on the ethical and legal implications of a trillion-dollar company utilizing pirated content.

Commenters widely rejected NVIDIA's "fair use" defense, arguing that ingesting the entire corpus of published literature to train commercial LLMs far exceeds the scope of traditional fair use protections. Many viewed the defense as a cynical legal strategy, noting that copyright law is often skewed in favor of wealthy corporations who can afford prolonged litigation. There was a shared sentiment that while individual authors lack the resources to fight NVIDIA, massive entities like Disney might eventually challenge these practices.

The discussion also highlighted the hypocrisy of NVIDIA seeking "high-speed access" from a piracy site while simultaneously defending its actions legally. Users noted that NVIDIA's need for such vast amounts of data exposes the limitations of current AI development methods, contradicting industry narratives that synthetic data or new techniques will soon solve data scarcity. Several commenters also speculated on the broader ecosystem, questioning whether other tech giants like Amazon are already utilizing their proprietary access to Kindle books for similar training purposes.

## [Show HN: Pdfwithlove – PDF tools that run 100% locally (no uploads, no back end)](https://pdfwithlove.netlify.app)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46675231

> **Project:** The project is "Pdfwithlove," a web-based tool for PDF manipulation that emphasizes privacy by performing all processing 100% locally in the browser without uploading files to a backend. Built using web technologies, it aims to be a free alternative to services like iLovePDF. The developer is also expanding functionality to include image processing and is considering a Chrome extension or desktop app, potentially as a paid product ($2 for lifetime access).
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was mixed, with users questioning the necessity and execution of the tool. A recurring theme was the saturation of the market, with one user listing numerous recent "Show HN" posts for client-side PDF editors, suggesting the concept has become a "new 'hello world' app." While some praised the privacy-first approach, others pointed out that established solutions like PDF24 and Stirling PDF already exist, and that command-line tools like `pdftk` or `ffmpeg` (often assisted by LLMs) offer similar capabilities.

Technical concerns were prominent. One user criticized the app's offline capabilities, noting that the site hangs without an internet connection due to runtime asset loading, though the developer acknowledged this and plans to improve it. Another user tested the Word-to-PDF conversion and found it "completely useless," producing incorrect output with missing images, suggesting a lack of rigorous testing. The developer admitted to using LLMs to speed up development, which a commenter speculated contributed to the bugs and UI quirks.

Other discussions touched on branding, with one user feeling the name "Pdfwithlove" infringed on the "iLovePDF" trademark, though others disagreed. There was also a debate on the best delivery method: a web app allows users to verify network activity (transparency), while a downloadable executable is often perceived as a higher security risk. The developer received UI feedback regarding missing cursor pointers and outlined a roadmap that includes a PWA for better offline support and a paid Chrome extension.

## [Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550)
**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46678550

> **Question:** The user asks how AI coding tools are affecting the work of COBOL developers. The question implies a potential concern that the scarcity of public COBOL code might make AI less effective for this legacy language compared to more modern ones.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a split between practical, domain-specific experiences and broader philosophical debates about AI's role in programming.

**Practical Experiences with COBOL and AI:**
*   **Positive Use Cases:** Several developers reported success using AI, particularly for tedious tasks like constructing file layouts or acting as an advanced search tool for large documentation. One banking developer noted that fine-tuned models work well with their proprietary codebases, suggesting that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax is naturally suited for LLMs.
*   **Limitations and Challenges:** Others found general-purpose models noticeably worse at COBOL compared to languages like Python or JavaScript. A key challenge is the lack of public training data; most COBOL code is proprietary and runs on specific mainframe flavors, meaning public models have little exposure to it. Furthermore, the complexity and context of legacy systems often require a level of understanding that AI currently lacks.
*   **Legacy System Maintenance:** A developer maintaining a large ColdFusion app shared a similar experience: early LLMs were poor, but modern ones can write code that "just" needs review. They also successfully used AI to convert a legacy app to a more modern stack.

**Broader Themes and Opinions:**
*   **The "Vibe Coding" vs. "Vetted Code" Debate:** A recurring theme is the distinction between blindly trusting AI ("vibe coding") and using it as a productivity tool. Senior developers emphasized that they use AI extensively but review and understand every line of code before committing it. The consensus is that AI is a tool to be controlled, not an autonomous replacement.
*   **AI as a Force Multiplier, Not a Replacement:** Many commenters view AI as a tool that augments their skills rather than a threat to their jobs. The ability to describe requirements clearly and guide the LLM is seen as a crucial skill, likening the process to leading a junior developer.
*   **COBOL's Longevity:** Several comments reinforced the idea that COBOL (and Fortran) will persist for a long time due to the massive, critical codebases in finance and other industries. The cost and risk of replacing these systems are too high, ensuring a continued need for human experts.
*   **Comparison to Other Languages:** The limitations of AI are not unique to COBOL. Developers working with C, Zig, and Rust also reported that AI is best for snippets and research, not for generating complex, production-ready code without significant human oversight.

## [The Code-Only Agent](https://rijnard.com/blog/the-code-only-agent)
**Score:** 147 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46674416

> **Article:** The article "The Code-Only Agent" proposes a minimalist approach to AI agent design. Instead of equipping an agent with a multitude of specific, pre-defined tools (like `search_web`, `query_database`, etc.), the author advocates for providing it with a single, powerful tool: the ability to execute code (e.g., a `run_python` or `run_bash` function). The core idea is that by writing and executing code, the agent can create its own tools on the fly to solve any given problem. This approach is argued to be more flexible, powerful, and fundamental than managing a complex and often brittle ecosystem of external tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's premise but explores its practical implications, limitations, and alternative interpretations. Many commenters shared their own experiences building similar systems, with one user describing a pattern where an agent creates and refactors composable CLIs, effectively building a personalized toolkit over time. This was seen as an "emergent" and highly flexible way to compute.

However, a key counterpoint was raised regarding context management. While a code-only agent is powerful, it can struggle with loading and maintaining the necessary context for complex tasks. This is where more integrated tools, like those in Cursor or Claude Code, which proactively push relevant code and data into the agent's context, have an advantage. The discussion also touched on the trade-off between simplicity and reliability; a minimal toolset can make an agent more predictable, even if less "clever."

Other comments offered different perspectives: some debated the theoretical underpinnings of "Turing completeness" in this context, while others envisioned more radical implementations, like an agent operating directly on hardware binaries. A more grounded view was that standard shell tools (`bash`, `grep`) are themselves a form of robust, battle-tested code, making them an ideal and sufficient interface for an agent. The conversation concluded with a practical question of whether this code-only approach is truly more efficient than using existing, well-integrated tools for common tasks like database analysis.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports on a study confirming that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are being paid almost entirely by American consumers and businesses, not by foreign exporters as was promised. The study provides evidence that the costs of these tariffs are being passed through the supply chain to U.S. buyers, resulting in higher prices for imported goods and components.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the tariffs, with commenters expressing frustration that the economic burden falls on Americans. A central theme is the psychological and political dynamics driving support for the policy. Several users noted the irony of blue-collar workers celebrating the tariffs as a way to force purchases of more expensive American-made goods, arguing that this perspective ignores the broader economic damage, such as increased costs for business inputs and reduced consumer choice. There was a strong consensus that the tariffs function as a regressive tax, with one user providing specific federal budget data to illustrate that the revenue generated is a small fraction of the national deficit, suggesting the policy is primarily a transfer of wealth rather than a viable fiscal solution.

Commenters also debated the geopolitical consequences, with a pessimistic outlook on the long-term damage to U.S. credibility and influence. The discussion highlighted a fear that other nations are permanently shifting supply chains away from the U.S. and that the policy is accelerating the decline of American global standing. While one user proposed an alternative industrial policy involving subsidized exports to build manufacturing scale, the general sentiment was that the current approach is chaotic and counterproductive. The conversation concluded with a cynical view of the political landscape, suggesting that the Democratic party's best strategy is to allow the administration's policies to fail on their own merits, though others warned this would leave a difficult legacy to repair.

## [San Francisco coyote swims to Alcatraz](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/san-francisco-coyote-alcatraz-21302218.php)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46674433

> **Article:** A coyote was observed swimming from San Francisco to Alcatraz Island, a distance of approximately 1.5 miles. The article includes a video showing the coyote reaching the shore, appearing tired and shivering. Officials suspect the animal was swept away from the mainland by currents and managed to reach the island. The coyote has not been found on the island, leading to speculation that it is hiding to recover from the arduous swim.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is split between analyzing the coyote's journey and using the event to discuss broader ecological themes. Many commenters expressed amazement at the coyote's endurance, noting that a 1.5-mile swim is a significant feat, though others pointed out that animals like deer and raccoons are known to swim similar distances. Humorous references to the Road Runner and ACME products were prevalent, lightening the tone of the conversation.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the article's clarity. Several users found the reporting confusing, specifically regarding whether the coyote was "swept away" from the mainland (causing the swim) or swept away from the island (explaining why it hasn't been found). There was also a minor thread regarding the website's anti-bot verification measures, which one user found frustrating enough to abandon the page.

Finally, the conversation pivoted to ecological conservation, sparked by a comparison to New Zealand's unique wildlife. Users discussed how introduced predators threaten flightless birds on offshore islands, drawing parallels to the coyote's ability to reach isolated landmasses. The consensus was that such "heroic journeys" by invasive species can disrupt fragile ecosystems, making predator-free islands difficult to maintain despite human efforts.

## [Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/)
**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46683947

> **Article:** A TechCrunch article reports that Meta's Threads has surpassed X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile users, citing new data. The article highlights that a year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now. It notes that Threads benefits from a massive distribution funnel through Instagram, requiring an account for signup (though some regions allow phone number signup). The growth is attributed to Meta's integrated ecosystem and cross-promotion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is skeptical of the reported user parity and focuses on the quality of the platforms rather than just raw numbers. Key themes include:

*   **Data Skepticism:** Several users questioned the methodology and context of the data. One commenter pointed out that while X's daily active users have declined, the drop (from 150m to 125m) didn't seem drastic enough to justify the headline. Others noted that HN post volume still heavily favors X, suggesting it remains the hub for tech news despite Threads' growth.
*   **Platform Quality and User Experience:** Many commenters expressed dissatisfaction with X's current state, describing it as a "shadow of its former self" filled with bots, abandoned accounts, and repetitive content. Conversely, Threads was described as "moderately engaging" but lacking the unique, high-value content found on X. The discussion highlighted that X's algorithm is still effective at surfacing niche technical content, whereas Threads often feels like a stream of reposted Instagram content.
*   **The "Walled Garden" Critique:** A debate emerged regarding the nature of the platforms. While one user dismissed both as "walled gardens," another defended Threads for its ActivityPub integration (Fediverse compatibility), distinguishing it from X's closed ecosystem.
*   **External Factors:** Commenters attributed X's decline to alienating half the U.S. audience by becoming overtly right-leaning and the rise of short-form video platforms like TikTok, which they argued are superior for stimulating content compared to microblogging.
*   **Alternatives:** Several users mentioned migrating to alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, with some noting that Bluesky is finally gaining traction within the tech community.

## [Nonviolence](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/nonviolence)
**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46683410

> **Article:** The linked article from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute defines nonviolence as more than just the absence of violence. It outlines King's philosophy, which was influenced by Gandhi, as a principled and active way of life. The core tenets include a belief in the humanity of all people, a willingness to accept suffering without retaliation, and the goal of achieving reconciliation and a "Beloved Community." It distinguishes between nonviolence as a moral principle and as a pragmatic strategy for social change, emphasizing that it seeks to awaken a sense of moral shame in the opponent and win them over, rather than to coerce or defeat them.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the practical effectiveness and necessary context of nonviolent movements, often challenging the idealistic view presented in the article. A dominant theme is the "dual-track" or "good cop/bad cop" theory, where commenters argue that nonviolence is most effective when it coexists with, or is backed by, a credible threat of violence. This idea is repeatedly cited in the context of the American Civil Rights Movement (MLK alongside Malcolm X) and the Indian independence movement (Gandhi alongside more militant figures), suggesting that nonviolent groups become the "negotiable" alternative to violent factions, thereby shifting the baseline for compromise.

This leads to a debate on the causal link between nonviolence and success. While one commenter cites academic research showing that nonviolent movements are statistically more successful, others question this correlation, suggesting that movements with better odds of success might simply be more likely to choose nonviolence in the first place.

The discussion also explores the philosophical underpinnings of nonviolence. Some commenters argue that its effectiveness depends on the opponent having a conscience or caring about public perception, a condition they feel is not met by modern authoritarian regimes or purely economic conflicts. The concept of "agape" (selfless love) is brought up as the moral foundation for principled nonviolence, distinguishing it from a purely utilitarian tactic that might be abandoned once power is achieved. Finally, there is a cynical counterpoint that in contemporary society, nonviolent protests are often ignored or met with overwhelming state force, rendering them ineffective without the leverage of a credible threat.
