## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 695 | **Comments:** 696 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 US tariffs. It concludes that the costs of these tariffs are overwhelmingly borne by American importers and consumers, rather than foreign exporters. The analysis uses event studies and trade data to demonstrate that export prices from targeted countries (like Brazil and India in past instances) did not decrease significantly in response to tariffs; instead, trade volumes collapsed. The article frames the policy as counterproductive, effectively acting as a tax on domestic consumption and production, with the negative effects compounded by the unpredictability of trade policy which dampens business investment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's economic conclusions but diverges into political speculation, historical context, and semantic debates.

A central theme is the economic consensus that tariffs function as a consumption tax paid by domestic buyers. Several users expressed bewilderment that this basic economic principle is politically contested, attributing this to partisan media narratives. However, the discussion also explored nuances, noting that tax burdens can shift depending on market elasticity, though the prevailing view in the thread is that the US consumer bears the primary cost.

The conversation quickly pivoted to the political and legal ramifications of the tariffs. Users debated the constitutional authority of the executive branch to levy taxes, with references to ongoing Supreme Court litigation. There was significant speculation about the administration potentially ignoring or circumventing judicial rulings, drawing parallels to historical constitutional crises.

Economic ideology provided a rare point of intersection in the thread. One user argued that while the method (tariffs) is crude, the goal of addressing global trade imbalances resonates with both Keynesian and Mercantilist theories. This sparked a counter-debate on the nature of "free trade" and whether persistent trade deficits are inherently unsustainable, with some users defending the status quo and others citing the "exorbitant privilege" of the US dollar as a complicating factor.

Finally, the thread included meta-discussion regarding the source of the analysis. Some users expressed skepticism toward a German think tank's findings due to national bias, while others defended the institution's independence. There were also minor debates over terminology, specifically the use of "US Americans" versus "Americans."

## [A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth](https://bitchat.free/)
**Score:** 581 | **Comments:** 316 | **ID:** 46675853

> **Article:** The article links to "Bitchat," a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth. The service is presented as a way to communicate without relying on traditional internet infrastructure or central servers, functioning directly between nearby devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Bitchat is multifaceted, focusing on technical limitations, social context, and comparisons to existing tools. A recurring theme is skepticism regarding the utility of Bluetooth-only communication due to its limited range (typically under 400 meters). While some users identified use cases such as protests, crowded festivals with poor cell service, or general offline scenarios, others questioned its practicality for serious security needs.

The conversation frequently pivoted to comparisons with Briar, a more established offline messaging app. Several commenters expressed a preference for Briar, citing its longer track record and active use in high-risk environments like Iran. There was also concern over Bitchat's lack of "store-and-forward" capabilities—meaning messages cannot be cached and relayed by intermediate devices—limiting its effectiveness in real-world mesh networking scenarios.

Personal and financial critiques of the project's creator, Jack Dorsey, surfaced multiple times, with some users citing distrust of his involvement. However, the discussion also broadened into a philosophical debate about "fuck-you money," analyzing the net worth required to pursue passion projects like this indefinitely. Technical discussions touched on the challenges of P2P file transfer, the potential integration with Meshtastic to extend range, and the difficulties of maintaining background processes on mobile operating systems like iOS.

**Score:** 496 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 46676276

> **Article:** Radboud University in the Netherlands has selected the Fairphone as the standard smartphone for its employees. The university's announcement highlights the device's modularity and repairability as key factors in the decision, allowing for in-house maintenance and potentially longer device lifecycles. This move is positioned as a sustainable and practical choice for the institution.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practicality, sustainability, and limitations of Fairphone and the broader smartphone market. Commenters largely viewed the university's decision as a logical one, noting that the phone's modular design is well-suited for an institutional IT department to manage repairs and stock parts, potentially saving costs and hassle compared to traditional repair or replacement models.

However, skepticism was raised regarding Fairphone's real-world reliability and long-term viability. Several users shared anecdotes of disappointment with the devices, while others pointed out that buying second-hand or refurbished phones from major brands could be a more environmentally friendly option. The conversation also touched on the challenges of long-term support, with one user noting their friend's Fairphone model was discontinued after four years, forcing a new purchase.

The discussion expanded to include broader critiques and desires for the smartphone market. Many commenters expressed a desire for more repairable devices across all brands, suggesting that legislation should mandate easily replaceable batteries and screens, as well as unlockable bootloaders. Specific technical shortcomings of the Fairphone were also highlighted, such as the lack of a zoom camera and its use of USB 2.0, which some users found unacceptable for the price point. Finally, a niche but recurring theme was the lack of viable options for users seeking small phones or devices free from the Apple/Google ecosystem, with some suggesting alternative operating systems like /e/OS or Sailfish OS.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 474 | **Comments:** 249 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** Amazon will end its inventory commingling program for third-party sellers on March 31, 2026. Commingling allowed multiple sellers to pool identical items in Amazon's fulfillment centers, meaning a customer buying from a trusted seller could receive a product shipped directly from a less reputable third party. The end of this policy means that when a customer buys from a specific seller, they will receive inventory sourced specifically from that seller, ensuring greater authenticity and quality control.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the announcement, viewing it as a long-overdue correction to a system that prioritized logistics efficiency over consumer trust. The prevailing sentiment is that commingling facilitated the proliferation of counterfeit and low-quality goods, making it risky to purchase items like electronics or toner cartridges from Amazon. Many commenters expressed personal frustration with receiving counterfeit products despite ordering from reputable sellers, noting that this policy change might restore enough confidence to resume buying certain categories of goods on the platform.

Discussion regarding the motivation behind Amazon's decision was divided. Some users speculated that the move was reactive, likely driven by significant financial penalties from manufacturers or major buyers who were burned by counterfeit goods, rather than a proactive quality initiative. Others noted the timing—taking over a decade to address a well-known issue—was frustrating, with some stating the change is too little, too late to regain their trust.

The conversation also touched on broader themes of market power and consumer behavior. A few users suggested bypassing Amazon entirely by purchasing directly from manufacturers' websites. Additionally, the discussion expanded to include a comparison to the Kenyan coffee industry, where a centralized commingling system was cited as an example of how pooling fungible goods can disincentivize quality and harm individual producers, drawing a parallel to Amazon's previous inventory model.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 451 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his nonviolent protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter defends the strategy of direct action against racial injustice. King outlines the four basic steps of any nonviolent campaign: collection of facts, negotiation, self-purification, and direct action. He argues that nonviolent tension forces a community to confront the issue of segregation. King distinguishes between just and unjust laws, asserting that one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws openly and lovingly. He expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate," whom he identifies as a greater obstacle to freedom than the overt segregationist, due to their devotion to order over justice and their preference for a negative peace (absence of tension) over a positive peace (presence of justice). The letter is a powerful articulation of the philosophy and necessity of the Civil Rights Movement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail" is multifaceted, with users reflecting on its philosophical depth, historical context, and modern political relevance.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the letter's core philosophical arguments. Users highlight King's definition of civil disobedience—breaking unjust laws openly and accepting the penalty—as a timeless and powerful concept. This is contrasted with modern discourse, where such nuanced positions are seen as rare. The idea that time is neutral and can be used constructively or destructively is also frequently quoted, with users noting its contrast to the more optimistic "arc of history" quote. The letter's emotional weight is underscored by the passage describing the impact of segregation on children, which resonates deeply with many readers.

The historical context of King's nonviolence is debated. One commenter argues that the movement's success was not solely due to King's influence but was also underpinned by the real threat of violence from groups like the Black Panthers, suggesting that King's "carrot" was only effective because of the "stick" presented by others. This view challenges the "whitewashed" narrative of nonviolence often taught in schools.

The letter's principles are applied to contemporary American politics, particularly within the Democratic Party. King's critique of the "white moderate" is invoked to describe a perceived schism between "liberals" and "leftists." Some commenters argue that modern liberals, like the moderates King described, prioritize order and incrementalism over justice, defending the status quo (e.g., reforming ICE rather than abolishing it) and alienating the party's base. This political analysis is further extended to discussions on foreign policy and the interconnectedness of social justice issues.

Finally, the discussion touches on the letter's use in modern debates, with one user noting how its logic could be misapplied to defend the actions of January 6th rioters, a point quickly countered by others who emphasized the violence and forced entry that distinguished that event from the peaceful assembly King advocated. The overall sentiment is one of reverence for the text, with many users stating they reread it annually and find new insights with each reading.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 336 | **Comments:** 113 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-weight large language model released by z.ai (GLM). It is a 31B parameter model (likely a distilled or "Flash" variant of the larger GLM-4.7 model). The model is positioned as a smaller, more efficient alternative capable of running on consumer hardware while maintaining competitive performance on coding benchmarks like SWE-Bench Verified.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the model's accessibility, performance relative to other models, and the practicalities of running it locally.

Users are primarily interested in the model's size-to-performance ratio. At 31B parameters, it is viewed as a "Goldilocks" model—large enough to potentially perform complex tasks like coding, but small enough to run locally on hardware like a MacBook with 32GB of RAM or a consumer GPU (e.g., RTX 3090). There is particular excitement about its coding capabilities, with some commenters noting it appears competitive with GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini on benchmarks, though real-world utility remains to be seen.

A significant portion of the discussion is technical, centered on how to actually run the model. Users quickly shared resources for quantized versions (specifically 4-bit GGUF formats) compatible with llama.cpp, providing specific command-line instructions for setting up a local server with an OpenAI-compatible API.

There is also a comparison to other models in the same class, such as GPT-OSS 20b and Qwen3-coder. While some users found the benchmarks promising, others noted that the raw model weights are large (62GB), making quantization essential for local use. Additionally, there was a brief discussion about inference providers; while Cerebras was mentioned for its speed, a user cautioned that rate limits and pricing for cached tokens made it less practical for cost-effective usage compared to standard cloud providers.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 308 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** The article explains a DNS interoperability issue Cloudflare encountered when attempting to change the order of records in DNS responses. Specifically, Cloudflare wanted to reorder CNAME records to appear after the A record they pointed to, rather than before. While they believed the RFCs (specifically RFC 1034) did not explicitly mandate a specific order, they discovered that many DNS clients and servers—including critical infrastructure like the GNU C Library (glibc) and Cisco switches—relied on the traditional ordering. This reliance caused widespread failures, including device crashes and reboot loops. Cloudflare ultimately reverted the change and proposed a new standard to explicitly require CNAMEs to appear before A records to ensure future compatibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the implications of the incident, the clarity of DNS standards, and the responsibilities of infrastructure providers. A central theme was the debate over whether the original RFCs were truly ambiguous. Several commenters argued that the language in RFC 1034 was clear: CNAMEs should "preface" the answer, meaning they must come first. They viewed Cloudflare's claim of ambiguity as a misreading of the standard, suggesting the failure was due to a lack of rigorous testing rather than vague documentation.

However, others defended Cloudflare's interpretation, noting that while the RFC might imply an order, the lack of explicit enforcement led to a fragile ecosystem where broken implementations became the de facto standard. This led to a broader discussion about Postel's Law ("be liberal in what you accept"). While historically valued, some argued that strict adherence to it has become harmful in modern computing, as it allows broken implementations to persist and creates hidden dependencies on undefined behaviors.

The community also criticized the testing procedures at Cloudflare. Commenters expressed surprise that a change of this magnitude could pass testing without catching failures in glibc, which is a ubiquitous library on Linux systems. The consensus was that while Cloudflare's intent to standardize the behavior was correct, the rollout highlighted the difficulty of maintaining backward compatibility with decades-old internet infrastructure and the necessity of comprehensive testing against real-world clients.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 286 | **Comments:** 201 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** An article from 9to5Mac reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the line between organic search results and advertisements. The new layout presents paid placements more seamlessly integrated with standard results, making it less obvious to users which listings are ads. This move is seen as an expansion of Apple's advertising business, potentially increasing revenue by capitalizing on the high-intent traffic of its search function.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with widespread negativity and cynicism to the news, viewing it as another example of "enshittification" where a platform degrades its user experience to maximize profit. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Inevitability of Capitalism:** Many commenters argued that this was an unavoidable outcome for a public company like Apple, which must continually grow its revenue. It was noted that other major platforms, like Amazon, have already built massive businesses on paid search results.
*   **Erosion of Trust and Safety:** A major point of contention was the failure of the App Store's "walled garden" promise. Users pointed out that the store is already plagued by copycat apps and scams, and this new design would only exacerbate the problem by making malicious or low-quality apps more prominent.
*   **Apple's Decline:** Several users framed this as a sign of organizational decay at Apple, comparing it to Microsoft's "lost years" under Steve Ballmer. They argued that the company is now driven by spreadsheets and ad revenue rather than innovative product design, with some calling for a change in leadership.
*   **Cynicism and Lack of Alternatives:** While universally disliked, the sentiment was that users are trapped. The "walled prison" of the Apple ecosystem is too entrenched for most to leave, and the alternative (Android) is seen as having the same or worse issues. The change is perceived as Apple exploiting its captive audience.

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 284 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article links to a NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) news post announcing a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm event that occurred on January 19, 2026. The post details the solar radiation event and its potential impacts on Earth's magnetosphere. The link appears to be a hypothetical or future-dated scenario, as indicated by the 2026 date in the URL and the content of the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the accessibility of the government website and the visual spectacle of the event rather than immediate danger. A prominent critique was raised by user dschuessler, who pointed out that the warning page is an accessibility nightmare because the critical warning text is presented as an image without a text transcription for screen readers. Several users noted the irony that the page looked like a "PowerPoint slide."

While the article warned of a severe G4 storm, the community reaction was largely observational and enthusiastic rather than panicked. Users shared links to live webcams in Austria (foto-webcam.eu) where solar flares and auroras were visible, with others confirming sightings in Berlin, Germany, and as far south as Munich. There was some confusion regarding the timing of the storm's peak, with users debating whether it had already passed or was imminent.

Technical and practical questions were also addressed. Users discussed the necessity of long-exposure photography to capture the aurora, noting that the intensity of this event made it visible to the naked eye even in areas with light pollution. Regarding infrastructure impact, user Animids provided a log indicating that PJM (a major US grid operator) issued warnings but did not escalate to active grid reconfiguration, suggesting no immediate power grid failures occurred. Finally, the conversation touched on preparedness, with some users joking about "prepper" plans while others offered practical advice like stocking extra food and water.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that Big Tech lobbying has significantly influenced the European Union to weaken digital rights legislation. It details how major US tech companies have systematically lobbied against regulations like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the AI Act, framing them as burdensome to innovation and competitiveness. The author contends that this corporate pressure, often aligned with the interests of the US government, has led to a "roll-back" of protections for citizens, prioritizing corporate profits over privacy, competition, and democratic values.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with users expressing a mix of cynicism, geopolitical analysis, and calls to action. A dominant theme is profound disillusionment with both EU and US governance. Many commenters view the EU's actions as a betrayal of its citizens in favor of US corporate interests, with some suggesting that political systems are fundamentally corrupt and unresponsive to public dissent. The current US administration is frequently cited as a catalyst, with its aggressive foreign policy seen as inadvertently exposing the lack of trustworthiness in US tech and political power, thereby forcing Europe to reconsider its dependencies.

Geopolitical strategy is a major point of debate. Several users predict that the EU will be forced to adopt a "China approach" by developing its own sovereign tech ecosystem to ensure security and independence. However, this optimism is tempered by concerns about the EU's internal fragmentation due to the rise of far-right politics and the practical difficulties of fostering a competitive tech industry under heavy regulation, a point raised by those who argue that complex laws stifle European innovation.

A smaller but vocal thread focuses on direct consumer action, advocating for a boycott of American tech products and services. This idea is met with skepticism, with users pointing to the practical challenges of such a movement and its historical tendency to fizzle out. The discussion also touches on the role of lobbying, with a specific mention of Meta's meetings with far-right MEPs, sparking a debate about political bias and corruption. Ultimately, the conversation reflects a deep sense of powerlessness among citizens, a belief that systemic change is unlikely, and a growing recognition that the transatlantic alliance is fraying under political and economic pressure.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 249 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint analysis of high-profile social media research reveals that nearly a third of studies have undisclosed ties to industry, such as prior funding, collaboration, or employment. The study finds that industry-tied research receives significantly more attention from academics, policymakers, and the media, yet often shifts focus away from platform-scale impacts. The authors argue that these pervasive, opaque relationships compromise research independence and call for stronger disclosure norms and policies to ensure integrity and visibility for independent work.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the study's findings, with commenters expressing unsurprised cynicism about industry influence in research. Many draw parallels to other fields like pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels, and tobacco, framing it as a systemic issue where industry funding is often the only viable source for large-scale studies. A key theme is the erosion of trust, leading some to suggest disconnecting from social media or adding "friction" to its use.

The conversation also explores the root causes, noting that experts in a field often work within that industry, and that funding is scarce elsewhere. However, a significant counterpoint emerges regarding corporate research ethics: while some argue social media companies operate without the strict ethical oversight applied to academic or animal studies, others defend the private sector's efficiency, criticizing academic ethics committees as overly bureaucratic. The discussion concludes with a meta-comment questioning the potential biases of the study itself.

## [Wikipedia: WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup)
**Score:** 223 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46677106

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia page for "WikiProject AI Cleanup," a community initiative to identify and remove AI-generated content from the encyclopedia. The project aims to combat the influx of low-quality, unsourced, or factually incorrect text produced by large language models. It provides guidelines and resources for editors to detect AI writing, focusing on specific stylistic markers beyond common heuristics like em-dashes. The project emphasizes that content should only be removed if it violates Wikipedia's existing policies, such as lacking reliable sources or containing obvious AI artifacts (e.g., prompts like "Here is an article written in the style of Wikipedia").
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the practical and philosophical implications of AI on Wikipedia. The conversation is multifaceted, with several key themes emerging.

A central point of debate is the validity of the project's mission. While some users express concern about the "slop" degrading content quality and wish for a pre-LLM Wikipedia snapshot, others question the premise, arguing that the only metric that should matter is the presence of verifiable sources, regardless of the writing style. The counterargument is that AI-generated text is often low-effort, prone to hallucination, and lacks the quality control of human editing.

The discussion also explores the role of AI as a tool, not just a problem. Several commenters suggest using AI for constructive purposes, such as automatically detecting contradictions within or across articles, a task for which a recent research paper was cited. One user shared a personal project using an MCP server to flag AI contributions for human verification, demonstrating a hybrid approach.

Finally, the conversation touches on broader concerns about Wikipedia's relationship with the tech industry. Some commenters referenced Wikimedia's partnerships with AI companies for data access, with opinions split on whether this is a necessary compromise for sustainability or a problematic concession. There is also a sentiment that Wikipedia's own recent interface and policy changes have negatively impacted the user experience, independent of the AI issue.

## [Nvidia contacted Anna's Archive to access books](https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46677628

> **Article:** A class-action lawsuit filed by book authors alleges that Nvidia directly contacted Anna's Archive, a shadow library of pirated materials, to obtain high-speed access to millions of books for training its AI models. Internal documents cited in the lawsuit reportedly show that Nvidia executives authorized the use of this data, which amounted to approximately 500 terabytes. Nvidia has defended its actions by claiming "fair use," arguing that books are merely "statistical correlations" for its models. The article highlights the scale of the infringement, noting that Nvidia sought to bypass slower scraping methods to acquire the entire corpus of published literature to fuel its "NextLargeLLM" project.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely expresses outrage at Nvidia's actions, focusing on the ethical and legal implications of a trillion-dollar company utilizing pirated content. A central theme is the rejection of Nvidia's "fair use" defense; commenters argue that ingesting every book ever published goes far beyond the scope of fair use and is an existential threat to human authors. Users characterize the move as hypocritical, noting that while Nvidia sought "permission" for high-speed bandwidth, they did not seek permission from the copyright holders.

There is also significant skepticism regarding Nvidia's motives. Some users suggest that this was not for a consumer product but rather a "sales demonstrator" to sell more hardware by pushing the state of the art in AI. Others pointed out the irony that a company with Nvidia's resources still had to resort to pirated data, debunking claims that synthetic data alone is sufficient for training.

Finally, the discussion touched on the broader industry context. Commenters speculated that other tech giants, like Amazon, have likely already ingested their proprietary data (e.g., Kindle books) and questioned why Nvidia didn't simply purchase legal access. The consensus was that Nvidia prioritized cost-cutting and speed over legality, with many predicting that the company would face severe legal consequences.

## [Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46686640

> **Article:** Porsche announced that in 2025, it sold more "electrified" cars (battery-electric and plug-in hybrids) than pure combustion-engine vehicles in Europe. However, the company's global deliveries fell by 3% year-over-year, with a significant 26% drop in China, its largest market. The report highlights a shifting market dynamic where traditional luxury performance brands are facing stiff competition from Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD, NIO, and Xiaomi.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused less on the headline achievement and more on the broader context of Porsche's declining sales and the rising dominance of Chinese automotive manufacturing.

**Sales Performance and Market Shifts**
Commenters noted that while the European electrification milestone was interesting, the more telling data was the global sales decline and the sharp 26% drop in China. Several users argued that this signals a major shift where Chinese brands are not only winning the EV race but are positioning themselves to dominate the entire global automotive market, moving beyond niche EV segments to challenge legacy giants like Toyota.

**The Definition of "Electrified"**
A minor point of clarification arose regarding the term "electrified." Users pointed out that the figure includes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), not just pure battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). Some questioned whether this distinction matters given the rapid transition to full EVs, while others noted that Porsche has walked back some of its aggressive BEV goals for future models.

**Brand Identity and Product Critique**
A significant portion of the debate centered on Porsche's product strategy and brand dilution. Critics argued that Porsche's electric SUVs (Macan and Cayenne) are aesthetically unpleasing and technologically inferior to Chinese competitors, lacking features like advanced highway cruise control while losing the tactile feel of physical buttons and the "soul" of internal combustion engines. There was a sentiment that luxury cars are Veblen goods—where high price drives desirability—and that Porsche's brand equity is being tested as Chinese cars offer comparable luxury and technology at lower price points.

**Reliability and Future Outlook**
The discussion broadened to the health of the German auto industry as a whole. Several commenters expressed a loss of faith in German reliability, citing high maintenance costs and poor long-term quality. While some defended European engineering, the prevailing sentiment was that Japanese and emerging Chinese vehicles offer better value and reliability. The consensus was that German automakers are in a precarious position, struggling to adapt to the software-defined, electric future dominated by Chinese manufacturing.

## [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46682518

> **Article:** The article "Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)" provides a hands-on evaluation of Apple's anti-glare nano-texture display coating, available on high-end Macs and iPads. The author compares it to traditional glossy screens, noting that while the nano-texture successfully eliminates reflections and reduces eye strain in bright environments, it comes with trade-offs. These include a slight reduction in contrast and black levels, a "softer" image that may not be ideal for color-critical work, and a mandatory, specific cleaning process using only the included cloth (or a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for stubborn smudges) to avoid damaging the delicate surface. The author concludes that the feature is a worthwhile upgrade for users frequently working outdoors or in brightly lit offices, but potentially less necessary for those in controlled lighting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's findings but adds practical user experiences and clarifies technical details. A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the maintenance and cost of the nano-texture. Users humorously and critically noted that the specialized cleaning cloth is easily lost, with a replacement costing $19 from Apple. There was a debate on cleaning methods, with users sharing tips on using specific 70% isopropyl alcohol solutions, while others cautioned that alcohol can damage the oleophobic coatings on standard glossy screens.

Technically, commenters clarified that Apple does not manufacture the panels themselves but patents the nano-texture process, which differs from traditional matte screens. A key point of contention was the article's visual evidence; one commenter criticized the side-by-side photos for not properly controlling for brightness or showing a direct glossy screen comparison, making it difficult to judge the true impact on contrast. Another user confirmed the trade-off: the nano-texture "smears" reflections for comfort, but at the cost of the deep blacks found on glossy displays.

Finally, users shared practical advice and alternatives. Some confirmed their satisfaction with the nano-texture on iPad Pros, noting fingerprints were not a major issue. Others mentioned using DIY sunshields as a cheaper, effective way to combat glare on any laptop. The general consensus was that the nano-texture is a specialized feature with clear benefits for specific use cases, but it requires careful handling and comes at a premium.

> **Question:** The user asks "Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?" seeking insights from developers working with the legacy language COBOL on the impact of AI coding tools on their daily tasks and job security.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion presents a divided but nuanced view on AI's role in the COBOL ecosystem. A key positive argument is that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax aligns well with how Large Language Models (LLMs) process text, making it surprisingly suitable for AI assistance. One developer in banking noted that fine-tuned models are effective for their codebase, while another mentioned using AI to convert legacy apps to modern languages with success.

However, skepticism remains regarding the practical application and safety of AI in this domain. Several users pointed out that most COBOL codebases are proprietary, closed systems that lack the public training data necessary for general models to become proficient. There is also a strong sentiment against "vibe-coding" in critical financial systems, with developers emphasizing the need to thoroughly vet every line of AI-generated code.

Broader themes emerged about the nature of working with AI. One commenter argued that developers who find AI unhelpful often fail to architect the problem and prompt the LLM effectively, treating it as a magic wand rather than a tool requiring guidance. The conversation also touched on the staying power of COBOL and Fortran due to their massive, critical installed codebases, and a philosophical debate ensued comparing the deterministic nature of compilers to the probabilistic nature of LLMs.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports on a study confirming that U.S. consumers and businesses are bearing the cost of recent tariffs, rather than foreign exporters. The study indicates that the financial burden is being passed through supply chains, resulting in higher prices for imported goods and manufacturing inputs. This contradicts the political narrative that tariffs are paid by other countries, highlighting the economic reality of protectionist trade policies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the tariffs, with commenters expressing frustration that the economic burden falls on Americans. The consensus is that tariffs function as a regressive tax on consumers and domestic industries, raising costs for manufacturers who rely on imported materials.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Economic Reality vs. Political Narrative:** Users express disbelief that the public still believes tariffs are paid by exporting nations. They argue that the cost is inevitably passed to consumers through higher prices, citing the study as confirmation of basic economic principles.
*   **Impact on Domestic Industry:** Several commenters noted that tariffs on raw materials and inputs hurt American manufacturing competitiveness. One user shared an anecdote about a contractor who views higher prices as a justification to buy American tools, though others countered that this logic ignores the increased cost of doing business and the lack of wage growth to offset inflation.
*   **Political Motivation and Fiscal Policy:** The discussion shifted to the fiscal role of tariffs, with users characterizing them as a regressive revenue source to offset tax cuts for the wealthy and fund military spending. There was skepticism about the administration's strategic goals, with some describing the policy as chaotic rather than a calculated industrial strategy.
*   **Geopolitical Consequences:** Commenters worried about the long-term damage to U.S. credibility and the acceleration of a "New World Order" where the rest of the world moves away from U.S. trade dependence. There was a sense of resignation regarding the inability to stop the policy, with some suggesting that political opposition might strategically allow the economic fallout to worsen to secure future elections, though others warned this would cause irreversible damage to U.S. influence.

## [Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46683947

> **Article:** An article from TechCrunch reports that Meta's Threads has surpassed X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile users, citing new data. The article highlights that while X's daily active users have declined, Threads has seen steady growth, now reaching parity or slightly exceeding X in this metric. It also notes that Threads benefits from its integration with Instagram, which provides a massive user funnel for sign-ups and cross-promotion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's claim, focusing on the quality and context of the user numbers rather than the raw figures. A key point of contention is the article's assertion that X's US daily active users have halved since the acquisition; commenters argue the provided graph shows a much smaller decline (from ~150m to ~125m worldwide), suggesting the article may be misleading. The nature of the platforms is also debated: Threads is criticized as just another "walled garden" from Meta, though others point to its ActivityPub integration as a counterpoint. X is described as having a large number of silent observers and bots, with many users feeling its active community has shrunk. Several commenters express a preference for alternatives like Bluesky or Mastodon, viewing the current situation as a choice between two undesirable corporate-controlled platforms. The discussion also touches on broader trends, such as TikTok's dominance and the political polarization of X, as potential reasons for the decline in microblogging's popularity.

## [Nonviolence](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/nonviolence)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46683410

> **Article:** The linked article from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute defines nonviolence as a principled philosophy and a pragmatic strategy for social change. It distinguishes between nonviolence as a way of life (rooted in love and courage) and as a method of political action. The article outlines key characteristics of nonviolent campaigns, such as winning the sympathy of third parties, exposing the opponent's use of force, and maintaining a disciplined commitment to non-harm even in the face of violence. It emphasizes that nonviolence is not passive but an active, demanding form of resistance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the practical effectiveness and necessary conditions for nonviolent movements, often contrasting the idealistic philosophy with historical and strategic realities. A dominant theme is the "dual-track" theory, where nonviolence is seen as effective only when backed by a credible threat of violence or a more radical faction. Commenters argue that this dynamic creates leverage in negotiations, framing nonviolence as the "good cop" to a "bad cop" alternative, which shifts the baseline for what is considered an acceptable compromise.

This leads to a debate on the historical record. While some point to studies suggesting nonviolent movements have a higher success rate and are more likely to lead to stable democracies, others question this correlation, suggesting that movements with poor prospects are more likely to turn to violence (survivorship bias). The discussion also highlights the limitations of nonviolence, particularly against ideologically driven or economically motivated oppressors who may be immune to moral appeals. The role of figures like Malcolm X and the Black Panthers is cited as a crucial, often underrated, component of the Civil Rights Movement's success, providing the necessary pressure to make King's nonviolent strategy viable. Finally, the conversation touches on the philosophical underpinnings of nonviolence, such as the concept of "agape" (selfless love), suggesting that without this deeper moral framework, nonviolence risks becoming a purely utilitarian tactic that is abandoned once power is achieved.
