## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 719 | **Comments:** 722 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs. It concludes that the costs of these tariffs are overwhelmingly borne by American importers and consumers, rather than foreign exporters. The analysis supports this with empirical evidence, citing event studies of tariff shocks on Brazil and India where export prices did not decline, but trade volumes instead collapsed. This indicates that foreign producers did not lower their prices to absorb the tariff costs, leaving U.S. businesses and consumers to pay the higher prices. The article frames the policy as detrimental to the U.S. economy, effectively an "own goal."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's economic conclusions, treating them as a basic principle of economics. A central theme is the consensus that tariffs function as a tax on domestic consumers, with many commenters expressing bewilderment that this is not common knowledge. Several users point to anecdotal evidence that many Americans believe foreign countries pay the tariffs, attributing this to political messaging and media influence.

The conversation branches into several distinct areas:
*   **Economic Principles:** Users debate the nuances of tax incidence, with some arguing that while consumers bear the ultimate cost, the burden can be distributed unevenly depending on market dynamics. There is also a discussion on mercantilism, with one commenter arguing that the tariffs, while a crude tool, are a response to legitimate global trade imbalances, while others see the policy as purely destructive to business confidence and investment.
*   **Political and Legal Ramifications:** The discussion touches on the political context, with speculation about the Supreme Court's potential role in ruling on the legality of the tariffs and the administration's response. Commenters also reference the unpredictability of the policy as a key factor discouraging domestic investment.
*   **Skepticism and Source Credibility:** A minority of comments express skepticism toward the German-based think tank, suggesting a potential bias. However, other users counter this by questioning the trustworthiness of U.S.-based institutions in the current political climate and urging a focus on the study's data rather than its origin.
*   **Data and Evidence:** Some commenters engage with the data, referencing China's Producer Price Index to argue that Chinese export prices have remained stable, further supporting the article's claim that U.S. consumers are absorbing the tariff costs.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 488 | **Comments:** 251 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** An external article (via a Twitter link) reports that Amazon will end its inventory commingling program as of March 31, 2026. Under commingling, Amazon pooled identical items from different sellers in its fulfillment centers, meaning a customer buying from a specific seller might receive a product shipped from a different seller's inventory. The end of this practice means that when a customer buys from a specific vendor, they will receive the actual item sourced from that vendor, improving traceability and reducing the risk of receiving counterfeit or substandard goods.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted overwhelmingly positively to the news, viewing the end of commingling as a necessary step to restore trust and combat counterfeits. The consensus is that commingling allowed bad actors to dilute the marketplace with fake or inferior goods, making it impossible for consumers to guarantee they were receiving the product from the seller they chose.

Commenters debated the reasons behind Amazon's decision. While some believe Amazon finally acknowledged that the logistics advantages of commingling were outweighed by the damage to its reputation, others speculated that financial pressure—such as lawsuits from manufacturers or large buyers—was the primary driver. There was significant frustration that the policy lasted as long as it did, with users sharing personal anecdotes of receiving counterfeit electronics (like HDMI adapters) and printer toner. Many noted that this issue had degraded their trust in Amazon to the point where they now prefer buying directly from manufacturer websites.

A tangent in the discussion compared Amazon's system to the Kenyan coffee industry, where beans from different farmers are commingled and graded collectively. While some argued this system incentivizes quality through ratings, others noted it prevents farmers from building individual reputations and receiving fair pay, drawing a parallel to Amazon's "race to the bottom" dynamic.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 463 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his nonviolent protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter defends the strategy of direct action against racial injustice. King outlines the four basic steps of any nonviolent campaign: collection of facts, negotiation, self-purification, and direct action. He argues that nonviolent tension is necessary to force a community to confront its segregationist laws and practices. King distinguishes between just and unjust laws, asserting that one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws openly and lovingly, while accepting the penalty. He expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate," whom he identifies as a greater obstacle to freedom than the overt segregationist, due to their devotion to order over justice and their preference for a negative peace (absence of tension) over a positive peace (presence of justice). The letter is a powerful articulation of the philosophy of civil disobedience and a critique of complacency in the face of oppression.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" is multifaceted, with users reflecting on its personal impact, its philosophical underpinnings, and its application to contemporary politics.

Many commenters express deep personal reverence for the text, with several noting they reread it annually (particularly on MLK Day) and find new insights each time. It is described as a "masterclass in influence" and a foundational text that left a "life-long impression," especially for those who read it in high school. The letter is praised for its timeless quality and its ability to provide a moral framework for questioning authority.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on King's distinction between just and unjust laws, and his concept of civil disobedience. One user highlights the "unexpected" nature of King's argument that breaking an unjust law, while accepting the penalty, is an expression of the "highest respect for law." This is connected to Henry David Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience" and the founding principles of the United States. The conversation also touches on the practical application of this philosophy, with one user questioning when a law that is just on its face becomes unjust in its application.

The letter's critique of the "white moderate" is a central and highly relevant theme. Several commenters draw direct parallels between King's description of the moderate who prioritizes "order" over "justice" and current political dynamics. This is explicitly linked to an internal schism within the Democratic Party between "liberals" and "leftists," where moderates are seen as defending the status quo and being more critical of progressive activists than of their political opponents. Specific examples, such as the murder of Renee Good and the legislative response from figures like Cory Booker, are used to illustrate this modern-day "moderate" inertia. One user counters this perspective by suggesting that such ideas repeatedly fail in elections and may not have the popular support their advocates claim.

The discussion also includes historical context and counter-narratives. One commenter argues that the popular focus on King's nonviolence is a "white washed" narrative that omits the concurrent and necessary threat of violence from groups like the Black Panthers, suggesting King's "carrot" of nonviolence was only effective because of the "rod" of potential militancy. Another user attempts to apply King's logic to the January 6th Capitol riot, which is quickly refuted by others who point out the event's use of force and its location, distinguishing it from the peaceful assembly King advocated.

Finally, the conversation touches on related concepts from King's broader work, such as forgiveness and the cyclical nature of violence, with users quoting his sermons on loving one's enemies and the idea that "hate cannot drive out hate."

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 429 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article links to a NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) news post announcing a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm event on January 19, 2026. The post details the arrival of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and the resulting geomagnetic storm conditions, which can cause voltage irregularities in power grids and affect satellite operations. The event is classified as severe on the NOAA geomagnetic storm scale, which ranges from G1 (Minor) to G5 (Extreme).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of real-time observations of the event's effects, technical critiques, and practical advice. A primary theme is the visual spectacle of the aurora, with users from the central US, Berlin, and the Netherlands reporting sightings. Several commenters shared links to European webcams that captured stunning images of the solar flare's impact on the sky, including visible Starlink satellite trails.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the accessibility of the official NOAA warning page. Multiple users criticized the agency for presenting the entire warning text as an image, making it inaccessible to screen readers and visually impaired users. Commenters described the practice as an "accessibility nightmare" and noted the irony of a government website failing in this regard.

Technical and safety concerns were also raised. One user provided a link to the PJM Interconnection (a major US grid operator) dashboard, noting that while a warning was issued, no grid actions were necessary. Another thread discussed preparedness for a more extreme "Carrington-level" event, with users suggesting basic plans like stocking extra food and water. The overall tone, however, was more one of awe and curiosity rather than alarm, with many users clarifying that a G4 event is primarily a visual phenomenon for the general public and not a cause for widespread panic.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 379 | **Comments:** 296 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the distinction between organic search results and advertisements. The change involves displaying app listings with a "Sponsored" tag that is visually integrated into the result's metadata, making it less obvious that the placement is paid for. This move is seen as an expansion of Apple's advertising business, potentially increasing revenue but raising concerns about user experience and transparency.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly critical, with users expressing disappointment and cynicism about Apple's direction. The dominant theme is the concept of "enshittification," where users feel the company is prioritizing profit over user experience and the integrity of its ecosystem. Commenters argue that this is an inevitable result of capitalism and the pressure for constant growth, noting that Amazon and Google have already built massive revenue streams from similar ad placements.

Many participants connected this design change to a broader, pre-existing problem with the App Store: the prevalence of scam apps, impersonators, and copycats that confuse users and erode trust. Several commenters felt this new ad integration would only exacerbate that issue, making it harder to distinguish legitimate apps from paid placements. There was also a sense of resignation, with some arguing that users are locked into the Apple ecosystem and have no viable alternative, while others dismissed the potential revenue impact as insignificant for a company of Apple's size. The conversation concluded with a general consensus that this represents a decline in Apple's design philosophy and a shift toward a more aggressive, less user-friendly monetization strategy.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 364 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** The article discusses a recent incident where Cloudflare's DNS resolver began returning CNAME records after A records in response to queries, a change that broke several widely-used DNS clients. The root cause was ambiguity in the original RFC 1034, which did not explicitly mandate the order of CNAME records relative to A records in DNS responses. While Cloudflare interpreted the standard as allowing any order, common implementations like glibc's `getaddrinfo` and Cisco switch firmware relied on the traditional ordering (CNAMEs first, followed by the final A record). The change caused issues such as spontaneous reboots in affected devices. Cloudflare has since reverted the change and proposed a new standard to explicitly require CNAMEs to appear before other records to ensure compatibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the broader implications of the incident, with commenters debating the roles of standards, testing, and backward compatibility. Many expressed surprise that Cloudflare had not tested their change against common DNS clients like glibc, which is ubiquitous on Linux systems. The ambiguity in the RFC was a key point of contention: some argued the language was clear (CNAMEs should precede A records), while others felt Cloudflare's interpretation was reasonable but ultimately impractical given real-world dependencies. The incident was framed as a classic example of Hyrum's Law—where unintended behaviors become dependencies—and a failure to adhere to Postel's Law (be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send). Commenters also discussed the IETF process, suggesting that RFCs should be updated with clarifications rather than replaced, to avoid confusion. The consensus was that Cloudflare made the right call by reverting the change and standardizing the de facto ordering, prioritizing compatibility over strict adherence to an ambiguous standard.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 351 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-weight large language model from Z.ai. It is a 31B parameter Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, likely a distilled version of the larger GLM-4.7. The model is positioned as a smaller, more efficient alternative to its parent model, designed to offer high performance at a lower computational cost.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the model's practical utility, performance relative to other models, and ease of local deployment. A key point of interest is its size: at 31B parameters, it's considered a "perfect size" for running fine-tuning experiments and local inference on consumer hardware (e.g., a MacBook with 32GB RAM or a PC with a 32GB GPU). Users are actively exploring how to run it locally, with several comments providing specific instructions and links to quantized GGUF versions available on Hugging Face for use with llama.cpp.

There is significant debate about its real-world performance. While benchmarks suggest it's competitive with models like GPT-4o mini or o3 on coding tasks (SWE-Bench), some users are skeptical, noting it's much larger in file size (62GB vs 11GB for GPT-OSS 20B) and questioning if the benchmark gains translate to practical use. Early adopters are testing it for coding tasks, with some finding it a viable local alternative to cloud-based models like Codex, which can be slow or expensive. The discussion also touches on the availability of the model through cloud providers like Novita and OpenRouter, though it's noted that widespread availability may take time. Overall, the community views this as a solid incremental improvement, making high-performance AI more accessible for local and cost-sensitive applications.

## [Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html)
**Score:** 298 | **Comments:** 352 | **ID:** 46686640

> **Article:** Porsche announced that in 2025, it sold more "electrified" vehicles (battery-electric and plug-in hybrids) in Europe than pure internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. However, the article also highlights a challenging year for the brand, with global deliveries down 10% year-over-year and a significant 26% drop in the crucial Chinese market. The company is navigating a difficult transition, balancing its electrification goals with market realities and strategic shifts, such as postponing the all-electric K1 model in favor of ICE and PHEV options.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the broader implications of Porsche's sales data, focusing on three main themes: the rise of Chinese automotive manufacturers, the evolving identity and challenges of Porsche, and the changing nature of the car market.

A dominant theme was the interpretation of Porsche's declining sales in China as a bellwether for a major industry shift. Commenters argued that this isn't just about EV adoption but signals the rise of China as a global "automotive superpower." With brands like BYD, NIO, and Xiaomi gaining ground, users suggested Chinese manufacturers are not just competing in the EV niche but are poised to challenge established giants like Toyota for the entire global car market, leveraging a perceived cost and technology advantage.

The second theme was a critique of Porsche's current strategy and brand identity. Several commenters expressed concern that Porsche's electric vehicles, particularly the Macan and Cayenne, are technologically behind Chinese competitors and lack the "soul" of their iconic gas-powered sports cars. There was a sense that the brand is losing its luster as EVs become more like "appliances," diminishing the prestige of the Porsche badge. This skepticism was amplified by news of Porsche's financial losses and its strategic pivot away from a full-EV focus, which some saw as a sign of significant trouble.

Finally, the discussion touched on the broader market dynamics. While some noted that including plug-in hybrids in the "electrified" figure inflates the headline, others saw the trend as inevitable given the price and performance of EVs in the luxury segment. The conversation also highlighted the uncertainty surrounding long-term reliability for new Chinese brands versus the established (but also criticized) reliability of German cars, suggesting a complex future for consumer choice in the automotive landscape.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint analysis of high-profile social media research reveals that nearly half of the studies have disclosable industry ties (funding, collaboration, or employment), yet the majority of these connections go unreported in published papers. The study found that industry-tied research tends to focus less on platform-scale impacts and receives significantly more attention from academics, policymakers, and the media. The authors argue that this extensive, opaque industry influence necessitates stricter disclosure norms and policies to protect research integrity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely treats the findings as an unsurprising inevitability, drawing parallels to established conflicts of interest in the food, pharmaceutical, and fossil fuel industries. A central theme is the practical difficulty of funding independent research; commenters note that specialized expertise and necessary data are often locked within the industry itself, creating a dependency that makes impartiality difficult.

Reactions to the implications of the study diverge into two distinct camps regarding research oversight. One group expresses alarm that social media companies operate without the strict ethical oversight applied to academic research, comparing their unregulated "experiments" on populations to unethical animal testing. Conversely, a counter-argument views academic ethics committees as overly bureaucratic and "neurotic," suggesting that the private sector offers a more efficient research environment.

The conversation also touches on the psychological impact of such revelations, with some users expressing a desire to disconnect from the digital ecosystem entirely. Practical advice was offered to mitigate this, suggesting users add "friction" to their social media habits—such as deleting apps and manually typing URLs—to encourage intentional usage rather than passive scrolling. The discussion concludes with a meta-critical question regarding the potential biases of the study itself.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 165 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that Big Tech lobbying has successfully weakened EU digital regulations, resulting in a "roll-back of digital rights." It details how major US tech companies have influenced key legislation, including the Digital Services Act (DSA), Digital Markets Act (DMA), AI Act, and the Data Act, through targeted lobbying efforts. The piece contends that this influence has led to loopholes, diluted protections, and a regulatory environment that favors corporate interests over citizen privacy and digital sovereignty.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a multifaceted debate centered on EU sovereignty, US influence, and the practicality of resistance. A dominant theme is the critique of the EU Commission's perceived subservience to US corporate and political interests, with many commenters expressing disillusionment and cynicism about the effectiveness of democratic processes. This sentiment is amplified by the current geopolitical climate, particularly the Trump administration's policies, which some see as exposing the true nature of this relationship.

The conversation splits into two main camps regarding solutions. One faction advocates for a consumer-led boycott of American tech products, promoting European alternatives, though others are skeptical about the feasibility and sustainability of such movements, citing past failures and the deep entanglement of US services in the European economy. The other camp discusses the potential for the EU to develop its own sovereign tech ecosystem, a necessity driven by the perceived unreliability of the US as a partner.

Political dynamics within the EU are also a key point of discussion. Commenters debate the role of far-right MEPs and their meetings with Meta, questioning the objectivity of the criticism and the broader issue of political corruption. There is a general sense of pessimism regarding public engagement, with several users noting that digital rights are not a priority for the average European citizen, and that protests would likely be ineffective. The discussion concludes with a reflection on the broader economic context, linking the erosion of digital rights to rising inequality and the power of billionaire wealth.

## [Nova Launcher added Facebook and Google Ads tracking](https://lemdro.id/post/lemdro.id/35049920)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46686655

> **Article:** The article reports that Nova Launcher, a popular third-party launcher for Android, has added tracking and advertising SDKs in recent updates. This change follows the launcher's acquisition by a new company. The update (version 8.2.4) introduced Facebook Ads and Google AdMob SDKs, alongside existing analytics and crash reporting tools like Branch, Bugsnag, and Google Firebase Analytics.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is largely one of disappointment and a search for alternatives, though some users are considering workarounds. A key theme is the immediate need for replacement launchers, with users asking for and suggesting alternatives like Smart Launcher and open-source options available on F-Droid, such as Lawnchair. 

Many users are discussing technical mitigations to continue using older, pre-tracking versions of Nova, such as blocking network access for the app or using privacy-focused operating systems like GrapheneOS. There is a notable debate on whether older versions pose security risks if they are no longer updated. Some users express frustration with the performance impact of the new tracking, while others lament that no alternative has yet matched Nova's feature set and polish.

## [Wikipedia: WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46677106

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia page for "WikiProject AI Cleanup," a community-driven initiative to identify and remove AI-generated content from the encyclopedia. The project aims to maintain Wikipedia's quality and reliability by cataloging specific traits common in AI-generated text (such as certain stylistic tics or generic phrasing) and establishing guidelines for its removal, particularly when it is unsourced or factually incorrect. The project's page also links to a more detailed resource, "Wikipedia:Signs of AI Writing," which provides in-depth heuristics for identifying AI-generated text beyond common assumptions like the overuse of em-dashes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the implications of AI on Wikipedia's integrity and future. A central theme is the tension between Wikipedia's reliance on human-curated content and the growing influence of tech companies, both as sources of AI-generated "slop" and as partners providing funding or data access. While some commenters express concern that AI is degrading content quality, others point out that the AI Cleanup project is a recent development (started in late 2023), suggesting the problem is still emerging.

Several distinct viewpoints emerged. One group advocated for using AI as a tool for quality control rather than just content generation, citing a paper on using LLMs to find contradictions within Wikipedia. A practical suggestion was to build a system that checks new edits against a knowledge graph in real-time to flag inconsistencies. Another perspective was a desire for a "pre-LLM" snapshot of Wikipedia, with users suggesting methods like browsing older revisions or using offline archives like Kiwix to avoid what one commenter called "slop."

The debate also touched on the core principles of Wikipedia. Some argued that the only metric that should matter is the presence of a valid source, regardless of how the text was written. However, others countered that AI-generated text is often low-effort, prone to hallucination, and lacks the quality control that a human editor provides, making it unsuitable for a knowledge repository. Finally, a few comments branched off to discuss broader frustrations with recent Wikipedia interface changes and editing policies, indicating a general sentiment of dissatisfaction with the platform's recent evolution.

## [The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button](https://paulmakeswebsites.com/writing/shadcn-radio-button/)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46688971

> **Article:** The article "The Overcomplexity of the Shadcn Radio Button" critiques the implementation of a radio button component in the popular UI library Shadcn. The author argues that a simple form element requires an excessive amount of code (over 200 lines) and numerous file imports. This complexity arises because Shadcn is built on top of Radix UI, a headless component library that handles accessibility and state management, resulting in a heavy abstraction for a seemingly simple UI element. The author suggests that for many use cases, a simpler, more direct implementation using native HTML and CSS would be more efficient and maintainable.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News reveals a significant divide in the web development community regarding modern UI libraries and component complexity. The central debate contrasts the perceived over-engineering of libraries like Shadcn with the practical needs of building robust, accessible, and consistent user interfaces.

A primary theme is the justification for this complexity. Several commenters defend the approach, explaining that libraries like Radix UI (which Shadcn wraps) handle critical but non-trivial requirements such as cross-browser styling consistency, keyboard navigation, and accessibility (ARIA attributes). They argue that these features, while invisible in the final product, are difficult to implement correctly from scratch and justify the abstraction.

Conversely, a strong counter-argument posits that this complexity is unnecessary bloat. Critics point to modern CSS features like `appearance: none` and pseudo-elements (`::before`) that can style native radio buttons effectively, arguing that the trade-off of adding JavaScript dependencies and build-step complexity is not worth it for minor visual gains. This camp often attributes the trend to "Shiny Object Syndrome," where developers, particularly juniors, adopt trendy tools without questioning their necessity.

The conversation also touches on broader industry trends. Some commenters lament the general state of the JavaScript ecosystem, viewing this complexity as a symptom of a culture that prioritizes new frameworks over stable, long-term solutions. The choice of Shadcn itself was questioned, with some speculating it contains AI-generated code, while others highlighted its key feature: code ownership, which allows developers to modify the component, unlike traditional libraries where code is hidden in `node_modules`. Ultimately, the discussion reflects a tension between the desire for simplicity and the practical demands of building complex, production-ready web applications.

**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 43 | **ID:** 46686273

> **Article:** The article links to Reticulum, an open-source, secure, and anonymous mesh networking stack designed as an alternative to traditional TCP/IP. It enables communication over diverse physical layers, including LoRa, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and serial connections, allowing for resilient, decentralized networks. The project has recently reached version 1.0.0 and includes applications like MeshChat and Sideband (for Android) to facilitate user interaction, such as sending photos and voice chat over these mesh links.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant interest, largely viewing Reticulum as a technically robust and ideologically driven project. The discussion highlighted several key themes:

*   **Technical Capabilities and Comparison:** Users clarified that Reticulum is a full network stack, making it more versatile than chat-focused alternatives like Meshtastic. It supports a wide range of interfaces (LoRa, TCP/UDP, I2P, serial) and can route packets across diverse link types seamlessly. A key feature is its identity-based routing using cryptographic key pairs, which provides anonymity and removes the need for traditional IP addresses or DNS.

*   **Adoption and Project Health:** A major point of concern was the project's sustainability. While technically impressive, it is primarily a one-person effort. Commenters noted that the maintainer has recently stepped back from public interaction and community support, which could hinder wider adoption. The commit history was also cited as being opaque, making it difficult for others to track changes.

*   **Ideology and Licensing:** The project's license includes a clause prohibiting its use in the creation of AI/ML datasets. This sparked debate, with some questioning its enforceability given the code is hosted on GitHub (which has its own terms of service). Others noted this restriction aligns with the developer's strong ideological manifesto, the "Zen of Reticulum," which emphasizes human-centric technology and opposes AI.

*   **Practical Use and Accessibility:** Participants discussed the barrier to entry, noting that the primary implementation requires Python 3.8+. However, they also pointed out that it can run on various platforms, including 32-bit x86, and can be adapted to work over unconventional transport layers like SSH tunnels or standard I/O pipes.

## [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46682518

> **Article:** The article provides a detailed, hands-on review of Apple's Nano Texture glass, a matte-like anti-glare coating available on high-end displays like the Pro Display XDR and iPad Pro. The author contrasts it with traditional glossy screens, evaluating its performance in various lighting conditions. The review highlights that while the Nano Texture significantly reduces reflections and improves usability in bright environments, it comes with trade-offs: it can slightly reduce contrast and sharpness compared to glossy glass. The author also notes the unique, slightly textured feel of the screen and the necessity of the included polishing cloth for proper maintenance, as the surface is more delicate than standard glass. The overall conclusion is that for users frequently working in variable or bright lighting, the anti-glare benefits outweigh the minor compromises in visual fidelity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's findings but adds practical user experiences and clarifies technical points. A central theme is the trade-off between reflection handling and contrast; several users confirm that while the Nano Texture wash out blacks slightly compared to glossy screens, the dramatic reduction in distracting reflections makes it far more comfortable for prolonged work in typical office or outdoor settings. The conversation also heavily focuses on maintenance and the specialized cleaning cloth. Users humorously and critically discuss the $19 replacement cost for the cloth, with some sharing unofficial cleaning methods using isopropyl alcohol, though others caution that alcohol can damage oleophobic coatings on other devices.

Technical curiosity is evident, with users questioning whether Apple manufactures the panels themselves (consensus is no, they likely source from suppliers like Samsung) and seeking more details on the manufacturing process. Practical comparisons emerge, with one user describing a DIY magnetic sunshield as a cheaper alternative to achieve similar anti-glare results. Finally, there is a minor critique of the article's methodology, with a commenter suggesting that photo comparisons should have controlled for brightness and included more high-contrast imagery to better demonstrate the display's capabilities.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** A Wall Street Journal article reports on a study confirming that U.S. tariffs imposed since 2018 have been almost entirely passed on to American consumers and businesses, rather than being absorbed by foreign exporters. The study indicates that the costs of these tariffs are reflected in higher prices for imported goods, with no significant evidence of foreign manufacturers lowering their prices to compensate. The findings challenge the political narrative that tariffs are paid by other countries, highlighting instead that they function as a tax on domestic economic activity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the tariffs, with commenters treating the study's findings as an obvious economic reality rather than a revelation. The conversation quickly pivots from the economic data to political and cultural analysis.

Key themes include:
*   **Economic Impact:** Users universally agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers and businesses. Several commenters note that the tariffs specifically target manufacturing inputs, which raises production costs for U.S. industries and ultimately increases prices for end-users.
*   **Political Psychology:** A significant portion of the discussion analyzes the cognitive dissonance supporting the tariffs. One user shared an anecdote about a contractor who views the increased cost of imported tools as a positive incentive to buy more expensive American-made alternatives, framing the financial loss as a patriotic win. Commenters attribute this perspective to effective conservative media messaging and "mental gymnastics," noting that the same economic conditions under a different administration would likely be condemned.
*   **Fiscal Policy:** Users debated the utility of tariff revenue. While some view tariffs as a regressive tax to offset tax cuts for the wealthy, others point out that the revenue collected is insufficient to cover the federal deficit or debt servicing, suggesting the tariffs are economically damaging without solving fiscal issues.
*   **Geopolitical Consequences:** There is a strong sentiment that the tariffs are accelerating the decline of U.S. global influence. Commenters argue that allies are diversifying supply chains away from the U.S. and that the "America First" policy is self-sabotage, permanently damaging economic credibility and ceding influence to rivals like China.

## [There's a hidden Android setting that spots fake cell towers](https://www.howtogeek.com/theres-a-hidden-android-setting-that-spots-fake-cell-towers/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46683833

> **Article:** The article highlights a hidden Android setting, "Mobile Network Security," that alerts users when their phone connects to a potentially insecure cell tower, such as a fake tower (IMSI-catcher). This feature is designed to detect older, unencrypted protocols like 2G, which are vulnerable to interception. However, the article clarifies that this specific security suite is currently exclusive to newer hardware, primarily the Pixel 10 series, due to requirements for the modem to communicate specific network information to the OS.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of skepticism, practical concerns, and platform comparisons. A central theme is the limited utility of the feature; many users question what action they can take after receiving an alert, with some cynically noting that reporting fake towers to the police is futile. The conversation quickly pivots to the more effective solution of disabling 2G connections entirely. However, users point out a significant hurdle: many modern Android phones, even flagships, lack a simple toggle to disable 2G, forcing them to remain vulnerable via automatic network fallback.

There is also notable frustration regarding hardware and platform limitations. Commenters note that this advanced security feature is not available on most current Android devices, being restricted to specific Pixel models. For iOS users, the only way to disable 2G is by enabling "Lockdown Mode," which introduces other restrictive changes to the OS. Ultimately, the discussion underscores a broader tension between the technical possibility of user protection and the practical reality of fragmented hardware support, carrier restrictions, and the inescapable nature of pervasive surveillance.

## [Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46678550

> **Question:** The user asks how AI coding tools are affecting the work of COBOL developers, specifically inquiring about the impact on their daily tasks and workflows.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a split between optimism regarding AI's utility and skepticism about its reliability, alongside a broader debate on the nature of programming with LLMs.

Several developers reported positive experiences, noting that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax aligns well with how LLMs process text. One banking professional mentioned using fine-tuned models for their specific codebase, while others found AI useful for tedious tasks like constructing file layouts or acting as an advanced search tool for documentation. There was also mention of AI successfully assisting in migrating legacy code (such as ColdFusion) to more modern languages.

However, other users expressed doubts about AI's effectiveness with COBOL. Some argued that proprietary COBOL flavors used by financial institutions lack sufficient training data for public models. Others noted that AI struggles with the complex system specifics and large context windows required for mainframe environments, asserting that it is better suited for snippets rather than full production code. A general sentiment emerged that while AI can generate code, human oversight remains essential; one commenter emphasized that "vibecoding" (writing code without understanding it) is distinct from using AI as a tool while maintaining full architectural control.

The conversation broadened into a philosophical debate on AI's role in software development. Some viewed the shift as inevitable, comparing it to the historical transition from Assembly to high-level languages. Conversely, others argued that LLMs are fundamentally different from deterministic compilers and cannot yet master the nuance required for critical systems. The discussion concluded with a meta-commentary on the Dunning-Kruger effect, suggesting that those least familiar with software development often overestimate AI's current capabilities.

## [Nanolang: A tiny experimental language designed to be targeted by coding LLMs](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/nanolang)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46684958

> **Article:** The article introduces Nanolang, a tiny experimental programming language created by Jordan Hubbard (NVIDIA/FreeBSD) specifically designed to be targeted by coding LLMs. The language features a Lisp-like syntax with S-expressions and requires every function to have tests that run at compile time. The project includes documentation files like MEMORY.md that explain the language's design, with the explicit goal of making it easier for LLMs to generate and work with code in this language.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals mixed reactions to Nanolang's premise, with several key themes emerging. Many commenters questioned the fundamental value of creating a new language for LLMs instead of using existing languages like Python or Lua with constraints. The skepticism centered on whether teaching an LLM a custom language would be more effective than leveraging its training on widely-used languages.

The compile-time testing requirement sparked significant debate. While some saw it as innovative, others worried it would create excessive noise in real-world code, potentially requiring "shadow" functions just to satisfy the compiler. The discussion referenced Pyret, an existing teaching language with similar testing requirements, suggesting this wasn't entirely novel.

A notable technical insight came from the observation that LLM performance scales with training data availability, implying that established languages might actually work better despite their complexity. This challenged the core assumption that a simpler, custom language would be easier for LLMs to handle.

Practical experimentation by commenter simonw provided concrete evidence: while a one-shot generation attempt failed, giving the LLM access to the documentation and compiler feedback loop enabled successful code generation. This highlighted the importance of context and iterative interaction rather than just language simplicity.

The discussion also touched on broader themes like error handling philosophy (with some praising Nanolang's approach compared to Rust's verbosity), and whether the language should be more Lisp-like given its S-expression foundation. Several commenters expressed enthusiasm for the creative freedom that AI-assisted language development enables, while others remained cautious about the practical utility.
