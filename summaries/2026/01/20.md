## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 701 | **Comments:** 701 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs. The central finding is that the costs of these tariffs are overwhelmingly borne by American importers and consumers, not by foreign exporters. The analysis uses event studies of previous tariff shocks (e.g., on Brazil and India) to demonstrate that export prices from the affected countries did not decrease; instead, trade volumes collapsed. This supports the economic consensus that tariffs function as a tax on domestic consumers, leading to higher prices and reduced economic activity rather than being paid by the target nation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the tariffs and largely in agreement with the article's economic conclusions, though it branches into several related themes.

A primary theme is the fundamental economic principle that tariffs are a tax on domestic consumers. Commenters express disbelief that this is a point of contention, framing it as "Economics 101." They argue that tariffs are simply an added input cost that is passed on to the end consumer, leading to either higher prices or the unavailability of goods. The discussion notes that even if domestic substitutes exist, they often rely on imported inputs, and businesses are hesitant to invest in new domestic capacity due to the unpredictable nature of trade policy.

The conversation also delves into the political and geopolitical dimensions. Some commenters suggest the tariffs' true, unstated goal might be to reduce trade volumes, possibly to the benefit of geopolitical rivals like Russia. There is significant discussion about the legal authority for imposing tariffs, with one user pointing to a New York Times article (linked in a comment) suggesting the administration is preparing to replace the tariffs if the Supreme Court rules them an unconstitutional tax. This highlights a perceived constitutional crisis over the separation of powers.

Finally, commenters address the broader context and motivations. One user argues that the tariffs are a crude tool to address persistent global trade imbalances, a goal with which even Keynesian economists might agree, though they would likely disagree with the method. Another thread questions the credibility of the German think tank producing the analysis, with a counter-argument that think tanks in tariff-targeted countries have a strong incentive to produce objective research. The discussion concludes with a brief, data-driven debate on whether Chinese producer prices have fallen in response to the tariffs, with one user providing data to suggest they have remained relatively flat, reinforcing the idea that U.S. consumers are bearing the cost.

## [A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth](https://bitchat.free/)
**Score:** 587 | **Comments:** 316 | **ID:** 46675853

> **Article:** The article links to "Bitchat," a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application that operates over Bluetooth. The service aims to provide a way to communicate without relying on the internet or central servers, using Bluetooth to connect nearby devices directly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Bitchat is multifaceted, focusing on technical limitations, social implications, and comparisons to existing tools. A significant portion of the conversation is driven by the involvement of Jack Dorsey, the former Twitter CEO, who is a contributor to the project. Several users expressed skepticism or dislike toward his involvement, while others noted the privilege of having the "fuck-you money" and time to pursue such niche interests, leading to a broader debate on financial independence and lifestyle choices.

Technically, the community raised several concerns and use cases:
*   **Range and Utility:** Users questioned the practicality of Bluetooth-only messaging given its limited range (typically under 400 meters). While some argued it is useful for scenarios without internet access—such as festivals, protests, or areas with poor coverage—others felt the range was too restrictive for serious use cases like journalism in high-risk environments.
*   **Feature Gaps:** A critical technical limitation identified was the lack of "deferred message propagation." Unlike mesh networks that store and forward messages to future contacts, Bitchat currently relies on the recipient being in range when a message is sent. Commenters argued this feature is "table stakes" for real-world usability, particularly for connecting disjointed groups of users over time.
*   **Platform and Background Restrictions:** The absence of an iOS app was noted as a major drawback. Furthermore, users speculated that aggressive background app management by mobile operating systems (especially iOS) could hinder the reliability of such always-on Bluetooth services.

Comparisons to other tools were frequent. Briar was repeatedly recommended as a more mature, security-audited alternative that functions similarly but offers more features. There was also discussion about integrating Bitchat with Meshtastic to extend its range via LoRa, and a general desire for better P2P file transfer solutions that work without a central Wi-Fi router.

Finally, the conversation touched on the real-world relevance of such technology, particularly in the context of internet shutdowns in places like Iran. While Bitchat was mentioned, commenters noted that Briar is already being actively used in those scenarios, emphasizing the importance of security audits for high-risk users.

## [Radboud University selects Fairphone as standard smartphone for employees](https://www.ru.nl/en/staff/news/radboud-university-selects-fairphone-as-standard-smartphone-for-employees)
**Score:** 502 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 46676276

> **Article:** Radboud University in the Netherlands has selected the Fairphone as the standard smartphone for its employees. The announcement highlights the device's modularity and repairability as key factors in the decision, allowing the university's IT department to perform in-house maintenance and repairs using easily available spare parts, rather than relying on external repair services or full device replacements.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practicality, sustainability, and limitations of the Fairphone and the broader market for ethical electronics. Commenters largely viewed the university's decision as a logical and cost-effective strategy for a large organization with an in-house IT department, noting that stocking spare parts for on-site repair is often more efficient than managing external repair logistics.

However, skepticism was raised regarding Fairphone's long-term viability and reliability. Some users shared anecdotes of being disappointed by the devices' performance and questioned their sustainability compared to buying second-hand phones. A key concern was the risk of model discontinuation, which could render the modular parts ecosystem useless over time, negating the primary benefit of repairability.

The conversation expanded to a broader critique of the smartphone market. Many commenters expressed a desire for more modular, repairable, and open devices, drawing parallels to companies like Framework in the laptop space. There was a strong call for legislation to mandate user-replaceable batteries and screens across all manufacturers. Several users also voiced frustration with the lack of a truly "de-googled" or open-source alternative that doesn't compromise on features like camera quality, USB 3.0 speeds, or compact form factors, highlighting a significant gap in the current market that Fairphone only partially fills.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 480 | **Comments:** 251 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** Amazon is ending its inventory commingling program for third-party sellers, effective March 31, 2026. The program previously allowed different sellers listing the same SKU to pool their inventory in Amazon's fulfillment centers. When a customer placed an order, Amazon would ship a random item from the pool rather than specifically from the seller the customer purchased from. Ending this practice means that when a customer buys from a specific seller, they will receive the actual inventory from that specific seller, ensuring authenticity and traceability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the announcement, viewing it as a long-overdue correction to a system that prioritized logistics efficiency over consumer protection. The prevailing sentiment is that commingling facilitated the proliferation of counterfeit goods and defrauded customers, who often unknowingly received inferior products from random third-party suppliers rather than the trusted vendor they intended to buy from.

Commenters expressed frustration that Amazon allowed this system to persist for years, citing personal experiences with counterfeit electronics (such as HDMI adapters) and consumables (like printer toner). Many noted that this policy eroded trust in the platform to the point where they stopped buying specific categories of goods from Amazon entirely.

Discussion regarding the motivation behind the change centered on two main theories:
1.  **Financial Liability:** A cynical perspective suggests Amazon is likely facing significant financial penalties from manufacturers or large buyers who were burned by counterfeit goods, forcing the change.
2.  **Reputation Management:** Others believe Amazon finally acknowledged that the reputational damage from counterfeiting outweighed the logistical savings.

There was also a debate on the legality and ethics of the practice, with some users expressing shock that the commingling model was legal in the first place. While the change is viewed positively for rebuilding trust, some commenters remain skeptical, noting that Amazon's market power and past service declines have permanently driven them to shop directly from manufacturer websites.

A tangential discussion emerged comparing Amazon's commingling to the Kenyan coffee trade, where beans from different farmers are pooled and graded collectively. While the analogy highlighted the "race to the bottom" dynamic of fungible commodities, it also sparked a nuanced debate about whether such collective systems can incentivize quality or inevitably lead to extraction and decline.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 455 | **Comments:** 151 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is the full text of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his civil rights protests as "unwise and untimely," the letter is a defense of nonviolent direct action against racial injustice. King argues that individuals have a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws, doing so openly and with a willingness to accept the penalty to awaken the community's conscience. He distinguishes between just and unjust laws, defines just action as being in line with the moral law of God, and expresses profound disappointment with the "white moderate" who values order over justice and perpetuates oppression through lukewarm acceptance and a misguided sense of timing.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the enduring relevance and multifaceted interpretations of King's letter. A primary theme is the letter's power as a masterclass in effecting change through moral influence and civil disobedience rather than authority or violence. Many commenters express deep personal gratitude for having read the letter, often in a high school setting, noting its lifelong impact on their understanding of justice and authority.

A significant point of debate revolves around the context of nonviolence. One commenter argues that the historical focus on King's nonviolent approach is a "white-washed" narrative that omits the concurrent and necessary threat of armed resistance from groups like the Black Panthers, suggesting King's "carrot" of nonviolence was only effective because of the "stick" of potential violence. This perspective is challenged by others who maintain that King's philosophy was a deliberate and powerful strategy in its own right.

The letter's philosophical arguments are also explored. Commenters highlight King's distinction between just and unjust laws and his definition of civil disobedience—breaking an unjust law "openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty"—as a classic and foundational principle. His critique of the "white moderate" is frequently cited as being especially relevant today, with some commenters applying it to modern political dynamics, such as the perceived schism within the Democratic Party between "liberals" (the new moderates) and "leftists." This application sparks further debate about the effectiveness of different political strategies and whether certain ideas fail at the ballot box because they are genuinely unpopular.

Finally, the discussion touches on related concepts from King's work, such as his views on forgiveness and the cyclical nature of violence, with commenters sharing quotes and personal reflections on how these ideas continue to shape their thinking.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 344 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-source large language model released by z.ai (GLM). It is a 31B parameter model (with a 355B total parameter MoE architecture, but only 31B active), designed to be a smaller, more efficient "Flash" variant of the larger GLM-4.7 model. The model aims to provide high performance, particularly in coding tasks, at a size that is feasible for local hosting and fine-tuning.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the model's specifications, performance relative to competitors, and practicalities of local deployment. Key themes include:

*   **Performance and Benchmarks:** Users are analyzing the model's capabilities, noting that while it is a 31B model, its reported SWE-Bench Verified score (59.7) is competitive with larger models like GPT-oss 120b (62.7) and o3/GPT-5 mini. However, some commenters caution that benchmarks can be misleading ("benchmaxxed") and that real-world performance, particularly regarding hallucinations, needs to be verified.
*   **Size and Hosting:** The 31B active parameter size is highlighted as a "sweet spot" for users wanting to run models locally on hardware like a MacBook or a 32GB GPU. It is significantly smaller than the full GLM-4.7 (355B parameters), making it more accessible for self-hosting than its larger counterpart.
*   **Local Deployment and Tooling:** There is immediate interest in running the model locally. Users discuss using `llama.cpp` with 4-bit quantization (specifically Q4_K_M GGUF files). A working command for `llama-server` was shared, along with links to quantized versions on Hugging Face (e.g., by unsloth and ngxson).
*   **Cost and API Access:** Users inquired about cloud vendors offering the model. OpenRouter and z.ai were mentioned as initial providers. A comparison was made regarding the cost-effectiveness of using GLM-4.7-Flash via API versus models like GPT-5.2-Codex, though a user noted that Cerebras (a potential inference provider for GLM) had rate limits and caching issues that made it less practical despite high theoretical speeds.
*   **Comparison to Other Models:** The model is frequently compared to GPT-4o mini, GPT-oss 20b, and Qwen3-coder. While some view it as a solid incremental improvement, others are skeptical of its quality compared to established proprietary models like Codex or Opus, especially for complex tasks.

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 338 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article links to a NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) news update announcing a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm that occurred on January 19, 2026. The post links directly to the official government alert regarding this significant solar radiation event.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mix of practical observations, technical critiques, and casual commentary. Key themes include:

*   **Visual Observations and Aurora Viewing:** Many users reported visible auroras, with sightings confirmed in Germany (Berlin, Munich), the Netherlands, and parts of the central United States. Several users shared links to live webcams in Austria that captured the event, noting the visibility of the lights and even passing Starlink satellites. A sub-thread discussed photography techniques, noting that while long exposures enhance the view, the intensity of this storm made the aurora visible to the naked eye even through light pollution.

*   **Accessibility and Website Critique:** A significant portion of the discussion criticized the NOAA website for poor accessibility. Users pointed out that the critical warning text was presented as an image rather than text, making it inaccessible to screen readers. One commenter noted the image appeared to be a PowerPoint slide, highlighting a lack of professional web standards for a government agency.

*   **Technical Context and Severity:** Users debated the severity of the event. While the official alert was G4 (Severe), commenters noted that the geomagnetic index (Kp) reached 8.67, which is high but still below the "Carrington Event" level of 9. Others discussed the frequency of such storms, noting they occur periodically during the solar cycle.

*   **Infrastructure and Safety Concerns:** A few users touched on potential risks. One commenter noted that the PJM Interconnection (a major US grid operator) issued warnings but did not need to take grid action, indicating no immediate power infrastructure failures. Another user sparked a discussion on emergency preparedness for extreme solar events, though the general sentiment remained lighthearted, with suggestions to simply keep extra food and water on hand.

*   **General Sentiment:** The overall tone was one of curiosity and appreciation for the natural phenomenon rather than alarm. The "blaring klaxons" of the official warning were contrasted with the community's focus on the "cool night lights," with many expressing excitement at the rarity and visibility of the display.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 327 | **Comments:** 113 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** The Cloudflare blog post details an incident where a seemingly minor change to their authoritative DNS servers caused widespread outages. The change involved reordering the Resource Records (RRs) in DNS responses, specifically placing A records before CNAME records, which is technically permissible under the ambiguous wording of RFC 1034. However, this broke several widely deployed DNS clients and infrastructure devices, including the GNU C Library (glibc) and Cisco switches, which expected CNAME records to always precede A records in the answer section. The post explains that while Cloudflare believed their original implementation was standards-compliant, the de facto standard required a specific order. They have since reverted the change and are proposing a new RFC draft to clarify the ordering requirements for future interoperability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely centers on the causes of the incident and the broader implications for software development and standards. A primary theme is the debate over whether the RFC 1034 specification was genuinely ambiguous. Several commenters argue that the language ("preface by one or more CNAME RRs") is clear and that Cloudflare misinterpreted it, suggesting the issue was an oversight rather than a standards problem. Others, however, acknowledge that the ambiguity existed and that practical implementation realities must take precedence.

There is significant criticism of Cloudflare's testing procedures. Commenters express surprise that a company of Cloudflare's scale would deploy such a change without comprehensive tests covering common clients like glibc, which is ubiquitous in the Linux ecosystem. This is framed as a failure to test against real-world dependencies, not just the written standard.

The discussion also touches on broader software engineering principles. Hyrum's Law is cited to explain how any observable system behavior becomes an implicit dependency for users, while the validity of Postel's Law ("be liberal in what you accept") is debated, with some arguing it's outdated and harmful. The consensus among commenters is that Cloudflare made the right decision to revert the change and align with the de facto standard, prioritizing stability over a strict but ambiguous interpretation of the RFC.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 204 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that makes advertisements less distinguishable from organic search results. The change involves blurring the background of ad banners and removing the blue "Ad" label, integrating them more seamlessly into the visual layout of search results. This design shift aims to increase click-through rates and boost Apple's revenue from its advertising business.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with strong criticism, viewing this as a significant step in the wrong direction for Apple and a classic example of "enshittification." Commenters expressed concern that Apple is prioritizing profit over user experience and safety, a trend they believe has accelerated under its current leadership. The discussion highlighted several key themes:

*   **Erosion of Trust and Safety:** Many users argued that the App Store is already plagued by scams, particularly fake or copycat apps that impersonate popular services. By making ads blend in more, Apple risks increasing the number of users who accidentally install malicious or overpriced applications, undermining the platform's core promise of security.
*   **Capitalist Inevitability:** A recurring sentiment was that this move is an unavoidable consequence of capitalism. As companies like Apple reach the natural limits of growth through hardware innovation, they turn to monetizing their existing user base through services and advertising. Commenters noted that Amazon's paid search results are a massive business, suggesting Apple is simply following a proven, albeit user-hostile, model.
*   **Decline in Apple's Vision:** Several threads lamented a perceived decay in Apple's product philosophy. The change was attributed to "spreadsheet-driven" management replacing visionary design, with some users nostalgically referencing the era of Steve Jobs or Scott Forstall. This was framed as Apple's "Ballmer moment"—a period of stagnation before a potential innovator (an "Apple Nadella") can turn things around.
*   **Platform Lock-in and Lack of Alternatives:** Despite the anger, there was a cynical consensus that users are unlikely to leave the Apple ecosystem. The "walled garden" is effective, and the alternatives (like Android) are often seen as equally problematic. This leaves users feeling trapped and punished for their loyalty, with Apple aware that the inconvenience of switching is a powerful retention tool.
*   **Comparison to Google:** The new design was frequently compared to the Google Play Store, which has long used similar ad-heavy layouts. This comparison was used to frame Apple's move not as an innovation, but as a descent to a lower standard previously associated with its competitors.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 278 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint study analyzed research published in top journals on social media and found that nearly half of the papers had disclosable ties to industry (funding, collaboration, or employment). However, the majority of these ties were not disclosed in the published work. The study indicates that industry-tied research receives more attention from academics, policymakers, and the media, but tends to focus less on the negative impacts of platform-scale features. The authors conclude that industry influence is extensive, impactful, and often opaque, calling for stronger disclosure norms.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reflects a mix of resignation, cynicism, and calls for practical action. Many commenters expressed unsurprise at the findings, drawing parallels to other industries like pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels, and tobacco, noting that industry often funds the research relevant to its own products due to a lack of alternative funding sources. There was a significant sentiment of distrust and "doom-scrolling" fatigue, with some users joking about moving to a forest to disconnect, while others offered pragmatic advice like adding friction to social media usage (e.g., deleting apps and typing URLs manually) to reduce mindless consumption.

Debate emerged regarding the ethics of corporate research versus academic oversight. One thread argued that social media companies operate without the strict ethical oversight applied to academic researchers (such as animal studies), viewing their unregulated experimentation on human populations as alarming. A counterpoint argued that academic ethics committees are often overly bureaucratic and that the private sector offers a more efficient research environment.

A notable point of discussion was the inherent difficulty in separating expertise from industry, as many qualified researchers work in the private sector simply because that is where the funding and jobs exist. Finally, a meta-discussion questioned the credibility of the study itself, with one user ironically asking about the study's own potential undisclosed ties.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 262 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that Big Tech lobbying has significantly influenced the European Union's recent legislative agenda, leading to a "roll-back" of digital rights. It details how major US tech companies have exerted pressure on EU institutions to weaken regulations, particularly in the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). The piece highlights specific instances where industry lobbying allegedly watered down provisions designed to protect user privacy, ensure fair competition, and curb disinformation, ultimately prioritizing corporate interests over citizen rights and European sovereignty.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, focusing on political disillusionment, geopolitical strategy, and economic realities.

A dominant theme is deep cynicism toward the EU's political class. Several commenters express the view that the European Commission is beholden to "pro-corporate, anti-citizen" interests and US influence, with one user noting that masks are off regarding this allegiance. There is a pervasive sense of powerlessness, with users arguing that standard democratic processes like complaining on social media or even street protests are ineffective against entrenched political power.

Geopolitics, specifically the "Trump effect," is a major point of contention. Some commenters hope that the current US administration's aggressive stance (e.g., threats against Greenland) will force Europe to recognize US unreliability, thereby catalyzing a necessary break from dependency on American tech and military protection. However, others are skeptical, pointing out that such shocks historically lead to temporary outrage followed by acceptance, and that the UK's post-Brexit trajectory serves as a cautionary tale rather than a model for independence.

The discussion also touches on economic and regulatory trade-offs. While the article frames the situation as a rights rollback, some dissenters argue that the EU's complex regulatory environment stifles its own economic competitiveness, driving companies away. This perspective suggests the EU's legislative push is self-sabotaging, making it difficult for European firms to compete globally.

Finally, there are calls for consumer and political action. A few users advocate for boycotting American products and services to foster European alternatives, though others are skeptical about the feasibility and longevity of such grassroots movements. The conversation also includes demands for investigations into corruption within the European Commission, with links provided to relevant oversight bodies.

## [Wikipedia: WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46677106

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia page for "WikiProject AI Cleanup," a community initiative to identify and remove AI-generated content from the encyclopedia. The project aims to combat the influx of low-quality, unsourced, or fabricated text produced by large language models. It provides guidelines and heuristics for detecting AI writing, focusing on specific stylistic markers and factual inaccuracies rather than just vague stylistic cues. The project's goal is to maintain Wikipedia's reliability and human-curated quality standards in the face of automated content generation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a nuanced and divided community response to the rise of AI-generated content on Wikipedia. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A primary theme is the debate over the validity of the cleanup project itself. While many agree with the need to remove unsourced or fabricated content, some question the metric of "sounding like AI," arguing that verifiability should be the only criterion. Others defend the project by clarifying that it targets specific, obvious AI artifacts and policy violations, not just stylistic tics. There's also a counterpoint that Wikipedia's own policies, such as allowing temporary accounts, may contribute to the problem of low-quality contributions.

Another significant thread explores the use of AI for constructive purposes beyond text generation. Commenters point to a recent paper on using LLMs to find contradictions within Wikipedia as a more valuable application. They suggest that AI could be better used for tasks like fact-checking, building knowledge graphs to verify edits in real-time, or even rephrasing poorly written but factually correct articles, rather than generating new content.

Finally, several users discuss practical solutions for accessing a "pre-LLM" version of Wikipedia. Suggestions include using the platform's built-in history feature, downloading a snapshot via Kiwix, or utilizing the Internet Archive. One commenter shares a personal project, PickiPedia, which uses an MCP server to flag AI contributions for human verification, though they note its limitations in the broader Wikipedia context.

## [Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 46686640

> **Article:** Porsche announced that in 2025, it sold more "electrified" vehicles (battery-electric and plug-in hybrids) than pure internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in Europe. However, the article also notes a global sales decline of 10% year-over-year, with a significant 26% drop in the crucial Chinese market. The company attributes some of these challenges to strategic decisions to prioritize quality and customer experience over immediate volume growth.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the broader implications of Porsche's sales data, focusing on three main themes: the rise of Chinese automotive manufacturers, the definition of "electrified" sales, and the future of the Porsche brand.

Commenters widely interpreted the sales data as a signal of a shifting global automotive landscape. Many argued that the decline in Porsche's sales in China—coupled with the rapid growth of domestic brands like BYD, NIO, and Xiaomi—indicates that China is establishing itself as the new dominant force in the EV market. Some participants expanded this view, suggesting that Chinese manufacturers are not just targeting the EV niche but aiming to unseat traditional giants like Toyota for overall global market leadership.

There was also a technical clarification regarding Porsche's terminology. Users pointed out that "electrified" includes plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), not just pure battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). This distinction led to a debate about whether these figures represent a true shift to full electrification or a transitional phase, especially given reports that Porsche is scaling back some of its all-electric future plans.

Finally, the discussion questioned the long-term viability and appeal of the Porsche brand in an electric era. Several commenters expressed skepticism about the design and technology of Porsche's new EVs, describing them as "ugly" and lacking the brand's traditional character, such as the engine rumble. There was a sentiment that as EVs become more standardized "appliances," the prestige of legacy badges like Porsche may diminish, particularly as Chinese competitors offer more advanced features at lower price points. This skepticism was compounded by news of significant financial losses at Porsche, leading some to conclude that the brand is in serious trouble.

## [Nvidia contacted Anna's Archive to access books](https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46677628

> **Article:** A class-action lawsuit expanded to include authors' claims alleges that Nvidia directly contacted the shadow library Anna's Archive to secure high-speed access to millions of pirated books for AI training. Internal documents reportedly show that executives authorized the acquisition of approximately 500 terabytes of data, bypassing slower scraping methods to fuel models like "NextLargeLLM." Nvidia is defending its actions as "fair use," arguing that books are merely statistical correlations for its models. The lawsuit highlights the tension between large tech companies' need for vast datasets and copyright laws, particularly as Nvidia, a hardware manufacturer, enters the software and AI model development space.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of Nvidia, with commenters expressing disbelief at the company's justification of using pirated content as "fair use." Many argue that while using a single book for analysis might be fair use, ingesting the entire corpus of published literature to train commercial models is clearly infringement. There is a strong sentiment that Nvidia's wealth and power allow them to flout copyright laws, with some noting the irony of a $4 trillion company seeking illicit data rather than licensing it.

Commenters also dissected the logistics and motivations behind the move. It was noted that Nvidia needed Anna's Archive specifically for high-speed access to the 500TB dataset, as standard scraping was too slow. Several users pointed out the hypocrisy of Nvidia relying on pirated data while simultaneously being a "legitimate" entity, contrasting this with the illegitimate status of the archive itself. The conversation broadened to include speculation about other tech giants, like Amazon, and whether they have similarly utilized copyrighted data. Ultimately, the discussion highlights a growing concern that AI companies are desperate for data, willing to risk legal repercussions to advance their models, and that current copyright frameworks are ill-equipped to handle the scale of AI training.

## [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46682518

> **Article:** The article provides a detailed, hands-on review of Apple's Nano Texture glass, a matte-like anti-glare finish available on high-end displays like the Pro Display XDR and iPad Pro. The author contrasts it with traditional glossy screens, highlighting its primary benefit: near-total elimination of reflections, which makes it ideal for bright or variable lighting environments. The review covers the visual trade-offs, noting that while glare is reduced, the screen can appear slightly softer or less vibrant compared to glossy glass. It also details the specific, meticulous cleaning process required, emphasizing the need for the included microfiber cloth and avoiding harsh chemicals to preserve the delicate surface. The author concludes that for users frequently working in reflective conditions, the Nano Texture is a worthwhile upgrade despite its premium cost and maintenance requirements.

> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on three main themes: the practicalities of ownership, the visual trade-offs of the technology, and cleaning methods. A prominent point of humor and frustration is the cost and replacement of the specialized polishing cloth, with users noting it's a $19 accessory if lost. There's a technical debate about the display's performance, with some commenters criticizing the article for not showing enough contrast comparisons and arguing that matte screens traditionally wash out blacks. Others defend the technology, explaining that the benefit is comfort in bright environments where glossy screens become unusable due to reflections, making the trade-off worthwhile for specific workflows. Finally, a detailed sub-thread debates the safety of using alcohol for cleaning screens; while Apple officially permits a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for the Nano Texture, commenters warn that alcohol can damage oleophobic coatings on other devices and share personal, long-term cleaning methods that contradict official guidelines.

## [Nova Launcher added Facebook and Google Ads tracking](https://lemdro.id/post/lemdro.id/35049920)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46686655

> **Article:** The article reports that Nova Launcher, a popular third-party launcher for Android, has been updated to include tracking and advertising SDKs following its acquisition by a new company. The update (version 8.2.4) introduced Facebook Ads, Google AdMob, and additional analytics and crash reporting tools (including Branch, Bugsnag, Google CrashLytics, and Firebase Analytics) that were not present in previous versions.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is largely one of disappointment and concern over privacy, with many users feeling betrayed by the changes. The discussion centers on finding alternatives, with users recommending open-source launchers available on F-Droid. Several users shared their strategies for mitigating the issue, such as using older versions of Nova with network access blocked (especially on privacy-focused operating systems like GrapheneOS) or denying the app internet permissions entirely.

There is a debate regarding the necessity of switching. While some users are immediately seeking replacements due to privacy principles, others argue that since Nova is "feature-complete" and older versions may not have significant security vulnerabilities, they can continue using the legacy software without updating. A few users suggested specific alternatives like Smart Launcher, though there is a general consensus that Nova's customization features remain unmatched by competitors.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** A Wall Street Journal article cites a study confirming that the tariffs imposed on imported goods are being paid primarily by American consumers and businesses, not by foreign exporters. The study reinforces the standard economic principle that import taxes are passed down the supply chain, leading to higher prices for American buyers and increased costs for U.S. manufacturers who rely on imported materials.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the tariffs, viewing them as a self-inflicted economic wound rather than a strategic trade tool. The consensus is that tariffs function as a regressive tax on Americans, with costs ultimately passed to consumers.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Economic Reality vs. Political Rhetoric:** Commenters express frustration that the economic impact is obvious—tariffs raise prices—yet political narratives persist that foreign countries pay the cost. Several users noted that the tariffs are particularly damaging because they tax manufacturing inputs, making U.S. production more expensive and less competitive globally.
*   **Psychological Justification:** A notable thread discussed how supporters rationalize the increased costs. One user shared an anecdote about a contractor who previously couldn't afford expensive American-made tools; now that tariffs have raised the price of cheaper imports, the price gap has narrowed, making the domestic option seem more justifiable. However, commenters argue this is a flawed perspective that ignores the broader economic drag of higher costs on business and consumer purchasing power.
*   **Fiscal Policy and Debt:** The conversation touched on the macroeconomic context. Users pointed out that tariff revenue (approx. $90 billion) is a drop in the bucket compared to the federal deficit (approx. $600 billion). There was a sentiment that the tariffs serve as a regressive revenue stream to offset tax cuts for the wealthy and fund military spending, rather than a sound industrial strategy.
*   **Geopolitical Consequences:** There is significant concern regarding the long-term damage to U.S. credibility. Commenters argued that allies are diversifying away from U.S. supply chains to avoid future volatility. The fear is that even if trade policies change in the future, the trust is broken, and other nations will prioritize domestic or alternative manufacturing bases, permanently eroding American economic influence.
*   **Lack of Strategic Vision:** Several users criticized the administration for tariffing inputs without a coherent plan to rebuild the industrial base, describing the policy as chaotic rather than teleological.

## [Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46678550

> **Question:** A user on Hacker News asked COBOL developers how AI coding tools are affecting their work. The question seeks to understand the practical impact of AI on maintaining and developing legacy systems, a domain often perceived as resistant to modern automation trends.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revealed a divided but nuanced perspective on AI's role in the COBOL ecosystem. One camp reported positive experiences, noting that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax aligns well with how Large Language Models (LLMs) process text. These developers use fine-tuned models for tasks like code generation and documentation search, though they emphasize that AI is an assistant, not a replacement for human oversight.

Conversely, other developers expressed skepticism, citing challenges such as the prevalence of proprietary COBOL variants that lack sufficient training data and the critical nature of financial systems where "vibe coding" is unacceptable. A key theme was the necessity of human expertise; several commenters argued that effectively using AI requires developers to act as architects, providing precise prompts and thoroughly vetting the output. The conversation also touched on broader themes, with some participants drawing parallels to other legacy languages like Fortran and ColdFusion, and others debating whether AI's impact on programming is a fundamental paradigm shift or simply an evolution of developer tools.

## [There's a hidden Android setting that spots fake cell towers](https://www.howtogeek.com/theres-a-hidden-android-setting-that-spots-fake-cell-towers/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46683833

> **Article:** The article highlights a hidden Android setting, primarily available on the Pixel 10 series, that alerts users when their phone connects to a base station that does not use a cryptographic certificate. This feature is designed to detect fake cell towers (IMSI catchers), which often rely on older, unencrypted protocols like 2G to intercept communications. The article explains that while users can manually disable 2G fallback to mitigate risks, this specific setting provides a proactive warning when a potentially malicious tower is encountered. The feature's effectiveness is tied to specific hardware capabilities in newer Pixel devices, making it unavailable on most other Android phones or older models.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of skepticism, practical advice, and frustration regarding cell tower security. A central theme is the limited utility of the warning without actionable solutions; users question what to do when a fake tower is detected, noting that simply knowing you are compromised doesn't solve the problem. There is significant debate over hardware limitations, with users pointing out that even flagship Samsung phones lack the option to disable 2G entirely, forcing them to remain vulnerable despite 2G being obsolete in many regions.

Users also compare Android and iOS capabilities, noting that iOS requires enabling "Lockdown Mode" to disable 2G, which sacrifices other features. The conversation touches on the broader political context, with cynicism that governments have little incentive to enforce encryption standards that would hinder surveillance. Finally, there is confusion about the specific device requirements, with clarification that the feature is exclusive to the Pixel 10 series (and possibly Pixel 9 Pro), rather than a universal Android setting.

## [Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46683947

> **Article:** A TechCrunch article reports that Meta's Threads has surpassed X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile users, citing new data. The article highlights that a year ago, X had twice as many daily active users in the U.S. as it does now. It also notes that Threads benefits from a massive distribution funnel, as it requires an Instagram account for sign-up, though this is not mandatory in all regions like France.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a skeptical and nuanced view of the reported user metrics, focusing on the quality of engagement and the platforms' underlying structures.

Several users questioned the validity of the data. One commenter pointed out a discrepancy between the article's claim of a 50% drop in U.S. users and the provided graph, which showed a decline from 150 million to 125 million worldwide. Another user noted that Threads' growth is heavily aided by Meta's ecosystem, with constant cross-promotion on Instagram and automatic co-posting, creating a network effect that X lacks. Skepticism was also raised based on HN-specific metrics, with one user observing that links to X vastly outnumber those to Threads on Hacker News, suggesting a different user base.

The discussion also delved into the perceived decline of X. Commenters described X as a "shadow of its former self," citing algorithmic changes that no longer prioritize followed accounts, a lack of genuine interaction, and an increase in bots and abandoned accounts. Some defended X's continued value for niche communities like the AI/tech ecosystem, while others noted that the platform's shift to a more right-wing orientation has alienated a significant portion of its audience. The conversation also toucheded on the broader issue of social media consolidation, with some users advocating for decentralized alternatives like Bluesky, Mastodon, and Lemmy as preferable to moving between "walled gardens" controlled by billionaires.
