## [American importers and consumers bear the cost of 2025 tariffs: analysis](https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/)
**Score:** 713 | **Comments:** 706 | **ID:** 46680212

> **Article:** The linked article from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy analyzes the economic impact of the 2025 U.S. tariffs. It concludes that, contrary to political claims that foreign exporters would pay the tariffs, the costs are overwhelmingly borne by American importers and consumers. The analysis uses event studies and trade data to show that export prices from targeted countries (like Brazil and India) did not decrease in response to the tariffs; instead, trade volumes collapsed. This indicates that foreign suppliers maintained their prices, leaving U.S. businesses and consumers to absorb the additional costs. The report frames the tariffs as an "own goal" for the American economy, resulting in higher prices and reduced trade efficiency without the intended benefits of shifting the financial burden abroad.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's economic conclusions while branching into political, legal, and ideological debates. The consensus among commenters is that the economic principle at play is basic: tariffs function as a tax on imports, and in most market conditions, this cost is passed down to the consumer rather than absorbed by the exporter.

Several distinct themes emerged in the conversation:
*   **Economic Consensus and Market Dynamics:** Many users expressed that the findings were obvious "Economics 101" concepts. They argued that export prices remained stable because foreign producers operate on thin margins and cannot absorb the tariffs without going bankrupt. Consequently, U.S. consumers faced higher prices, or products became unavailable as trade volumes dropped. Some debated the elasticity of supply, noting that while China’s producer prices remained flat, indicating the U.S. bore the cost, other markets might see slight price adjustments.
*   **Political Motivation and Incompetence:** A significant portion of the discussion questioned the intent behind the tariffs. Some speculated that the trade collapse was the intended result—aimed at reducing imports rather than generating revenue—while others viewed it as a result of incompetence or a lack of understanding of economic consequences by policymakers. There was also cynicism regarding the political narrative, with users noting that the administration continued to claim foreign countries would pay the tariffs despite evidence to the contrary.
*   **Legal and Institutional Concerns:** Commenters raised concerns about the separation of powers, specifically regarding the President's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. The discussion referenced potential Supreme Court intervention and the administration's reported contingency plans to replace justices or bypass judicial rulings, highlighting fears that the tariffs might be deemed an unconstitutional tax.
*   **Ideological and Geopolitical Context:** The conversation touched on broader economic theories, with users debating whether the tariffs represented a misguided return to mercantilism or a crude attempt to address global trade imbalances favored by some Keynesian economists. There was also skepticism regarding the source of the analysis (a German think tank), with some users dismissing it due to national bias, while others defended the credibility of the data regardless of origin.

## [Radboud University selects Fairphone as standard smartphone for employees](https://www.ru.nl/en/staff/news/radboud-university-selects-fairphone-as-standard-smartphone-for-employees)
**Score:** 508 | **Comments:** 237 | **ID:** 46676276

> **Article:** Radboud University in the Netherlands has selected the Fairphone as the standard smartphone for its employees. The announcement highlights the device's modular design, which allows for easy repair and replacement of parts, aligning with the university's sustainability goals and its in-house IT maintenance capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely praises the university's decision, focusing on the practical and environmental benefits of using a repairable phone in an institutional setting. A key theme is the efficiency of in-house repairs; commenters note that universities already possess IT service desks, and stocking Fairphone parts allows for quick, on-site fixes, which is more cost-effective and convenient than sending devices to external repair shops or replacing them entirely.

However, the conversation also critically examines Fairphone's viability and broader market issues. Some users shared anecdotes of friends being disappointed by Fairphone's reliability, while others pointed out that buying second-hand phones is likely more environmentally sustainable. Specific product shortcomings were also highlighted, such as the lack of optical zoom cameras and the use of USB 2.0 ports, which some see as a dealbreaker compared to competitors.

The discussion expanded to include a desire for greater repairability across the entire smartphone industry, with calls for legislation to mandate user-replaceable batteries and screens. A separate but related thread emerged from users expressing a need for a non-Google/Apple smartphone alternative, particularly one with a headphone jack and a smaller form factor, though commenters noted the challenges of app compatibility on smaller screens and the niche status of alternatives like Sailfish OS or Linux-based tablets.

## [Amazon is ending all inventory commingling as of March 31, 2026](https://twitter.com/ghhughes/status/2012824754319753456)
**Score:** 485 | **Comments:** 251 | **ID:** 46678205

> **Article:** Amazon is ending its inventory commingling program for third-party sellers, effective March 31, 2026. Commingling allowed different sellers to pool identical items in Amazon's fulfillment centers, meaning a customer buying from a trusted seller could still receive a product sourced from a less reputable third party. The end of this policy means that when a customer buys from a specific seller, they will receive the actual inventory from that seller, ensuring authenticity and traceability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely welcomed the announcement, viewing it as a long-overdue correction to a system that prioritized logistics efficiency over product integrity. Many commenters shared personal experiences of receiving counterfeit or substandard goods despite ordering from reputable sellers, citing issues with items like HDMI adapters and printer toner. The consensus is that this change will restore trust in Amazon's marketplace, particularly for high-risk categories where counterfeits are common.

The discussion also explored the reasons behind Amazon's decision. While some believe the company finally acknowledged that the reputational damage from counterfeiting outweighed the logistical benefits, others took a more cynical view, speculating that the change was forced by financial penalties from major brands or large buyers who were burned by the system.

Several users expressed frustration that it took Amazon over a decade to address a well-known problem, with some stating the change is too little, too late to win back their business. The conversation broadened to include general dissatisfaction with Amazon's market power and service quality, with some users advocating for buying directly from manufacturers' websites. A notable tangent involved an analogy to the Kenyan coffee system, where commingling beans from different farms created a "race to the bottom" that discouraged quality—a parallel to the issues seen on Amazon's platform.

## [Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963)](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html)
**Score:** 460 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46683205

> **Article:** The article is Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," written in April 1963. Addressed to fellow clergymen who criticized his civil rights demonstrations as "unwise and untimely," the letter is a defense of nonviolent direct action. King argues that individuals have a moral responsibility to break unjust laws, doing so openly and accepting the penalty to arouse the community's conscience. He distinguishes between just and unjust laws, defines the "white moderate" as a greater obstacle to freedom than overt segregationists, and refutes the idea that progress should be delayed for a "more convenient season."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on King's "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" is multifaceted, focusing on the letter's philosophical arguments, its relevance to modern politics, and personal reflections on its impact.

A central theme is the nature of civil disobedience and the distinction between legality and justice. Commenters highlight King's argument that breaking an unjust law openly and accepting the penalty is a form of respect for law, contrasting this with the chaos of anarchy. This principle is linked to the founding of the United States and the works of Henry David Thoreau. However, this discussion also extends to modern events, with one user suggesting the letter's logic could be misinterpreted to defend the non-violent January 6th Capitol rioters, a point immediately countered by others who emphasized the riot's violent nature.

The most prominent political takeaway for many commenters was King's critique of the "white moderate." Several users directly applied this concept to contemporary American politics, particularly within the Democratic Party. They drew a parallel between the "white moderate" who prioritizes order over justice and the modern "liberal" establishment, which they argue favors incrementalism and donor interests over the more radical demands of the party's progressive base. This was illustrated with examples like the party leadership's response to the murder of a woman by an ICE agent, where proposed reforms (body cameras) were seen as insufficient compared to calls for abolition. One commenter countered this view by arguing that if such progressive ideas consistently fail in elections, it may indicate they lack broad voter support rather than being suppressed by the establishment.

The discussion also included historical context and personal reflections. One user challenged the popular narrative of nonviolence, suggesting it was only effective because it was backed by the "very real looming rod" of more militant groups like the Black Panthers, framing King's approach as the "carrot" in a dual-strategy. Many commenters shared how the letter was a required and impactful part of their education, with several stating they reread it annually and find new meaning in it each time. The letter's timeless passages on the misuse of time, the "appalling silence of the good people," and the emotional weight of explaining segregation to a child were frequently cited as particularly powerful and enduring.

## [Level S4 solar radiation event](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-geomagnetic-storm-levels-reached-19-jan-2026)
**Score:** 394 | **Comments:** 136 | **ID:** 46684056

> **Article:** The article links to a NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) news post announcing a G4 (Severe) geomagnetic storm event that occurred on January 19, 2026. The post details the severity of the solar radiation event and the resulting impact on Earth's magnetosphere. The primary purpose of the alert is to inform the public and relevant industries (such as power grid operators and aviation) about potential disruptions caused by the solar storm.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused primarily on the visual spectacle of the aurora borealis (Northern Lights) caused by the storm, with users sharing photos and webcam links from Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. A significant portion of the conversation criticized the NOAA website's accessibility, noting that the warning text was presented as an untranscribed image rather than accessible text.

Technical and safety concerns were also raised. Users discussed the intensity of the storm (G4 level), comparing it to the historic Carrington event (G5), and shared resources regarding power grid monitoring (PJM Interconnection). While some users expressed concern about preparedness for a more severe "Carrington-level" event, the general sentiment remained relatively calm, with many treating the event as a visual curiosity rather than an immediate threat to infrastructure. The visibility of the aurora was noted to be exceptional, visible even to the naked eye in some areas despite light pollution.

## [GLM-4.7-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash)
**Score:** 348 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46679872

> **Article:** The article links to the Hugging Face page for GLM-4.7-Flash, a new open-weight large language model released by the Z.ai team. It is a 31-billion-parameter model (a distilled version of the larger GLM-4.7) designed to offer high performance in a smaller, more accessible size for local deployment and fine-tuning.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the release with a mix of technical analysis, practical deployment advice, and benchmark comparisons. The conversation centered on the model's size and performance relative to existing options.

Key discussion points included:
*   **Performance and Benchmarks:** Users debated the model's capabilities, noting that while it is a 31B model, its reported performance on coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench) is competitive with larger models like GPT-4o mini and o3. However, some skepticism was raised about benchmark validity, with users comparing its size and performance to OpenAI's GPT-OSS 20B and 120B models.
*   **Local Deployment and Accessibility:** A major theme was the model's suitability for local use. Users highlighted that its 31B parameter size makes it feasible to run on consumer hardware (e.g., Macs with 32GB RAM or GPUs with 24GB VRAM). There was significant interest in quantized versions (GGUF) for use with llama.cpp, with users sharing specific commands and links to 4-bit quantizations to lower the hardware barrier.
*   **Practical Usage and Cost:** The discussion included practical experiences with the GLM family. One user shared a negative experience with the Cerebras inference platform for the non-Flash version, citing aggressive rate limits and high costs due to a lack of token caching, which made it less practical than competitors like GPT-5.2-Codex.
*   **Provider Availability:** For those unable to run the model locally, users pointed out that it was already available through cloud providers like z.ai and Novita, with more expected to follow soon.
*   **Context within the LLM Landscape:** Commenters viewed the release as a solid incremental improvement, continuing the trend of open models lagging behind top-tier proprietary models by roughly a year but becoming increasingly capable and accessible for specific use cases like fine-tuning and local coding assistance.

## [What came first: the CNAME or the A record?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards/)
**Score:** 340 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46681611

> **Article:** Cloudflare's blog post details an incident where a change to their authoritative DNS servers caused widespread outages for clients that expected a specific ordering of DNS records. The issue stemmed from an ambiguity in RFC 1034, which states that CNAME records should "preface" the answer but does not explicitly mandate that they must appear before A records in the response packet. Cloudflare interpreted this loosely and began returning A records before CNAMEs in some cases. This broke several major DNS clients, most notably the `getaddrinfo` function in the GNU C Library (glibc) and the DNS client in Cisco switches, causing service disruptions. Cloudflare reverted the change and proposed a new standard to explicitly require CNAMEs to appear first, acknowledging that de facto client behavior overrides ambiguous standards.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely focuses on the engineering and process failures behind the incident, with a consensus that Cloudflare should have known better. Commenters express surprise that a company of Cloudflare's scale failed to test against glibc, one of the most common DNS client implementations on Linux. Several users dissect the RFC wording, arguing that the ambiguity cited by Cloudflare is a misinterpretation and that the text clearly implies CNAMEs should precede A records.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Testing and Rollout:** Many commenters criticize Cloudflare's testing regimen, noting that a comprehensive test suite should have caught the issue immediately. The incident is viewed as a failure of standard deployment practices rather than an unavoidable edge case.
*   **RFC Interpretation:** There is significant debate over the "ambiguity" of RFC 1034. Several users argue that the phrase "possibly preface" clearly refers to the presence of CNAMEs, not their optional ordering, suggesting the fault lies with Cloudflare's reading of the standard rather than the standard itself.
*   **Postel’s Law vs. Reality:** The discussion touches on Postel's Law ("be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send"). While some initially defended this principle, others noted that strict adherence can be harmful in modern infrastructure, as it perpetuates reliance on broken implementations. The consensus leans toward the idea that Cloudflare should simply adhere to the de facto standard (ordering CNAMEs first) to maintain compatibility with older, unpatched devices.
*   **Hyrum’s Law:** The incident is cited as a textbook example of Hyrum's Law—where users depend on observable behaviors (like record order) regardless of what the official contract (RFC) promises.

## [Apple testing new App Store design that blurs the line between ads and results](https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/16/iphone-apple-app-store-search-results-ads-new-design/)
**Score:** 337 | **Comments:** 251 | **ID:** 46680974

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is testing a new App Store design that blurs the line between organic search results and advertisements. The new layout reportedly presents paid placements more seamlessly within search results, making them appear more like standard app listings. This change is seen as a further step by Apple to expand its high-margin advertising business, potentially increasing revenue but raising concerns about user experience and the clarity of search results.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant negativity, largely viewing the design change as a decline in quality and a move toward "enshittification." The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Capitalist Inevitability:** Many commenters argued that this move is an unavoidable consequence of corporate growth demands. As one user noted, "Capitalism pretty much demands it," suggesting that even a company like Apple must eventually prioritize revenue growth over user experience once market saturation is reached.
*   **Erosion of Trust and Safety:** Users expressed concern that blurring ads with results exacerbates existing problems with scams and copycat apps. Several commenters pointed out that the App Store is already plagued by impersonators, and this change could make it even harder for users to distinguish legitimate apps from paid imposters, undermining the "safety" argument Apple often uses to justify its closed ecosystem.
*   **Comparison to Competitors:** The discussion frequently compared Apple to Google. Some noted that the Android Play Store has operated this way for years, while others argued that Apple is chasing Google's ad revenue but failing to recognize that the App Store's exclusivity doesn't guarantee similar profitability.
*   **Leadership and Innovation:** A recurring sentiment was that Apple is in a period of organizational decay under Tim Cook, driven by spreadsheets rather than product vision. Several commenters invoked the "Ballmer moment" analogy, suggesting Apple has lost its innovative edge and needs a visionary leader (like a hypothetical return of Scott Forstall or a "Nadella-like" figure) to pivot away from this decline.
*   **User Apathy:** Despite the complaints, a counter-argument emerged suggesting that users are unlikely to leave the "Walled Garden." The consensus was that Apple's lock-in is too strong, and users—particularly those invested in the ecosystem—will tolerate these changes rather than switch to Android, which faces similar ad-infiltration issues.

## [Nearly a third of social media research has undisclosed ties to industry](https://www.science.org/content/article/nearly-third-social-media-research-has-undisclosed-ties-industry-preprint-claims)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46682534

> **Article:** A preprint analysis of social media research published in top journals found that nearly a third of studies have undisclosed ties to industry, such as prior funding, collaboration, or employment. The study claims that these industry-tied papers receive more attention from academics, policymakers, and the media, yet often focus less on the negative impacts of platform-scale features. The authors argue that this influence is extensive and opaque, calling for stronger disclosure norms and policies to ensure the integrity and visibility of independent research.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely reflects a cynical and unsurprised reaction to the findings, with many commenters viewing undisclosed industry influence as a systemic issue rather than an isolated problem. Several users drew parallels to other sectors like pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels, and tobacco, suggesting this is a pervasive issue in any field where industry holds the purse strings. There was a notable sentiment of distrust and disillusionment, with some commenters expressing a desire to disconnect from technology entirely, while others offered more pragmatic advice like adding "friction" to social media use to reduce mindless consumption.

The conversation also branched into related topics. One significant thread debated the ethics of research conducted by social media companies themselves, with some arguing these companies operate without the independent ethical oversight required in academia, while others countered that such oversight can be overly bureaucratic. Another point of discussion was the practical reality that expertise and funding in a specialized field often come from the industry itself, making it difficult to find truly independent researchers. The conversation was punctuated by cynical humor and a meta-discussion about the potential biases of the study itself.

## [Porsche sold more electrified cars in Europe in 2025 than pure gas-powered cars](https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2026/company/porsche-deliveries-2025-41516.html)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 295 | **ID:** 46686640

> **Article:** Porsche announced that in 2025, it sold more "electrified" vehicles (battery-electric and plug-in hybrids) than pure internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in Europe. However, the company's global deliveries fell by 3% year-over-year, with a significant 28% drop in the crucial Chinese market. The report highlights the shifting dynamics in the luxury automotive sector, where electrification is growing but overall sales are facing headwinds in key regions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused less on the specific sales milestone and more on the broader implications for Porsche and the global automotive industry. A central theme was the distinction between "electrified" (which includes plug-in hybrids) and "pure electric" (BEV), with many commenters noting that this classification inflates the EV figure. The most prominent topic was the competitive threat from Chinese automakers. Users pointed to Porsche's steep sales decline in China as evidence that domestic brands like BYD are rapidly overtaking legacy manufacturers, not just in EVs but potentially in the overall global market.

Beyond the sales figures, there was significant debate about Porsche's product strategy and brand identity. Several commenters criticized the design and technology of Porsche's new electric Macan and Cayenne, arguing they lack the brand's traditional appeal and are technologically outmatched by Chinese competitors. This led to a broader discussion on whether luxury car brands can maintain their prestige as cars become more like "appliances." While some argued that brand loyalty and the "Veblen good" nature of luxury cars would protect Porsche, others were more pessimistic, citing the company's recent financial losses and strategic pivots back toward internal combustion engines as signs of deeper trouble. The conversation also touched on the reliability of German cars versus the unknown long-term reliability of new Chinese EVs.

## [Article by article, how Big Tech shaped the EU's roll-back of digital rights](https://corporateeurope.org/en/2026/01/article-article-how-big-tech-shaped-eus-roll-back-digital-rights)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46678430

> **Article:** The article from Corporate Europe Observatory argues that Big Tech lobbying has successfully weakened EU digital regulations, resulting in a "roll-back of digital rights." It details how major US tech companies have influenced legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the AI Act to favor corporate interests over citizen protections. The piece frames this as a capitulation to US corporate power, facilitated by a European Commission that prioritizes economic competitiveness and transatlantic relations over robust privacy and antitrust enforcement. It highlights specific instances where lobbying efforts allegedly watered down key provisions intended to curb monopolistic practices and protect user data.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is multifaceted, centering on the tension between digital rights, economic competitiveness, and geopolitical strategy. A dominant theme is the critique of the EU's regulatory approach, with some commenters arguing that excessive regulation stifles European innovation and drives companies away, while others contend that the EU is capitulating to US corporate interests at the expense of citizen privacy.

Geopolitics, particularly the Trump administration's policies, is viewed through a dual lens. Some see the antagonism towards the US as a "silver lining" that might force Europe to develop its own tech sovereignty and resist American corporate overreach. However, others warn that this volatility could backfire or that Europe is too dependent on US infrastructure to pivot effectively.

There is significant skepticism regarding the EU's political will and susceptibility to corruption. Commenters express cynicism about the European Commission's integrity, suggesting investigations into potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding meetings between Meta and far-right MEPs.

Finally, the feasibility of consumer-led resistance, such as boycotting American tech products, is debated. While some advocate for European alternatives, others point out the practical difficulties of sustaining such movements and the lack of widespread public concern regarding digital rights in Europe. The conversation ultimately reflects a deep pessimism about the ability of democratic institutions to resist powerful corporate lobbying in the face of complex geopolitical pressures.

## [Wikipedia: WikiProject AI Cleanup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_AI_Cleanup)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 85 | **ID:** 46677106

> **Article:** The article links to the Wikipedia page for "WikiProject AI Cleanup," a community initiative to identify and remove AI-generated content from the encyclopedia. The project's goal is to maintain Wikipedia's quality and reliability by flagging text that exhibits common traits of LLM output, such as overly generic phrasing, incorrect formatting, or "hallucinated" citations. It provides guidelines for editors to detect such content and emphasizes that deletion should be based on policy violations (e.g., lack of reliable sources) rather than just the stylistic "feel" of the text.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a nuanced community response, moving beyond simple pro- or anti-AI stances. A central theme is the tension between Wikipedia's core principle of sourcing and the stylistic hallmarks of AI-generated text. While some argue that a verifiable source is the only metric that should matter, others contend that AI-generated content is often low-effort, prone to subtle inaccuracies, and stylistically homogenous, making it a net negative for the encyclopedia's quality. The conversation highlights that the project's goal is not to delete content based on a vague "AI feel," but to use specific textual markers as a signal to scrutinize content more closely, especially for missing or incorrect citations.

Several interesting sub-themes emerged. One is the desire for a "pre-LLM" Wikipedia, with users discussing methods to access historical snapshots, such as using the site's own version history or downloading pre-2023 data dumps via tools like Kiwix. Another is the potential for more constructive uses of AI on Wikipedia, with commenters pointing to research on using LLMs to detect factual contradictions across articles, a task seen as more valuable than text generation. The discussion also touched on the irony of Wikimedia selling data access to AI companies while simultaneously fighting AI-generated "slop," though one user clarified this was a pragmatic move to manage server load, not a contradiction. Finally, a few comments expressed a broader frustration with recent changes to Wikipedia's interface and policies, viewing the AI cleanup effort as another symptom of the platform's evolving, and sometimes frustrating, user experience.

## [Nvidia contacted Anna's Archive to access books](https://torrentfreak.com/nvidia-contacted-annas-archive-to-secure-access-to-millions-of-pirated-books/)
**Score:** 209 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46677628

> **Article:** A class-action lawsuit filed by book authors alleges that NVIDIA executives authorized the use of millions of pirated books from Anna's Archive to train its AI models. According to internal documents cited in the suit, NVIDIA directly contacted the shadow library to secure high-speed access to the data, as standard web scraping was too slow for the 500 terabyte dataset. NVIDIA is defending its actions by claiming "fair use," arguing that books are merely "statistical correlations" for its AI models.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with widespread criticism toward NVIDIA, focusing on the hypocrisy of a multi-trillion-dollar company relying on pirated content while simultaneously pursuing legal action against other entities. Commenters largely dismissed NVIDIA's "fair use" defense, arguing that ingesting the entire corpus of published literature to train commercial LLMs constitutes mass infringement rather than protected transformative use. There was significant skepticism regarding NVIDIA's justification that the data was necessary, with some suggesting it was merely for marketing "tech ads" rather than essential model development.

The discussion also highlighted the broader industry context, noting that NVIDIA's access to pirated archives reveals the extreme hunger for training data that legitimate sources cannot satisfy. Users speculated that other tech giants, such as Amazon, likely utilize similar datasets. The tone was cynical, with many predicting that despite the lawsuit, NVIDIA's legal resources would likely shield them from meaningful consequences, while the practice of "slurping" copyrighted data for AI training would continue unabated.

## [Notes on Apple's Nano Texture (2025)](https://jon.bo/posts/nano-texture/)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46682518

> **Article:** The article "Notes on Apple's Nano Texture" is a hands-on review of Apple's anti-glare screen technology, which uses a nano-etched surface to scatter reflections. The author compares the Nano Texture finish on a MacBook Pro against a standard glossy display, evaluating its performance in various lighting conditions. The review concludes that the technology is a worthwhile upgrade for users who frequently work in bright or unpredictable environments, as it significantly reduces distracting glare. However, the author notes the trade-off: the matte finish slightly softens image sharpness and can make blacks appear less deep compared to a glossy screen. The piece also touches on the maintenance requirements, specifically the need for the included specialized cleaning cloth to avoid damaging the delicate surface.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the practical trade-offs of Apple's Nano Texture, with users debating the visual compromises and maintenance costs. A primary theme is the visual quality trade-off: while some users appreciate the glare reduction for general productivity, others criticize the review for not adequately demonstrating how the matte finish reduces contrast and "washes out" blacks, particularly in dark environments or when viewing high-contrast content.

Maintenance and cost were also significant points of contention. Users humorously lamented losing the included cleaning cloth, noting that Apple sells a replacement for $19. There was a technical debate regarding cleaning methods, with users discussing the safe use of isopropyl alcohol (70%) to remove smudges, while cautioning that alcohol can strip oleophobic coatings from standard glossy screens.

Finally, the discussion touched on hardware availability and manufacturing. Several commenters noted that the Nano Texture is currently limited to the heavier MacBook Pro models and the iPad Pro, not the MacBook Air. While Apple holds the patents, the actual panel manufacturing is likely handled by third parties like Samsung, though the specific etching process is proprietary.

**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46686273

> **Article:** The article links to Reticulum, an open-source, secure, and anonymous mesh networking stack designed to operate over diverse physical media including LoRa, TCP/IP, and serial connections. It functions as a foundational network layer (akin to TCP/IP) that enables decentralized communication without reliance on centralized infrastructure. The project has reached version 1.0.0, with user-friendly applications like MeshChat and Sideband (Android) available to facilitate adoption.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with significant interest, viewing Reticulum as a timely solution for resilient, off-grid communication. Users discussed its technical versatility, noting it runs on any device supporting Python 3.8+ and can utilize interfaces ranging from LoRa radios and serial connections to standard internet protocols. A key point of comparison was Meshtastic; commenters highlighted that Reticulum is more robust, efficient, and supports significantly more hops (128 vs. 7), though Meshtastic is currently more popular for simple chat.

However, a major concern raised was the project's long-term viability. While the technology was praised for its capabilities—particularly the seamless bridging of different link types and the use of cryptographic identities for addressing—users noted that the project is maintained by a single developer. This concern was validated by a recent announcement that the maintainer is stepping back from public interaction and community support, leading to uncertainty about future development. Additionally, a restrictive license clause prohibiting use in AI training datasets sparked debate regarding its compatibility with GitHub's terms and open-source principles.

## [Americans Are the Ones Paying for Tariffs, Study Finds](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/americans-are-the-ones-paying-for-tariffs-study-finds-e254ed2e)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46683519

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports on a study confirming that U.S. consumers and businesses are bearing the cost of recent tariffs, rather than foreign exporters. The study indicates that the financial burden is being passed through supply chains, resulting in higher prices for imported goods and manufacturing inputs, which ultimately impacts American purchasing power and business costs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the tariffs, with a consensus that they function as a tax on American consumers rather than a penalty on foreign nations. Many commenters express frustration that the economic mechanics of tariffs—which are widely understood in economic circles—remain politically contentious, with some voters and politicians maintaining the belief that exporting countries pay the cost.

The conversation highlights several key themes:
*   **Economic Impact:** Users discuss the practical consequences, noting that tariffs on manufacturing inputs increase costs for U.S. industries, thereby making domestic goods more expensive and less competitive. One user proposed a counter-intuitive idea of subsidizing exports to boost economies of scale, though this was acknowledged to be financially unsustainable.
*   **Political Psychology:** A significant portion of the debate focuses on the perception of tariffs. Commenters analyze how supporters rationalize higher costs as a necessary step to support American manufacturing, despite the immediate financial hit to their own businesses. There is a strong sentiment that conservative media successfully frames these economic penalties as patriotic victories.
*   **Fiscal Policy:** The discussion touches on the macroeconomic context, with users pointing out that tariff revenue is insufficient to offset massive government spending or debt servicing. The tariffs are characterized as a regressive tax used to compensate for other fiscal policies, such as tax cuts for the wealthy.
*   **Geopolitical Consequences:** Several users express concern that the U.S. is damaging its global credibility and accelerating the decline of its empire. There is a fear that trading partners will permanently shift supply chains away from the U.S., eroding long-term economic and political influence regardless of future policy changes.

## [Ask HN: COBOL devs, how are AI coding affecting your work?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46678550)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 173 | **ID:** 46678550

> **Question:** The user asks how AI coding tools are affecting the work of COBOL developers. The question implies a curiosity about whether the scarcity of public COBOL code affects AI performance compared to more modern languages.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a split between those using AI effectively for legacy code and those skeptical of its capabilities. A developer in banking reported success using fine-tuned models, noting that COBOL's verbose, English-like syntax aligns well with LLM processing. Others shared experiences using AI to maintain or migrate legacy systems (like ColdFusion), emphasizing that success depends on detailed prompting and treating the AI as a tool for a developer to review, not a replacement.

However, several commenters expressed doubt regarding COBOL specifically. Some argued that the lack of public training data and the existence of proprietary "flavors" of COBOL limit general models, while others humorously noted that COBOL is already obscure to humans, making it a "safe" job from AI. A broader debate emerged about the nature of AI coding, with some comparing it to the shift from Assembly to high-level languages, while others countered that LLMs are non-deterministic and fundamentally different from compilers. The consensus among experienced users was that AI is a productivity aid for tedious tasks, but human oversight remains essential for production-ready code.

## [There's a hidden Android setting that spots fake cell towers](https://www.howtogeek.com/theres-a-hidden-android-setting-that-spots-fake-cell-towers/)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46683833

> **Article:** The article highlights a hidden Android setting, primarily available on the Pixel 10 series, designed to detect and alert users to "fake" or suspicious cell towers (often called IMSI catchers or "Stingrays"). These devices mimic legitimate cell towers to intercept communications. The feature works by leveraging specific hardware and software capabilities that allow the phone's modem to communicate network security status to the OS. The article notes that while iOS allows users to disable 2G connections (a common vulnerability), it does not offer a specific "fake tower" detection alert like this Android feature.

## [Threads edges out X in daily mobile users, new data shows](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/18/threads-edges-out-x-in-daily-mobile-users-new-data-shows/)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 149 | **ID:** 46683947

> **Article:** A TechCrunch article reports that Meta's Threads has surpassed X (formerly Twitter) in daily mobile users, citing data from Similarweb. The article highlights that Threads' growth is significantly aided by its integration with Instagram, which provides a massive user funnel and cross-promotion opportunities. While X still leads in overall app revenue and web traffic, Threads has seen a 51% growth in daily active users over the past year, whereas X's usage has declined by approximately 15% in the same period.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a skeptical and multifaceted critique of the reported user metrics and the broader social media landscape. A primary theme is the questioning of data validity; users point out that Threads' growth is heavily inflated by its mandatory integration with Instagram, which provides a built-in distribution advantage that X lacks. There is also significant debate regarding X's actual user base, with commenters suggesting that its reported numbers include many abandoned accounts and bots, and that engagement among remaining active users appears to be declining.

The conversation frequently shifts to platform quality and user experience. Many participants express a sense of fatigue with "walled gardens" and corporate consolidation, though this is countered by the observation that Threads supports ActivityPub (the Fediverse protocol), making it technically more open than X. Regarding X specifically, opinions are divided: some argue the platform has degraded into a "shadow of its former self" due to algorithmic changes and a perceived shift in political alignment, while others maintain it remains the superior platform for niche professional communities (e.g., AI/tech) and real-time information discovery.

Finally, there is a broader sentiment of disillusionment with the current state of social media, characterized by a migration toward alternatives like Bluesky and Mastodon, or a general withdrawal from these platforms entirely.
