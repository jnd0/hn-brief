# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-23

## [We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports](https://curl.se/.well-known/security.txt)
**Score:** 892 | **Comments:** 581 | **ID:** 46717556

> **Article:** The article links to cURL's security.txt file, which contains a new, strongly-worded policy warning that the project will publicly ban and ridicule individuals who submit low-quality, AI-generated, or otherwise wasteful security reports. This is a direct response to cURL being flooded with "AI slop" reports, which has prompted the project to also remove its bug bounty program to eliminate the financial incentive for such submissions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates cURL's frustration, with many commenters sharing similar experiences of being overwhelmed by low-effort, AI-generated reports and pull requests on their own open-source projects. The conversation centers on the broader trend of AI making it cheap to generate nonsense, which disproportionately burdens maintainers who must manually review these submissions. While some users suggest alternative solutions like requiring discussions before issue creation or moving to niche platforms, others express skepticism that rudeness will deter AI operators, who may simply copy-paste responses without feeling the intended social impact. The discussion also touches on pre-existing issues like Hacktoberfest spam and academic pressures, framing the current AI problem as an acceleration of long-standing challenges in open-source maintenance.

## [Show HN: isometric.nyc – giant isometric pixel art map of NYC](https://cannoneyed.com/isometric-nyc/)
**Score:** 792 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46721802

> **Project:** The project is an interactive isometric pixel art map of New York City, created using generative AI models. The creator, a Googler, wrote a detailed blog post explaining the process, which involved using AI to generate the massive amount of art required for the map. The post discusses the technical challenges, the use of tools like Cursor and Gemini-CLI, and the philosophical implications of using AI for creative work. The creator argues that while AI makes content generation easy (turning it into a commodity), it elevates the importance of human "love" and vision as the key differentiator for true art.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, centering on the project's technical impressiveness and the broader philosophical debate about AI's role in creativity. Many commenters praised the visual result and the detailed write-up, with several requesting similar maps for other cities like San Francisco and Tokyo. However, a significant portion of the conversation focused on the ethics and impact of generative AI. One prominent thread questioned the project's value, arguing that the scale of AI-generated content devalues human artistry and that the project's existence, enabled by AI, might not be a net positive. The creator and other users countered that this is a common pattern with new technologies and that AI's ability to automate the "hard parts" allows human creativity to focus on vision and intent. Technical issues with the site's availability were also noted, with the creator explaining it was due to rate-limiting.

## [GPTZero finds 100 new hallucinations in NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers](https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/)
**Score:** 781 | **Comments:** 422 | **ID:** 46720395

> **Article:** The article from GPTZero claims to have identified 100 instances of AI-generated "hallucinations"—specifically, fabricated citations to non-existent papers and authors (e.g., "Firstname Lastname," "John Doe")—within papers accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 conference. The findings suggest that LLM-generated content is bypassing peer review processes, raising alarms about the integrity of scientific research and the reliability of academic vetting in the age of AI.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses significant alarm and cynicism regarding the findings, viewing them as evidence of a systemic failure in academic peer review rather than just an isolated issue of author misconduct. Commenters broadly agree that this phenomenon will harm scientific research, with many noting that the ease of generating plausible but false content exacerbates existing problems like data falsification and p-hacking.

A central theme is the breakdown of the peer review process. Several commenters, including current reviewers, admit that they do not have time to verify every reference, relying instead on trust in the authors. This is contextualized by the massive scale of conferences like NeurIPS, where the volume of submissions makes thorough vetting economically and logistically difficult. Consequently, some argue that the problem isn't new—research has long been driven by "optics" and "fake it 'til you make it" mentalities—but AI has simply made the fabrication process effortless and more visible.

There is a strong call for stricter accountability and a shift in academic culture. Suggestions include mandating reproducible code (the "PoC or GTFO" approach), punishing researchers who use AI to generate content without disclosure, and shifting scientific journalism to focus on reproduced results rather than just initial claims. However, there is also significant skepticism toward the detection methods themselves; commenters question the reliability of AI detectors and the need for a baseline comparison to understand if hallucination rates are truly higher than pre-LLM human error rates.

## [In Europe, wind and solar overtake fossil fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels)
**Score:** 532 | **Comments:** 544 | **ID:** 46719491

> **Article:** A Yale e360 article reports that in 2024, wind and solar power generated more electricity in Europe than fossil fuels for the first time. Combined, renewables produced 30% of the continent's electricity, surpassing the 29% from gas, coal, and oil. This milestone is attributed to a decade of steady growth in renewable capacity, which has compounded to reach a tipping point. The article notes that while this is a significant achievement for the power sector, it represents only a portion of Europe's total energy consumption, which still relies heavily on fossil fuels for transportation and heating.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the geopolitical, economic, and technical implications of Europe's renewable energy milestone. A prominent theme was the geopolitical relationship between China, Russia, and Europe. Some commenters argued that a self-isolating Russia, dependent on China as its primary economic partner, serves China's interests. Others contended that China benefits from the ongoing war in Ukraine as it distracts the West, allowing China to pursue its own strategic goals, such as its ambitions regarding Taiwan.

The conversation also heavily focused on the economics of the energy transition. Commenters from North America and Australia shared anecdotes about the low cost and high value of residential solar installations, contrasting this with high electricity prices in Europe. The debate explored whether these high costs are a necessary investment for energy security and independence from volatile fossil fuel markets, or a competitive disadvantage for European industry compared to the US and China. The role of political influence from both fossil fuel and renewable energy lobbies was also debated.

Finally, the discussion addressed the technical challenges of the transition. Several users pointed out that the article's data pertains only to electricity generation, not total energy consumption, which remains dominated by fossil fuels in transport and heating. However, others highlighted promising trends, such as the rapid adoption of EVs and heat pumps, and the falling cost of battery storage. The declining price of batteries was identified as a key factor in solving the intermittency of renewables, potentially making them cheaper than gas peakers for meeting evening energy demand.

## [Qwen3-TTS family is now open sourced: Voice design, clone, and generation](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115)
**Score:** 528 | **Comments:** 169 | **ID:** 46719229

> **Article:** Alibaba's Qwen team has open-sourced the Qwen3-TTS family, a suite of text-to-speech models capable of high-quality voice generation, design, and cloning. The release includes models of varying sizes (0.6B to 1.8B parameters) and supports features like cross-lingual voice cloning, where a voice can speak in a language it was not originally recorded in. The models are available on Hugging Face, and the team's blog post provides examples and technical details.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction is a mix of awe at the technology's capabilities and concern over its implications. Many commenters were immediately struck by the quality of the voice cloning, with some describing it as "terrifying" and "uncanny good." Several users noted that the English audio samples on the official blog had a distinct "anime voice" or "Miyazaki-style dub" quality, suggesting the model may have been trained heavily on such content.

Practical use cases were a major theme. Users with collections of old, degraded audio (like vintage radio plays) expressed excitement about the potential for restoration, where the AI could intelligibly fill in unintelligible sections. However, this high fidelity also sparked significant concern about misuse, with commenters warning about the potential for scams, misinformation, and the need to treat all digital media as potentially fake.

On the technical side, users discussed implementation. While some provided links to Hugging Face and GitHub resources for running the models locally, there was a notable issue with hardware compatibility, particularly for those without NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., Mac users). A workaround was mentioned, but the general consensus was that running it locally requires some technical effort. The discussion also branched into broader AI politics, with one user expressing distrust of the Qwen team's leadership, while another made a passing critical remark about the leadership of a competing US-based AI company.

## [I was banned from Claude for scaffolding a Claude.md file?](https://hugodaniel.com/posts/claude-code-banned-me/)
**Score:** 447 | **Comments:** 338 | **ID:** 46723384

> **Article:** The article details the author's experience of being unexpectedly banned from using Claude Code. The author speculates that the ban was triggered by their workflow of "scaffolding" a `Claude.md` file, which involved running multiple instances of Claude in a loop to generate and evaluate prompt instructions. The post highlights the lack of communication from Anthropic regarding the specific reason for the ban and the absence of a functional support channel to appeal the decision.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the broader implications of the ban rather than the technical specifics of the author's workflow. Many commenters expressed frustration with the lack of recourse when dealing with AI platform bans, sharing personal anecdotes of being blocked without explanation or support. A recurring theme was the "black box" nature of AI moderation, which prioritizes safety over accuracy, leading to false positives like the one the author likely experienced.

There was significant debate over the validity of the author's claim that scaffolding caused the ban. While some interpreted the blog post as describing a complex, circular multi-agent process that could trigger security heuristics, others remained skeptical, suggesting the ban might have been for unrelated reasons or that the author's description was unclear.

The conversation also pivoted to the state of customer support in the AI industry. Several users criticized Anthropic for not using its own AI technology to improve customer service, viewing the lack of support as a strategic risk. The discussion concluded with a strong sentiment favoring local LLMs as a way to avoid the unpredictability and limitations of hosted services, with many commenters advising the author to move to a self-hosted solution for greater control and stability.

## [Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over "heroes"](https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/)
**Score:** 390 | **Comments:** 382 | **ID:** 46719222

> **Article:** The article links to a piece discussing Douglas Adams's observations on the cultural divide between English and American storytelling, specifically regarding the concept of a "hero." Adams argued that American heroes are defined by competence, autonomy, and the drive to overcome obstacles and succeed. In contrast, English heroes are often reluctant, bumbling, and defined by their struggle against insurmountable odds, where the journey and the manner of coping are more important than the ultimate victory. The English celebrate the "gentleman loser"—the capable person who fails with dignity—while American narratives favor the triumphant underdog who ultimately wins.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates Douglas Adams's thesis, with users exploring its nuances through various cultural lenses. The consensus leans toward agreeing with the distinction, particularly regarding humor and narrative tone.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Validation through Modern Examples:** Several users noted that while the divide exists, modern American media has evolved to be more compatible with British sensibilities. Shows like *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* were cited as examples where American characters are "terrible people" facing comeuppance, aligning closer to the British "loser" archetype. Similarly, YouTube creators in the "maker" and trades communities (e.g., *This Old Tony*) were praised for exhibiting a self-deprecating humor that feels distinctly British.
*   **Counter-Examples and Nuance:** Some commenters challenged the generalization, pointing to American cultural icons like Charlie Brown or *The Peanuts* as beloved "lovable losers" who rarely succeed. However, other users countered that Americans often view Charlie Brown with contempt rather than sympathy, reinforcing the idea that failure is seen as a moral shortcoming rather than an inevitable part of the human condition.
*   **Comparison to Other Cultures:** The discussion expanded beyond the Anglo-American divide to include Japanese storytelling (specifically Hayao Miyazaki), noted for its moral complexity and nuanced characters, contrasting with the binary "good vs. evil" often found in Hollywood.
*   **The Role of Adaptation:** Users analyzed the differences between the UK and US versions of *The Office*, noting that the American version was intentionally made more optimistic and sunny (both visually and tonally) to suit US audiences, serving as a direct case study of the cultural shift Adams described.
*   **Criticism of Generalization:** A minority of comments argued that distilling entire nations' cultures into binary traits is reductionist and pseudo-intellectual, citing examples like *Lord of the Rings* (English literature with a reluctant hero) to show that exceptions exist within every tradition.

## [Why does SSH send 100 packets per keystroke?](https://eieio.games/blog/ssh-sends-100-packets-per-keystroke/)
**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 231 | **ID:** 46723990

> **Article:** The article by "eieio" investigates why SSH connections generate a high volume of network packets (approximately 100 packets per keystroke) when used for a high-performance terminal game. The author traces this behavior to SSH's keystroke timing obfuscation feature, which sends "chaff" packets to mask the timing of user input and prevent traffic analysis attacks. While this security feature is valuable for sensitive sessions, it introduces significant overhead for the author's game, consuming about 20% of a CPU core just to handle the packet volume. The author details their debugging process, which involved forking Go's `crypto/ssh` library to disable the obfuscation, resulting in a dramatic performance improvement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical trade-offs between security and performance, as well as the author's unconventional choice of SSH for a high-performance game.

Key technical points included:
*   **Performance Optimization:** Commenters suggested alternative methods to reduce packet count, such as using `TCP_CORK` to buffer data or disabling `TCP_NODELAY`. The author responded that while `TCP_NODELAY` would incur an unacceptable latency penalty, `TCP_CORK` was an interesting avenue to explore.
*   **SSH's Overhead:** Some users were surprised by the high CPU cost of SSH's packet rate, questioning if the encryption was the bottleneck. Others defended it, noting the computational cost of encrypting a large number of small packets.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Several users suggested that for a game where security is secondary to performance, using UDP-based protocols (like QUIC or specialized libraries such as GameNetworkingSockets) or even a simple telnet connection would be more appropriate than modifying SSH.

A significant portion of the discussion was meta-commentary on the article itself:
*   **AI Writing Style:** A top-level comment noted the author's overuse of the phrase "smoking gun," which sparked a thread where other users identified this as a common stylistic tic of AI assistants like Claude, listing other frequent "corporate/cringe" phrases.
*   **Security Concerns:** Some commenters expressed alarm at the idea of disabling SSH's keystroke obfuscation, emphasizing its importance in preventing timing-based attacks. Others countered that for the author's specific use case (a game), the security trade-off was justified and well-explained.
*   **Upstreaming the Change:** There was a debate on whether the author's modification to disable obfuscation should be submitted as a configurable option to the upstream Go `crypto/ssh` library. While some supported the idea for its utility, others were skeptical, citing the library's opinionated and inflexible nature.

## [Bugs Apple Loves](https://www.bugsappleloves.com)
**Score:** 373 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46727587

> **Article:** The article is a single-page website titled "Bugs Apple Loves," which lists a collection of persistent, long-standing software bugs across Apple's ecosystem (macOS, iOS, etc.). The bugs listed are described as minor but frustrating issues that have remained unfixed for years, such as Spotlight search freezing, Bluetooth audio stuttering on macOS, and issues with Apple Watch unlock. The site appears to be a humorous, crowdsourced effort (linked to a GitHub organization "polymath-ventures") highlighting the gap between Apple's reputation for polish and the reality of its software quality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the site's premise, with users sharing their own frustrations with Apple's software quality. The conversation centers on the root causes of these persistent bugs. While some commenters initially suggest that hiring more engineers would solve the problem, others argue that the issue is one of business priorities; Apple has plenty of engineers, but they are often directed toward new features and "10X" projects rather than paying down technical debt.

There is a consensus that Apple's focus on polish has diminished over time, with a specific mention of the "Snow Leopard" era (an OS release focused solely on bug fixes) as a bygone ideal. Users also shared personal anecdotes illustrating the difficulty of dealing with Apple's ecosystem, such as creating developer accounts, issues with custom email domains, and the inability to search mail effectively on iOS without using the Gmail app. The discussion concludes with a shared sentiment that while Apple engineers likely care about these bugs, the company's release cycle and prioritization of new hardware and features prevent them from being addressed.

## [It looks like the status/need-triage label was removed](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/16728)
**Score:** 279 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46721179

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the `google-gemini/gemini-cli` repository where the `status/need-triage` label was removed. The core of the issue is a feedback loop involving the `gemini-cli[bot]`. The bot repeatedly added and removed the same label from the issue, leaving a comment each time to explain its action. This cycle repeated for approximately 4,600 iterations, creating a massive and noisy thread.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the absurdity and consequences of the AI-driven feedback loop. Commenters were amused and dismayed by the "stupidity" of the future, with one user lamenting the lack of flying cars in favor of bots squabbling over labels.

A key point of analysis was the scale of the incident. Users noted the loop ran for over 4,600 cycles, which would have generated an enormous number of email notifications for anyone subscribed to the repository—potentially tens of thousands of emails. This led to speculation about who pays for the computational cost of these infinite inference calls.

The conversation also explored the technical nature of the bug. While one commenter initially framed it as a "classic CI bug," others pushed back, arguing it was more specifically an issue of self-referential automation without proper loop detection. There was debate over whether this was a fundamental flaw in the LLM's design (which lacks a sense of self or awareness of its own previous actions) or simply a poorly configured script using canned responses. The incident was noted as a recurring problem in this specific repository, with links to several other similar bot-fighting issues provided.

Finally, the discussion branched into relatable analogies from the pre-AI era, such as a poorly configured Salesforce automation that created an email loop, highlighting that while the technology is new, the principle of cascading automation failures is a classic engineering pitfall.

## [Design Thinking Books (2024)](https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-books/)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46718061

> **Article:** The article is a curated list of recommended books on "Design Thinking" published in 2024. It aims to provide a collection of essential reading for professionals and students interested in the methodology, covering foundational texts, practical guides, and theoretical perspectives on user-centered problem-solving.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely bypassed the specific book list to debate the value and definition of "Design Thinking" itself. The conversation revealed several distinct themes:

*   **Criticism of Design Thinking as a Concept:** A prominent thread of skepticism questioned the term's substance. Some commenters argued it's an over-simplified, branded version of more robust disciplines like Systems Thinking, while others felt it was merely a re-branding of "good old regular design" to make it more corporate-friendly.

*   **Recommendations for Omitted Classics:** Many users felt the article missed foundational texts. The most frequently cited omissions were Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" (for web usability) and Fred Brooks's "The Design of Design" (from a software engineering perspective). Tom Kelley's "Creative Confidence" was also suggested as a key inspirational book.

*   **Practicality vs. Theory:** A debate emerged around the practical application of design theory. One developer found "The Design of Everyday Things" (a book frequently praised in the comments) to be overly academic and not very practical. In response, another user recommended "Refactoring UI" as a more hands-on guide for developers and engineers.

*   **General Skepticism and Humor:** The discussion also included lighter notes, such as a user critiquing the article's authorship by pointing out a typo, and another commenter humorously misinterpreting the topic as "designing books that think."

## [Capital One to acquire Brex for $5.15B](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/capital-one-buy-fintech-firm-brex-515-billion-deal-2026-01-22/)
**Score:** 258 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46725288

> **Article:** Capital One is acquiring the fintech firm Brex for $5.15 billion. This represents a significant decrease from Brex's peak valuation of $12.3 billion in 2021, though the company has reportedly grown its revenue substantially since then.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is centered on the financial implications of the deal, particularly the steep valuation discount from Brex's 2021 peak. Commenters are divided on whether this is a "bad deal" for Brex. Many argue it's a poor outcome for late-stage investors and especially for employees with stock options, who are described as "taking a haircut" or being "fucked big time" due to the lower exit price. However, others counter that for a company that only raised $1.7 billion, this is still a very good outcome for founders and early investors.

A key theme is the context of the "post-ZIRP" (Zero Interest Rate Policy) era. Commenters attribute Brex's high valuation to the previous period of "fintech exuberance" and low interest rates, and see this acquisition as a market correction where valuations are trending back to fundamentals. Some compare Brex unfavorably to competitors like Ramp, suggesting it failed to pivot successfully in the new economic climate.

From the acquirer's perspective, many see this as a smart move for Capital One, giving them a valuable customer base and infrastructure at a "fair price" (around 7x revenue). There is speculation about what will happen to Brex's staff, with some predicting layoffs while others note Capital One's history of letting acquired companies operate with autonomy. Finally, a tangential discussion point emerged regarding a recent settlement against Capital One for deceptive marketing of savings accounts, adding a layer of skepticism about the acquiring company's own practices.

## [30 Years of ReactOS](https://reactos.org/blogs/30yrs-of-ros/)
**Score:** 245 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46716469

> **Article:** The article celebrates the 30th anniversary of ReactOS, an open-source operating system project aiming for binary compatibility with Windows applications and drivers. It reflects on the project's long history, technical challenges, and ongoing development efforts to create a clean-room implementation of a Windows-like OS.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of admiration for the project's longevity and skepticism about its practical future. Many commenters express respect for the engineering feat and the dedication of the developers, with some even daydreaming about bankrolling the project to completion. However, the consensus leans towards ReactOS being a "purely for engineering" exercise rather than a viable product, often compared to GNU Hurd as a noble effort that missed its window of opportunity.

A central theme is the competition from alternative solutions. Users point out that for running Windows software, Wine/Proton on Linux has made far more practical progress, especially for modern applications and games. The practical alternatives of using modern Windows, older Windows versions for legacy hardware, or Linux with Wine are seen as covering most use cases, reducing the incentive for widespread adoption or contribution to ReactOS.

Technical and legal challenges are also heavily discussed. The use of AI (like Claude Code) to accelerate development is met with caution due to the risk of copyright infringement, as the project legally requires contributors to affirm they have never seen leaked Windows source code, and AI models may have been trained on such leaks. The project's unique value proposition—driver compatibility—is acknowledged, but it's noted that ReactOS still struggles with modern hardware. The conversation concludes with a sense that while ReactOS has made tangible progress recently (e.g., a working package manager), it remains a long-term endeavor, akin to nuclear fusion, perpetually "30 years from completion."

## [Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers](https://lambdaland.org/posts/2026-01-21_tree-sitter_vs_lsp/)
**Score:** 230 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46719899

> **Article:** The article "Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers" compares two technologies used in modern code editors. Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool that creates fast, error-tolerant parsers, primarily used for syntax highlighting, code folding, and structural editing. It operates locally and is known for its low latency. Language Servers, part of the Language Server Protocol (LSP), provide a more comprehensive suite of IDE-like features such as autocompletion, go-to-definition, and diagnostics by communicating with a dedicated server process. The author concludes that the two are not mutually exclusive but complementary: Tree-sitter excels at fast, syntax-aware tasks, while LSPs handle deeper semantic analysis. The article also touches on the author's preference for writing content without AI assistance.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News provided a deeper technical analysis and expanded on the article's points. Key themes included:

*   **Complementary Roles and Latency:** Commenters largely agreed that Tree-sitter and LSPs serve different purposes. A prominent point, articulated by user Fiveplus and confirmed by others, was that Tree-sitter's speed is ideal for immediate syntax highlighting, while LSPs can provide slower, asynchronous semantic highlighting (e.g., distinguishing between mutable and immutable variables). This hybrid approach prevents editor sluggishness and "flash of unstyled content." A Roslyn architect (Metasyntactic) elaborated that modern LSPs are designed for high performance, often using incremental parsing to achieve microsecond response times, making them suitable even for real-time UI updates.

*   **Scope and Implementation:** Several users corrected the perception that Tree-sitter's language support is limited to what's available in a specific package manager (like Arch's). They pointed to broader ecosystems, such as the `tree-sitter-language-pack`, which includes parsers for many languages like R, YAML, and Go. The discussion also highlighted Tree-sitter's value beyond editing, such as for developing custom programming languages.

*   **Semantic Depth:** A key distinction raised was the level of analysis. While Tree-sitter provides a concrete syntax tree (CST), LSPs offer semantic understanding. User thramp (from the rust-analyzer team) gave a powerful example of semantic highlighting in Rust, where bindings can be colored differently based on their mutability—a feature that requires deep language analysis impossible for a purely syntactic tool like Tree-sitter.

*   **Practical Concerns and Resources:** The conversation included practical advice for developers. One user asked about managing binary size when bundling multiple Tree-sitter grammars, with suggestions involving distributing language packs as WASM modules. Another user seeking to build a browser-based editor was provided with a comprehensive list of resources, including the LSP specification, tutorials on parser implementation, and the Tree-sitter documentation.

*   **AI in Writing:** A side discussion emerged about the author's note on not using AI to write articles. Several commenters supported this stance, arguing that the process of writing forces a distillation of thought that AI-generated content often lacks, leading to more insightful and reliable articles.

## [Macron says €300B in EU savings sent to the US every year will be invested in EU](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qjtvtl/macron_says_300_billion_in_european_savings_flown/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 188 | **ID:** 46722594

> **Article:** French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announced a plan to retain and reinvest €300 billion in European savings that currently flow to the United States annually. He framed this as a strategic move to build a "savings and investment union" within the EU, aiming to boost the bloc's competitiveness and strategic autonomy by channeling capital into European ventures rather than US markets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of Macron's announcement, with commenters questioning the feasibility and underlying causes of the capital flight.

A central theme is the critique of the EU's economic environment. Several users argue that capital flows to the US because of more attractive investment opportunities and lower regulatory burdens. One commenter suggests that the EU could stem the outflow by lowering capital gains taxes, while another dismisses the idea entirely, stating that "profitable investment opportunities in the EU remain slim." The difficulty of EU-wide policy reform is also highlighted, with a user pointing to the decades-long failure to finalize a trade deal with Mercosur as evidence that Macron's plan is unrealistic.

There is also significant discussion around the validity of the €300 billion figure itself. One commenter outright accuses Macron of "making up numbers," while another provides a counterpoint on the mechanics of capital flows, arguing that for money to leave the Eurozone, an equal amount must enter from elsewhere in a floating exchange rate system, suggesting the premise might be oversimplified.

Other points of discussion include:
*   **US vs. EU Savings Rates:** A user shared data showing the EU's personal savings rate (18.79%) is significantly higher than the US rate (3.50%), prompting surprise from a European commenter about how many Americans live paycheck to paycheck.
*   **Political Context:** Some believe Macron's statement is more of a political signal to figures like Donald Trump than a concrete economic policy.
*   **Tangential and Humorous Comments:** The discussion also included unrelated remarks, such as a joke about Paul Graham's influence, speculation about Macron wearing sunglasses due to an eye infection, and a reference to a viral tweet.

## [CSS Optical Illusions](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68091/css-optical-illusions)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 14 | **ID:** 46722570

> **Article:** The article "CSS Optical Illusions" by Alvaro Montoro showcases a collection of visual illusions created entirely with CSS. It demonstrates how modern CSS features like gradients, transforms, and animations can be used to replicate complex psychological visual effects, such as the Hermann grid, motion-induced blindness, and color assimilation. The post serves as both a demonstration of advanced CSS techniques and an exploration of visual perception through code.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with enthusiasm, praising the creativity and technical skill involved in creating the illusions. Several users noted the practical applications and potential pitfalls, with one user mentioning they often encounter these effects unintentionally while building UIs, and another suggesting they could be used for CAPTCHAs.

The conversation also delved into the scientific and perceptual aspects of the illusions. Users identified specific illusions by their formal names, such as "extinction illusions" (McAnany's and Ninio's types), and shared links to academic sources for further reading. There was a consensus that the illusions are most effective when interacted with directly in the CodePen environment, as static previews can be misleading. One user shared their own recreation of the Ames window illusion, adding a personal project to the discussion. Overall, the comments reflected a blend of appreciation for the artistry, curiosity about the underlying neuroscience, and interest in practical implementation.

## [ISO PDF spec is getting Brotli – ~20 % smaller documents with no quality loss](https://pdfa.org/want-to-make-your-pdfs-20-smaller-for-free/)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46717507

> **Article:** The article from the PDF Association announces that the ISO PDF specification is being updated to support Brotli compression. This change is expected to reduce PDF file sizes by approximately 20% without any loss of quality. The post highlights that this is a forward-looking feature, with major open-source libraries like MuPDF and Ghostscript already implementing support in their development versions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the decision to adopt Brotli, focusing on three main themes: technical inferiority, questionable motives, and the problem of backward compatibility.

A dominant technical argument is that Brotli is the wrong choice for this use case. Many commenters advocate for Zstandard (zstd), praising its significantly faster decompression speeds, which they argue is a crucial metric for a "read-many" format like PDF. There is also criticism for using Brotli's standard web dictionary, which is seen as ill-suited for PDF content and problematic for long-term archival purposes.

The decision is also viewed with suspicion. Several users suggest the move is a form of "pay-to-play" by a commercial entity (iText) to legalize a proprietary feature in the ISO standard, creating a format that is incompatible with existing readers. This is framed as a cynical move rather than a genuine technical improvement.

Finally, the community points out a major contradiction. The PDF Association claims that new features must work "seamlessly with existing readers," but introducing a new compression algorithm is inherently a breaking change. This will create significant adoption friction, as recipients won't be able to open new PDFs unless they update their software, a process that could take years. The overall sentiment is that the potential 20% size reduction is not worth the ecosystem-wide disruption.

## [Recent discoveries on the acquisition of the highest levels of human performance](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adt7790)
**Score:** 119 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46722853

> **Article:** The article, "Recent discoveries on the acquisition of the highest levels of human performance," challenges the conventional wisdom that early specialization is the key to elite achievement. Drawing on research across chess, sports, and academia, it argues that the individuals who are top performers in their youth are almost entirely different from those who become top performers as adults (a 90% turnover rate). The paper posits that a "sampling period" characterized by diverse interests and lower early-life performance is a more effective path to long-term, world-class success than intense, narrow focus from a young age. The most accomplished individuals often follow a "sampling to specialization" trajectory, exploring broadly before committing to a single domain to achieve mastery.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's findings, with many commenters sharing personal anecdotes and drawing parallels to existing literature. The consensus is that early, intense specialization is not a reliable predictor of ultimate success, and that a period of broad exploration is more valuable.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the statistical interpretation of the research. Several users, including MontyCarloHall and arjie, suggest that the observed phenomenon could be explained by Berkson's paradox (or the "Ugly Surgeon" paradox). They argue that when you select for individuals at the extreme top of a distribution (e.g., top adult performers), you are sampling from a population where early specialization and innate talent are not perfectly correlated. This selection process can create an artificial negative correlation, making it appear that top adult performers were not top performers in their youth, even if there is a positive underlying relationship between early and later performance.

Commenters also connect the findings to broader themes of talent development and career paths. Many point to David Epstein's book *Range* as a popularization of these ideas. The discussion highlights a tension between societal structures that reward early specialization (e.g., academic ladders, elite youth sports) and the evidence suggesting this path filters out many potential late bloomers. Personal stories abound, with users contrasting "naturally smart" kids who coasted on talent and later struggled with discipline against those who developed skills through consistent effort over time. The conversation also touches on the importance of cross-domain knowledge and analogy in fostering creativity, allowing individuals to escape the "local maxima" of a single field. Finally, a debate emerged about the role of "hyperfocus," with one user incorrectly linking the article's findings to ADHD, a claim that was quickly corrected by others who emphasized that ADHD is a clinical disorder, not a superpower for elite performance.

## [White House Posts Digitally Altered Image of Woman Arrested After ICE Protest](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/22/white-house-ice-protest-arrest-altered-image)
**Score:** 116 | **Comments:** 16 | **ID:** 46725268

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports that the White House digitally altered an image of a woman arrested after an ICE protest, making her appear more menacing. When questioned about the alteration, the White House did not deny it but instead posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) from Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr. The response mocked those defending the arrestee and stated that the government's "memes" regarding accused individuals would continue. The article highlights the use of generative AI by the government to create a false contemporaneous image and the official dismissal of concerns regarding the truthfulness of government communications.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focuses on the implications of the White House using digital alteration and AI to manipulate public perception of a protestor. Commenters express alarm at the normalization of fabricating evidence and the government's disregard for judicial process. Several users draw parallels to political instability in other nations, such as South Africa during the "State Capture" years, suggesting the behavior indicates a breakdown of social order. There is specific criticism of the official response, which was characterized as parroting Trump's communication style and dismissing the legal principle of "innocent until proven guilty." While one user questioned the relevance of a specific detail regarding the separation of church and state, the broader consensus among critics was that the incident represents a dangerous precedent for government propaganda.

## [Scaling PostgreSQL to power 800M ChatGPT users](https://openai.com/index/scaling-postgresql/)
**Score:** 115 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46725300

> **Article:** OpenAI's engineering blog post details how they scaled PostgreSQL to support the massive user base of ChatGPT. The article explains that while PostgreSQL is excellent for read-heavy workloads, its native implementation of Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) creates challenges for write-heavy scenarios. Specifically, MVCC causes write amplification (copying entire rows for updates), read amplification (scanning through dead tuple versions), and issues like table/index bloat. To address this, OpenAI offloaded write-heavy, shardable workloads to Azure CosmosDB (a NoSQL database) while continuing to use PostgreSQL for read-heavy workloads, supported by nearly 50 read replicas to keep replication lag near zero.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical trade-offs of database scaling and the nature of OpenAI's engineering choices. A primary theme was the debate over PostgreSQL's scalability limits. Several commenters questioned why OpenAI didn't use PostgreSQL's native sharding capabilities via Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW) and table partitioning, suggesting the solution was already within the PostgreSQL ecosystem. Others defended the decision, noting that migrating to a different system for specific workloads is a common and mature engineering practice to avoid the complexity of a full migration.

There was also a focus on alternative database technologies. One user suggested TiDB as a better solution for high-volume writes due to its underlying LSM-tree structure, while another sarcastically mentioned MongoDB, highlighting the ongoing SQL vs. NoSQL debate. The discussion also touched on the specifics of OpenAI's architecture, with users expressing interest in their replication setup, particularly how they manage lag across 50 read replicas and whether they use asynchronous replication.

Finally, some comments were more meta, discussing the context of the post. This included observations about the author's name and the Azure links, a critique that the article lacked novel technical depth, and a humorous note about Microsoft being "bested" by the open-source PostgreSQL on its own Azure cloud platform.
