# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-23

## [We will ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports](https://curl.se/.well-known/security.txt)
**Score:** 887 | **Comments:** 577 | **ID:** 46717556

> **Article:** The article links to cURL's security.txt file, which now states that they will "ban you and ridicule you in public if you waste our time on crap reports." This is a direct response to the project being flooded with AI-generated bug reports. cURL has also announced it is removing its bug bounty program to eliminate the financial incentive for submitting these low-quality, automated reports.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely supports cURL's decision, with commenters expressing sympathy for the maintainers who are overwhelmed by AI-generated "slop." Many note that this is a predictable consequence of the new AI era, where the cost of generating low-quality reports has dropped to near zero.

A key theme is the broader context of this problem, which predates LLMs. Users draw parallels to past issues like Hacktoberfest, where students would submit trivial or nonsensical pull requests for incentives like free t-shirts. Several commenters share personal anecdotes of seeing similar surges in bad reports, particularly from students in academic settings where reporting vulnerabilities is part of a course requirement.

The discussion also explores potential solutions. One user suggests adopting a model where only maintainers can create issues and all pull requests must be linked to an existing issue, creating a higher barrier to entry. However, another user worries this "gatekeeping" can feel cumbersome for legitimate contributors.

A significant point of debate is the effectiveness of the "ridicule" strategy. While some see it as fair and justified, others are skeptical. One commenter argues that the people submitting LLM-generated reports often don't read the responses or feel the "ego hit" from rudeness, as they are just pasting the output of an AI. They fear this approach might deter legitimate human submitters more than the automated ones.

## [GPTZero finds 100 new hallucinations in NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers](https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/)
**Score:** 746 | **Comments:** 395 | **ID:** 46720395

> **Article:** The article from GPTZero claims to have identified 100 instances of AI-generated "hallucinations" (fabricated data, references, and citations) within papers accepted to the prestigious NeurIPS 2025 AI conference. The report highlights specific examples, such as references to non-existent authors like "John Doe" and "Jane Smith," that passed the conference's peer review process. The central argument is that the proliferation of AI-generated content is undermining the integrity of scientific research and exposing vulnerabilities in academic quality control systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply concerned with the integrity of scientific research and the systemic pressures that enable fraud. The consensus is that the presence of AI hallucinations in accepted papers is a symptom of a broader crisis in academic publishing, rather than a novel problem introduced solely by LLMs.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Systemic Failures in Peer Review:** Many commenters argued that the issue is not just authors using AI, but a peer review system that is overburdened and under-resourced. Reviewers, often unpaid and pressed for time, cannot realistically verify every citation in a growing volume of submissions. This lack of rigorous oversight creates an environment where fabricated content can easily slip through.
*   **The "Fake It Till You Make It" Culture:** Several users noted that a culture of hype, optics, and publication pressure has long existed in AI research. The use of LLMs to generate plausible-sounding but false content is seen as an acceleration of pre-existing trends where substance is sometimes sacrificed for the appearance of innovation.
*   **Debate Over AI's Role and Detection:** While the article blames LLMs, some commenters questioned the reliability of AI detectors and the baseline rate of human-generated citation errors before LLMs. There was skepticism about whether this problem is entirely new or simply more detectable now.
*   **Calls for Stronger Verification:** A recurring suggestion was to shift the focus from trusting authors to demanding verifiable proof. This includes requiring reproducible code (the "PoC or GTFO" principle) and prioritizing the replication of results in scientific reporting over initial, unverified claims.
*   **Severity and Consequences:** The tone was largely one of alarm, with many commenters viewing this as a serious threat to the credibility of science. There were calls for severe consequences, including treating such fraud as a criminal act and "blacklisting" researchers who knowingly submit AI-generated falsehoods.

## [Show HN: isometric.nyc – giant isometric pixel art map of NYC](https://cannoneyed.com/isometric-nyc/)
**Score:** 723 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46721802

> **Project:** The project is an interactive isometric pixel art map of New York City, created by a developer using generative AI (specifically Gemini models) to automate the generation of the massive amount of art required. The creator argues that while AI makes such large-scale projects feasible, it also turns "hard parts" of creation into commodities, shifting the value of art to the "love" and intent behind it. The site experienced initial downtime due to traffic overload.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the philosophical implications of using AI for creative projects. While many users praised the visual result and the detailed technical writeup, a significant thread debated the value of AI-generated art. One commenter expressed concern that the scale of AI output diminishes human expression and creates a loss of craft, questioning if the project "shouldn't exist" simply because it relies on generative models. The creator responded that this is a characteristic of every new technology, balancing excitement for unlocked creativity with sadness for obsolete crafts.

Other comments focused on technical aspects and future requests. Users requested similar maps for other cities like San Francisco and Tokyo, though the creator noted the manual labor involved was substantial. There were also reports of the site being down due to rate limiting and CORS issues, which the creator acknowledged and fixed. A minor sub-thread compared the project to human-made scale models (like a physical NYC sculpture or Minecraft builds) to debate the necessity of AI, while another briefly touched on the developer's choice of coding tools.

## [In Europe, wind and solar overtake fossil fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels)
**Score:** 509 | **Comments:** 522 | **ID:** 46719491

> **Article:** The article from Yale Environment 360 reports that for the first time, wind and solar power have collectively generated more electricity in Europe than fossil fuels. This milestone was reached in 2022, with renewables accounting for 34% of the EU's electricity generation compared to 32% for fossil fuels. The shift is attributed to a decade of steady growth in renewable capacity, accelerated by the energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted a rapid build-out of clean energy infrastructure to ensure energy security.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the geopolitical, economic, and technical implications of this energy transition, with a significant portion of the conversation diverging from the article's core topic.

A major theme was the geopolitical fallout, particularly concerning China and Russia. Commenters debated whether Europe's reduced reliance on fossil fuels would weaken Russia's influence. One perspective argued that China benefits from Russia's economic isolation, as it can exploit Russian resources on its own terms. Another viewpoint suggested China has an interest in the Ukraine war continuing, as a Russian victory would set a precedent for its own territorial ambitions, such as in Taiwan. The conversation also touched on how global distractions, like conflicts in the Middle East, provide China with more freedom to act.

The economic impact on Europe was a highly contentious point. Several users argued that the high cost of electricity in the EU, driven by green energy policies, is crippling its industrial competitiveness compared to the US and China. They contended that consumers and businesses are burdened by high prices, and that politicians are making poor decisions, such as shutting down nuclear power. In response, others defended the high costs as a necessary investment in energy security and independence from volatile regimes. They also pointed out that the US has cheap energy but is still outpaced industrially by China, which is itself a leader in green technology manufacturing. The debate also highlighted the difference between electricity generation and total energy consumption, noting that while renewables are growing, sectors like transportation and heating still heavily rely on fossil fuels.

Technically, the discussion focused on the challenges of intermittency and the role of batteries. Commenters noted that batteries are beginning to displace natural gas for evening peak demand, a key criticism of renewables. The falling cost of batteries, including emerging technologies like sodium-ion, was seen as a critical factor in solving the intermittency problem. The conversation also explored solutions for heating, with heat pumps and large-scale thermal storage (like hot water tanks) identified as cost-effective ways to manage winter energy demand, especially when paired with wind power which is often stronger in colder months. The example of Norway's growing EV fleet was used to show that increased electricity demand from transport has been manageable so far.

## [Qwen3-TTS family is now open sourced: Voice design, clone, and generation](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115)
**Score:** 496 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46719229

> **Article:** The Qwen team has open-sourced its Qwen3-TTS family, a suite of models for voice design, cloning, and generation. The release includes models of varying sizes (0.6B to 1.8B parameters) and capabilities, such as cross-lingual voice cloning, allowing users to generate speech in different languages using a reference voice. The announcement links to a blog post with audio samples demonstrating the technology's quality and versatility.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is a mix of excitement over the technology's capabilities and skepticism regarding its implementation and implications. Many commenters were immediately struck by the quality of the voice samples, with several independently noting that the English voices have a distinct "anime" or "Miyazaki-style dub" quality. This observation was a recurring theme in the discussion.

There was significant interest in practical application and accessibility. Users asked about local implementation, with one developer sharing a command-line interface (CLI) tool they created to make it easier to run. Another user provided a direct link to Hugging Face code examples for those wanting to integrate it into their own projects. A separate question about running it on Macs highlighted that the default setup assumes an NVIDIA GPU, though workarounds were suggested.

The discussion also touched on the potential use cases, particularly for audio restoration. One user expressed chills at the thought of using it to remaster old, damaged radio plays, a sentiment another user echoed regarding a specific series. The quality of voice cloning was described as "uncanny good," with a Hugging Face demo allowing users to test it themselves.

Finally, the release sparked a broader conversation about the societal impact of such accessible technology. One commenter found it "terrifying," arguing that we are "sleepwalking" into an era where everything on a screen should be considered fake unless cryptographically proven otherwise. This sentiment was balanced by others who noted the potential for both good (e.g., a deceased relative reading a bedtime story) and bad (e.g., scams).

## [I was banned from Claude for scaffolding a Claude.md file?](https://hugodaniel.com/posts/claude-code-banned-me/)
**Score:** 403 | **Comments:** 305 | **ID:** 46723384

> **Article:** The article details the author's experience of being banned from using Claude Code (Anthropic's coding assistant) without warning or clear explanation. The author speculates the ban may have been triggered by their process of "scaffolding" a `Claude.md` file, which involved running multiple instances of Claude in a loop to generate and evaluate prompts. The post expresses frustration over the lack of recourse and the opaque nature of AI-driven moderation, which prioritizes safety over accuracy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely centers on the broader issues of opaque bans, lack of customer support from AI companies, and the trade-offs between using hosted services versus local models.

Key themes include:
*   **Confusion over the specific cause:** Many commenters were unclear about what the author actually did, noting that "scaffolding" a file sounds benign, but the description of running multiple instances in a loop sounded more like a "circular prompt injection" or a multi-agent setup that might trigger safety filters.
*   **Frustration with Anthropic's support (or lack thereof):** Several users shared similar experiences of being banned without warning or receiving any meaningful support, even after appealing. This reinforced a sentiment that frontier AI labs have poor customer service infrastructure.
*   **The "local vs. hosted" debate:** A recurring point was that relying on third-party APIs carries the risk of arbitrary bans and service changes. Many argued that for long-term stability and control, running local open-source models is a safer bet, even if they are less capable.
*   **Criticism of AI moderation:** Commenters criticized the "black box" nature of AI moderation, noting that while it claims to prioritize safety, it often lacks accuracy and leaves users with no recourse.
*   **Broader corporate critique:** Some users shifted the focus to Anthropic's business strategy, questioning why the company doesn't use its own AI for customer support if it trusts the technology for coding. Others noted that the lack of support is a significant business risk that could drive customers away.

## [Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over "heroes"](https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/)
**Score:** 361 | **Comments:** 368 | **ID:** 46719222

> **Article:** This article, based on a quote from Douglas Adams, explores the cultural divide between English and American storytelling, particularly regarding the concept of a "hero." Adams posits that American heroes are defined by competence, autonomy, and a clear purpose; they are individuals who take charge and succeed. In contrast, English heroes are often reluctant, bumbling, and defined by their struggle against a system they cannot control. The English find humor and pathos in this failure and absurdity, whereas the American tradition prefers to celebrate success and mastery. Adams uses the example of a car in a ditch to illustrate this: the American hero gets out and fixes the problem, while the English hero is stuck, complaining about the absurdity of the situation. The article frames this as a fundamental difference in worldview, where American culture celebrates the individual who overcomes, and English culture finds a wry humor in the individual who is overwhelmed.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates Adams' observation, with users exploring its nuances and offering counterpoints. Many commenters, particularly those from the UK, strongly agree, citing the difficulty they have relating to traditional American humor and heroism. The comparison between the UK and US versions of "The Office" is frequently mentioned as a perfect real-world example: the UK version's bleak, failure-focused narrative versus the US version's more optimistic and ultimately warmer tone.

However, the conversation also complicates the binary. Some users point to modern American shows like *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*, which feature terrible people facing comeuppance, as being more British in spirit and more relatable. A significant counterargument is raised regarding "lovable loser" characters in American media, such as Charlie Brown, who seem to fit the English archetype. A rebuttal to this suggests that Americans often view Charlie Brown not as a sympathetic hero but as a figure of contempt whose failure is deserved, reinforcing the original thesis.

The discussion also broadens the scope beyond comedy. Users note that this cultural difference is visible in "maker" communities on YouTube, where American creators often display a British-style self-deprecation. The conversation touches on whether popular British YA fiction like *Harry Potter* is an exception to the rule, with some arguing its success in the US is due to its "American-style" hero's journey, while others attribute its success to marketing and the "exotic" nature of its British setting. Ultimately, many users caution against over-generalizing two diverse cultures, but the core observation is seen as a valuable lens for understanding cultural products.

## [Why does SSH send 100 packets per keystroke?](https://eieio.games/blog/ssh-sends-100-packets-per-keystroke/)
**Score:** 328 | **Comments:** 213 | **ID:** 46723990

> **Article:** The article investigates why SSH sends approximately 100 packets for every keystroke when used for a terminal-based game. The author discovers that this is due to SSH's keystroke timing obfuscation feature, designed to prevent traffic analysis attacks where an adversary could infer what is being typed based on packet timing. This feature sends "chaff" (dummy) packets to mask the real timing of user input. While crucial for security in standard terminal sessions, this behavior introduces significant overhead and latency, which is problematic for the author's high-performance game. The author details their process of debugging the issue and ultimately modifying the Go SSH library to disable this obfuscation for their specific use case where security is not a primary concern.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News covers several key themes. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the author's unconventional choice to build a high-performance game over SSH, with some commenters expressing disbelief ("WAT") while others defend the creative challenge and the convenience of using a standard SSH client. Technical solutions to the packet overhead were proposed, with `TCP_CORK` being highlighted as a method to coalesce packets without the latency penalty of disabling `TCP_NODELAY`.

Security was another major topic. Commenters strongly cautioned against disabling SSH's keystroke obfuscation in production environments, noting that it was implemented to fix a real-world vulnerability. However, this was countered by the argument that for the author's specific game, the security trade-off was acceptable and explicitly explained in the article.

Finally, there was a meta-discussion about the article's writing style, with several users noting that the author's use of an AI assistant (likely Claude) was apparent from overused phrases like "smoking gun" and corporate-style language. The author (eieio) engaged in the comments, explaining that the "obtuseness" and solving difficult, unconventional problems is a core part of their work's appeal.

## [It looks like the status/need-triage label was removed](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/16728)
**Score:** 277 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46721179

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the `google-gemini/gemini-cli` repository where an automated bot, `gemini-cli[bot]`, became stuck in an infinite loop. The bot repeatedly added and removed the `status/need-triage` label from the issue, generating over 4,600 comments and actions in a short period before the issue was locked. The incident highlights a failure in the automation logic where the bot reacted to its own actions without a mechanism to detect or prevent the loop.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the absurdity of the situation, the technical failures involved, and the broader implications of AI automation.

Commenters expressed amusement and disappointment at the "stupidity" of the future, with many noting the irony of advanced AI being used for such a trivial and wasteful loop. Several users drew parallels to classic software engineering bugs, such as email notification loops in CRM systems (Salesforce) or the lack of basic loop detection in automation scripts.

Technical analysis centered on why the bot failed. Users debated whether this was a "classic CI bug" or a specific failure of the LLM's reasoning. One user pointed out that LLMs lack a sense of self or memory, meaning the bot likely did not recognize its own previous actions, treating them as external events. Others noted that the responses appeared "perfectly canned," suggesting the issue might stem from rigid CI rules rather than the LLM's generative capabilities.

There was significant concern regarding the operational costs and noise generated by the incident. Users calculated that the loop likely generated tens of thousands of email notifications for subscribers. Furthermore, commenters questioned who was paying for the inference costs of these repeated API calls, noting that the repository appears to be maintained by a random user rather than an official Google entity, potentially leaving them with a massive bill.

Finally, the discussion touched on the recurring nature of this specific issue within the repository, with one user linking to four other similar incidents, suggesting a systemic lack of safeguards in the `gemini-cli` automation logic.

## [Design Thinking Books (2024)](https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-books/)
**Score:** 275 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46718061

> **Article:** The article is a curated list of recommended books on "Design Thinking" for 2024. It covers foundational texts and modern guides aimed at helping readers apply human-centered, iterative problem-solving methods to innovation and product development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely bypassed the specific book list to debate the value and definition of "Design Thinking" itself. While some users appreciated the list and shared additional book recommendations like "Don't Make Me Think" and "Creative Confidence," the core debate centered on the validity of Design Thinking as a discipline.

A significant portion of the conversation was critical of the concept. One commenter argued that Design Thinking is an oversimplified subset of the more robust "Systems Thinking," suggesting the latter is a more comprehensive approach to problem-solving. Others questioned the term's substance, noting it sounds like "regular good design" and is often used to rebrand design away from purely visual outputs. The academic depth of classic texts was also challenged; a developer found "The Design of Everyday Things" to be overly theoretical and impractical, a sentiment others echoed from past experiences.

The discussion also featured lighter moments, including a joke about the article's title being misinterpreted as "designing books that think" and criticism of the hyperbolic "must-read" language often used in such lists.

## [Doctors in Brazil using tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims (2017)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/brazilian-city-uses-tilapia-fish-skin-treat-burn-victims)
**Score:** 267 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46715600

> **Article:** A 2017 PBS NewsHour article reports on a Brazilian medical innovation using sterilized tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims. The fish skin is processed to remove scales and odor, then applied directly to burns. It acts as a natural bandage that retains moisture, reduces pain, and accelerates healing. The treatment is significantly cheaper than traditional synthetic skin substitutes and avoids the regulatory hurdles of human skin donations. While not yet approved for use in the US due to FDA scrutiny and animal rights concerns, it has shown promising results in Brazil.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the novelty of the treatment, its comparison to conventional medicine, and the cultural references it evokes. Many commenters recognized the technique from medical dramas like *Grey's Anatomy* and *The Good Doctor* (both airing episodes about it around 2017), though others noted that the technique is older than these pop culture depictions.

A significant portion of the debate focused on medical efficacy. While the article highlights the benefits of tilapia skin, some users argued that it might not be superior to standard treatments like silver sulfadiazine, citing studies that show similar results. However, others countered that collagen-rich fish skin offers better patient comfort and mobility, potentially reducing the need for skin grafts.

There was also speculation regarding why the treatment is more widely adopted in Brazil than in the US. Commenters suggested that the FDA's strict regulations on animal-derived medical products and the influence of animal rights groups create high barriers to entry in the American market. Finally, the discussion included humorous cultural references to Frank Herbert's *Dune* and the practical economics of using a byproduct of the tilapia farming industry.

## [Bugs Apple Loves](https://www.bugsappleloves.com)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46727587

> **Article:** The article is a website titled "Bugs Apple Loves," which lists a collection of persistent software bugs and user experience frustrations with Apple products. The list includes issues across macOS, iOS, and Apple's web services, such as Spotlight search freezing, poor mail search functionality, difficulties creating Apple IDs (especially with custom domains), Bluetooth audio stuttering, and Apple Watch unlock failures. The site appears to be a crowdsourced or curated collection of common complaints, presented as a single-page list.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the frustrations listed on the site, with users sharing personal anecdotes of similar bugs. A key theme is the perceived decline in Apple's software quality over time. Several commenters argue that the issue isn't a lack of engineering talent but rather a shift in business priorities; engineers are focused on shipping new features ("10X things") rather than paying down technical debt. One user notes that Apple was once unique for shipping OS updates focused solely on bug fixes (like Snow Leopard), a practice that has largely disappeared.

There is also criticism of Apple's internal processes. One commenter suggests that Apple's release cycle lacks a proper mechanism for prioritizing old bugs, as they are often simply deferred to future releases rather than being actively fixed. The discussion also touches on specific usability pain points, particularly around web services and account creation, with users reporting that Apple's platforms are often hostile to non-standard email addresses or require workarounds (like using the App Store popup instead of the website). The consensus is that while the bugs are frustrating, they are a symptom of a larger organizational focus on new features over polish.

## [30 Years of ReactOS](https://reactos.org/blogs/30yrs-of-ros/)
**Score:** 240 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46716469

> **Article:** The article commemorates the 30th anniversary of ReactOS, an open-source operating system designed to be binary-compatible with Windows applications and drivers. It reflects on the project's long history, its engineering challenges, and its ongoing development as a "clean room" implementation of the Windows NT architecture.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the project's practical relevance, technical challenges, and the impact of modern tools like AI. While commenters universally express admiration for the project's longevity and engineering ambition, the consensus is that its window for mainstream adoption has likely passed.

Key themes include:
*   **Practical Alternatives:** Many argue that Wine/Proton running on Linux has become the more viable solution for running Windows software, especially for gaming, as it offers a path away from the Windows ecosystem entirely. Others note that for niche hardware driver support, ReactOS remains a unique proposition, but one with a limited audience.
*   **The "Engineering Exercise" vs. "Usable Product":** A recurring sentiment is that ReactOS has evolved from a potential Windows replacement into a valuable but largely academic exercise in kernel development and reverse engineering, similar to projects like GNU Hurd. While impressive, it's seen as too slow to keep pace with modern hardware and software.
*   **The AI and Legal Minefield:** A significant thread discusses the potential of AI (like agentic coding) to accelerate development. However, this is quickly countered by the project's strict legal requirements. To maintain its "clean room" status and avoid copyright infringement lawsuits from Microsoft, all contributors must affirm they have never seen leaked Windows source code. Since AI models may have been trained on such leaks, accepting AI-generated code poses a major legal risk that could undermine the entire project.
*   **The "Windows Effect":** One commenter highlights the irony that even open-source projects often end up reinforcing Windows' dominance, citing the cross-platform reliability of the proprietary NTFS filesystem as an example where open-source alternatives have failed to gain similar traction.

## [Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers](https://lambdaland.org/posts/2026-01-21_tree-sitter_vs_lsp/)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 58 | **ID:** 46719899

> **Article:** The article "Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers" compares two technologies used in modern code editors. Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool that creates fast, error-tolerant parsers, primarily used for syntax highlighting and structural code analysis. Language Servers, operating via the Language Server Protocol (LSP), provide a broader suite of IDE features like autocompletion, go-to-definition, and diagnostics by communicating with a dedicated language server process. The author concludes that while Tree-sitter excels at low-latency parsing and is ideal for custom languages or lightweight highlighting, Language Servers offer deep semantic understanding necessary for complex code intelligence, and the two technologies are often used together rather than as strict alternatives.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News provided a nuanced expansion on the article's points, with several key themes emerging. A central topic was the practical application and ecosystem of Tree-sitter, with users debating the availability of parsers for various languages and clarifying that third-party packages often fill the gaps not covered by official distributions.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on performance and the division of labor between the two technologies. Commenters, including a developer from the Roslyn (C#) team, elaborated on the performance characteristics of parsing, noting that modern incremental parsers can achieve microsecond speeds. The consensus was that an ideal editor setup uses Tree-sitter for immediate, low-latency syntax highlighting on the main thread, while the LSP asynchronously handles more computationally expensive semantic analysis and features, preventing UI sluggishness.

The discussion also highlighted the distinct capabilities of each tool. While Tree-sitter is praised for its speed and ease of use in creating parsers for new languages, LSPs were noted as superior for semantic tasks. A key example was semantic syntax highlighting, where an LSP can differentiate between a mutable and an immutable variable, providing more context than a purely syntactic parser. Finally, the conversation touched on practical concerns like tool development (refactoring) and technical challenges such as managing binary size when distributing multiple Tree-sitter grammars.

## [Capital One to acquire Brex for $5.15B](https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/capital-one-buy-fintech-firm-brex-515-billion-deal-2026-01-22/)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46725288

> **Article:** Capital One is acquiring the fintech company Brex for $5.15 billion. This represents a significant decrease from Brex's peak valuation of $12.3 billion in 2021, though the company has reportedly grown its revenue substantially since then. The deal is seen as a strategic move for Capital One to expand its business customer portfolio with Brex's infrastructure and client base.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely views this acquisition as a "haircut" deal, reflecting the cooling of the fintech market after the "zero interest-rate policy" (ZIRP) era. The dominant sentiment is that while the price is steep for Capital One, it is a particularly tough outcome for Brex employees and late-stage investors who invested at the $12 billion valuation peak.

Key discussion points include:
*   **Valuation and Financials:** Commenters note the 50% discount from Brex's peak valuation. Some argue the deal is fair given Brex's reported revenue growth, suggesting Capital One is acquiring an asset growing at 50% YoY for roughly 7x revenue. However, others question why investors would accept this price if the growth was truly that strong.
*   **Employee vs. Investor Impact:** A major theme is the disparity in outcomes between investors and employees. Users clarify that investors with 1x liquidation preferences likely got their money back, breaking even. In contrast, employees holding options or RSUs from recent high-valuation rounds are likely taking a significant financial loss ("taking a haircut" or being "fucked").
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Brex is seen as having lost its early leadership position to competitors like Ramp, which is praised for a higher development pace and successful pivot to AI. The discussion suggests Brex waited too long to exit while growth stalled.
*   **Strategic Rationale:** The acquisition is viewed as a strategic win for Capital One, allowing them to acquire a customer base and infrastructure at a reasonable price. There is debate over whether Capital One will integrate Brex fully or maintain it as an autonomous unit, with some noting Capital One has a history of keeping acquired businesses separate.

## [Macron says €300B in EU savings sent to the US every year will be invested in EU](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qjtvtl/macron_says_300_billion_in_european_savings_flown/)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 184 | **ID:** 46722594

> **Article:** French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announced a major policy shift regarding European capital. He stated that the approximately €300 billion in European savings that are currently invested in the United States annually will be redirected and invested within the European Union instead. The goal is to create a more competitive European financial market and retain capital domestically to fuel growth and innovation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Macron's announcement was largely skeptical and critical, with commenters questioning the feasibility and underlying causes of the capital flight.

A primary theme was skepticism about the economic viability of the plan. Several users argued that capital flows to where returns are highest, and unless the EU fundamentally improves its investment opportunities and growth policies, simply wishing for capital to stay will not work. One commenter pointed out a flaw in Macron's logic regarding exchange rates, noting that for capital to leave the Eurozone, it must be exchanged with someone coming in the opposite direction, suggesting the problem isn't a simple one-way outflow.

Another major thread focused on the structural and bureaucratic hurdles within the EU. Commenters cited the EU's long-standing failure to finalize a trade deal with Mercosur as evidence that such a significant financial restructuring would be an extremely slow process, if it happens at all. There was also a recurring suggestion that the EU could easily attract capital by lowering barriers, specifically by reducing capital gains taxes on investments.

The discussion also touched on the cultural and behavioral differences in saving between Europe and the US. Citing statistics showing a much higher personal savings rate in the EU (18.79%) compared to the US (3.50%), European commenters expressed surprise at the American "paycheck to paycheck" lifestyle, while others debated whether the EU figures included mandatory pension contributions.

Finally, the conversation included some off-topic but popular comments, such as speculation about Macron's sunglasses (an eye infection), a joke about Paul Graham's influence, and a debate on whether the US is currently pro- or anti-free trade.

## [CSS Optical Illusions](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68091/css-optical-illusions)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46722570

> **Article:** The article "CSS Optical Illusions" by Alvaro Montoro showcases a collection of visual illusions created purely with CSS. The author demonstrates how modern CSS features like gradients, transforms, and animations can be used to replicate well-known perceptual tricks, such as the Hermann grid, scintillating grid, and motion aftereffect. The piece serves as both a creative demonstration of CSS's capabilities and an educational resource on how to implement these specific visual effects in web design.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was generally positive, with users expressing admiration for the technical creativity and finding the examples visually interesting. A key point of conversation was the practical application of these effects; while some users were inspired to use them in their own UIs, others noted that similar effects often appear unintentionally and can mess up user interfaces if not used carefully.

Several commenters delved into the technical and scientific aspects of the illusions. One thread clarified that the CodePen previews needed to be interacted with to be fully appreciated, as static images didn't capture the effect. Another user provided a detailed analysis of the "appearing dots" illusions, identifying them by their scientific names (McAnany's and Ninio's types) and linking to academic sources and their own recreations. Other notable comments included a user sharing their own recreation of the Ames window illusion, a suggestion to use these techniques for CAPTCHAs, and a reminiscence about creating similar effects in older software like Excel.

## [ISO PDF spec is getting Brotli – ~20 % smaller documents with no quality loss](https://pdfa.org/want-to-make-your-pdfs-20-smaller-for-free/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46717507

> **Article:** The article from the PDF Association announces that the ISO PDF specification is being updated to include Brotli compression. The primary benefit cited is a potential ~20% reduction in file size for documents without any loss of quality. The article positions this as a significant, free upgrade for PDF creators and highlights that major open-source libraries like MuPDF and Ghostscript are already implementing support for reading Brotli-compressed PDFs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the decision to adopt Brotli, with several key themes emerging. The most prominent point of contention is the choice of Brotli over Zstandard (zstd). Commenters argue that zstd offers significantly better decompression speeds, which is crucial for a "read-many" format like PDF, and that Brotli's standard dictionary is poorly suited for PDF content, as it was trained on 2015 web data. This choice is frequently attributed to either incompetence or the influence of Google, Brotli's developer.

A second major theme is skepticism about the practical benefits. Several users argue that the 20% size reduction is marginal and largely negated by existing transport-level compression (like HTTP Brotli) or filesystem compression. They contend that the real problem with PDF size is often bloated graphical content, not compression inefficiency.

Finally, there is significant concern about the change's impact on the PDF ecosystem. Commenters point out the irony of the PDF Association's "must work seamlessly with existing readers" principle, as this is a breaking change that will render new documents unreadable by older software. This will lead to a long and fragmented adoption period. The discussion also touched on a cynical view that the change is a "pay-to-play" effort by a commercial entity (iText) to standardize a feature their SDK already supports, potentially creating a competitive advantage.

## [Recent discoveries on the acquisition of the highest levels of human performance](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adt7790)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46722853

> **Article:** The article, "Recent discoveries on the acquisition of the highest levels of human performance," challenges the conventional belief that early specialization is the key to elite achievement. The research indicates that top performers in fields like science, chess, music, and sports often have diverse backgrounds and demonstrate lower-than-peer performance in their specific domain during their early years. The study finds that early exceptional performers and later world-class performers are largely different populations; for instance, nearly 90% of top youth chess players do not become top adult players. The authors argue that a "sampling period" involving broad exploration across different domains is crucial for developing the skills necessary to eventually reach the highest levels of performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the article is multifaceted, with users debating the findings, offering alternative explanations, and sharing personal anecdotes. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on statistical critiques, particularly the application of Berkson's Paradox. Several commenters suggest that the observed negative correlation between early and late performance might be an artifact of selection bias, where one only observes the "best of the best" at each stage, creating a spurious relationship. This statistical debate is central to the discussion, with users linking to visualizations and Wikipedia to explain the paradox.

Another major theme is the tension between early specialization and broad exploration. Many commenters share personal stories or observations that align with the article's thesis, noting that the "smartest" or most creative adults often had varied interests in their youth, while those who excelled through intense, narrow focus from a young age sometimes "crashed out" or plateaued. This connects to the idea that cross-domain knowledge helps avoid "local maxima" and fosters creativity.

The discussion also touches on systemic and societal implications. One user points out that despite the evidence for diverse paths, many prestigious career paths (academia, elite sports) still heavily reward early, specialized achievement, potentially filtering out late bloomers. The role of innate ability versus disciplined effort is also debated, with some commenters arguing that consistent work eventually surpasses raw talent, especially when the latter leads to complacency.

Finally, there are several side discussions, including a debate on the validity of a secondary source, a comparison to David Epstein's book *Range*, and a correction on the popular conflation of ADHD with "hyperfocus," with a user clarifying that this is a misrepresentation of the medical condition and not a path to elite performance.

## [White House Posts Digitally Altered Image of Woman Arrested After ICE Protest](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/22/white-house-ice-protest-arrest-altered-image)
**Score:** 111 | **Comments:** 16 | **ID:** 46725268

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports that the White House digitally altered an image of a woman arrested after an ICE protest, likely using a generative AI model. When asked about the alteration, the White House did not directly answer but instead shared a post from Deputy Communications Director Kaelan Dorr on X (formerly Twitter). The post mocked the defense of "perpetrators of heinous crimes" and stated that "the memes will continue." The article highlights the government's fabrication of a contemporaneous image of an arrestee, the official response via a social media post rather than a statement, and the parody of Trump's tweet style.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses significant alarm and criticism regarding the White House's actions. Commenters view the digitally altered image and the official response as evidence of a breakdown in social order and a disregard for truth and due process. Key themes include the normalization of government fabrication, the erosion of constitutional rights, and the stylistic imitation of Trump's communication tactics. One user drew parallels to political corruption in South Africa, while others questioned the severity of the alleged crime and the nature of the church-state separation issue raised in the article. The conversation also briefly touched on the technical aspect of which AI provider might have been used.
