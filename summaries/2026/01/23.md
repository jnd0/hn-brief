## [GPTZero finds 100 new hallucinations in NeurIPS 2025 accepted papers](https://gptzero.me/news/neurips/)
**Score:** 651 | **Comments:** 356 | **ID:** 46720395

> **Article:** The article from GPTZero, an AI detection service, reports finding 100 instances of AI-generated "hallucinations" (fabricated references, data, or text) within papers accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 conference. The findings highlight a growing concern that researchers are using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate scientific content, including fake citations to non-existent authors like "John Doe" and "Jane Smith," which are slipping through the peer review process undetected. The article serves as an alarm bell regarding the integrity of scientific publishing in the age of generative AI.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses significant alarm and dismay over the report, viewing it as a symptom of a decaying scientific review process. The consensus is that this phenomenon harms scientific research and erodes trust. Key themes include:

*   **Erosion of Scientific Integrity:** Commenters are disturbed that peer review failed to catch obvious fabrications, with some suggesting that reviewers may also be using LLMs. There is a strong sentiment that making up data or references constitutes fraud that should be punished severely.
*   **Systemic Failures in Peer Review:** Several users, including current reviewers, explained that the volume of submissions (e.g., NeurIPS receiving 20,000 papers) makes it impossible to verify every reference. They argue that the academic system relies on a "trust but verify" model that is breaking down under the weight of high publication demands and the ease of generating plausible-sounding nonsense.
*   **Skepticism of AI Detectors:** A recurring counterpoint is skepticism toward GPTZero's methodology. Users questioned the "base rate"—how many pre-2020 papers would be flagged as AI-generated?—and noted that human error and reference fabrication existed before LLMs, though likely at a lower volume.
*   **Cultural Issues in Academia:** Several commenters argued that "AI slop" is merely accelerating existing problems in AI/ML research, which they describe as prioritizing optics, funding, and posturing over substance ("fake it and never make it").
*   **Proposed Solutions:** Suggestions for mitigation included requiring reproducible code (a "PoC or GTFO" approach) and shifting the focus of scientific journalism to emphasize reproducible results rather than initial claims.

## [Show HN: isometric.nyc – giant isometric pixel art map of NYC](https://cannoneyed.com/isometric-nyc/)
**Score:** 563 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46721802

> **Project:** The project is an interactive, giant isometric pixel art map of New York City, created by a developer using generative AI (specifically Gemini). The creator wrote a detailed technical blog post explaining the process, which involved using AI to generate the assets and automate parts of the workflow. The site faced initial availability issues due to being "hugged to death" by Hacker News traffic but was later restored.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the philosophical implications of using AI in creative projects. The creator's writeup sparked a debate about the value of AI-generated art, with one commenter expressing concern that the technology devalues human craft and creates an imbalance in the artistic ecosystem. The creator responded by acknowledging the dual nature of AI—excitement for new possibilities mixed with worry for obsolete crafts—and framed the project as a demonstration of how AI shifts the differentiator from technical skill to "love" and intent.

Other themes included:
*   **Technical Appreciation:** Users praised the detailed process documentation and the visual result.
*   **Requests for Expansion:** Several commenters requested similar maps for other major cities like San Francisco, Tokyo, and Paris.
*   **Counterpoints on Scale:** A debate emerged regarding the necessity of AI for such large projects, with users citing examples like a physical miniature model of NYC or a 1:1 scale Minecraft recreation to argue that human labor can achieve similar feats, albeit with different constraints.
*   **Technical Issues:** Initial site downtime and CORS/rate-limiting errors were noted, though the creator confirmed the site was back online shortly after.

## [In Europe, wind and solar overtake fossil fuels](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels)
**Score:** 452 | **Comments:** 482 | **ID:** 46719491

> **Article:** A Yale e360 article reports that in 2024, wind and solar power generated more electricity in Europe than fossil fuels for the first time. The analysis shows renewables produced 30% of the EU's electricity, while fossil fuels (coal, gas, and oil) dropped to 29%. This milestone is attributed to a decade of steady growth in renewable capacity, accelerated recently by the energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While the shift is significant for the power sector, the article notes that fossil fuels still dominate total energy consumption, which includes transport and heating.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the geopolitical implications of Europe's energy transition, the economic costs versus benefits, and the technical challenges of scaling renewables.

A major theme was the geopolitical landscape, specifically China's relationship with Russia and Europe. Commenters debated whether China would pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine to protect its export market in Europe. The consensus, however, was that China benefits more from Russia's self-isolation and economic decline, which makes Russia a dependent supplier of cheap resources. Furthermore, a prolonged war in Ukraine distracts the West, giving China more freedom to pursue its own strategic goals, such as its territorial claims in the South China Sea and ambitions regarding Taiwan.

The economic debate was polarized. Some commenters argued that Europe's high electricity costs are crippling its industries and making it less competitive compared to the US and China. They contended that consumers would prefer lower prices over "clean energy." Conversely, others countered that high European prices are partly due to a lack of domestic fossil fuel reserves and that investing in renewables is crucial for long-term energy independence and security. A personal anecdote from a Canadian user highlighted the financial viability of rooftop solar, noting it was a "no brainer" thanks to grants and long-term savings.

Finally, the discussion addressed technical aspects of the energy transition. Several users pointed out that the article's data only covers electricity generation, not total energy consumption, which is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for transport and heating. However, others noted that electrification through EVs and heat pumps is progressing. The intermittency of renewables was raised as a challenge, but commenters were optimistic about solutions like battery storage, which is already beginning to displace natural gas during peak hours, and heat pumps, which are highly efficient and can be paired with cheap thermal storage.

## [Qwen3-TTS family is now open sourced: Voice design, clone, and generation](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3tts-0115)
**Score:** 438 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46719229

> **Article:** Alibaba's Qwen team has open-sourced the Qwen3-TTS family, a suite of models for text-to-speech, voice design, and voice cloning. The release includes models of varying sizes (0.6B to 1800M parameters) and capabilities, such as cross-lingual voice cloning, allowing a voice to speak in different languages. The announcement includes a blog post with audio samples demonstrating the technology's quality and realism.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of technical curiosity, awe at the technology's quality, and significant ethical concern. The most prominent observation across multiple comment threads was the distinct "anime-like" or "YouTuber" quality of the English voice samples, leading to speculation that the model may have been trained heavily on such content.

Technically, users discussed the practicalities of running the models locally. While some provided resources like Hugging Face demos and a custom CLI tool, others noted challenges with installation, particularly on non-NVIDIA hardware like Macs, though workarounds were suggested. The size of the models (ranging from 100M to 1800M parameters) was also a point of comparison against smaller alternatives like Pocket TTS.

The quality of the voice cloning was described as "uncanny" and "terrifying." Users were amazed by its potential for creative projects, such as restoring old radio plays or creating personalized audio content. However, this capability also sparked serious concerns about misuse, with commenters warning that the technology makes it easy to create convincing deepfakes for scams or misinformation, reinforcing the need to treat digital media with extreme skepticism. The discussion also briefly touched on broader AI politics and a desire for more competition in coding models.

## [Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections](https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/)
**Score:** 426 | **Comments:** 480 | **ID:** 46713924

> **Article:** The article argues that internet voting is fundamentally insecure and should not be used in public elections. It is authored by a group of computer security experts and academics, and it is presented as a statement signed by numerous security researchers. The core argument is that the security properties required for trustworthy elections (such as voter privacy, coercion resistance, and verifiable results) cannot be guaranteed over the internet, regardless of the cryptographic technology used. The authors contend that internet voting introduces significant risks, including the potential for large-scale tampering by malicious actors, vulnerabilities in client-side software (e.g., malware on voter devices), and the difficulty of conducting meaningful audits. The article concludes that paper-based systems, despite their own limitations, remain the most secure and auditable method for conducting elections.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely aligns with the article's conclusion, expressing broad skepticism toward internet voting and a preference for paper-based systems. The consensus is that the security risks of internet voting are too high and that the trust and verifiability offered by paper ballots are paramount.

Many commenters pointed to existing, successful paper-based voting systems as the ideal model. One user described Australia's system, which uses paper ballots, compulsory attendance, and machine-assisted counting with robust human oversight, arguing that it "just works" and maintains high public trust. This prompted a side discussion about the specifics of Australian voting, such as the use of pencils (which some found concerning) and comparisons to India's well-regarded election process.

A recurring theme was the trade-off between efficiency and security. Several users argued that the primary goal of elections is trust, not speed or convenience. They expressed concern that moves toward electronic and internet voting have already eroded public trust and that further adoption would worsen this, making it easier for malicious actors to compromise results at scale. The idea of "going back" to paper was supported by multiple commenters as a way to make attacks more difficult.

The discussion also touched upon the challenges of implementing secure digital systems. One commenter suggested that a government-managed cryptographic token system could be a solution, but this was immediately countered by concerns about privacy and coercion—namely, that verifiable links between a voter and their ballot would enable vote-buying or intimidation. The practical difficulties of managing such digital identities were also highlighted.

A few comments offered alternative perspectives. One user questioned whether improved efficiency from electronic methods could increase voter turnout, while another drew a distinction between the requirements for anonymous voting (internet voting) and reversible financial transactions (internet money), suggesting they are fundamentally different problems. The conversation also included a meta-commentary on the timing of the discussion, with one user speculating that the initial, uniformly anti-internet-voting comments might later be drowned out by "propaganda," though this was quickly challenged.

## [Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over "heroes"](https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/)
**Score:** 303 | **Comments:** 326 | **ID:** 46719222

> **Article:** The linked article recounts an anecdote from Douglas Adams about the cultural difference between American and British storytelling, specifically regarding "heroes." Adams observed that American heroes are defined by their competence, autonomy, and ability to overcome obstacles to achieve a clear goal. In contrast, British heroes are often reluctant, bumbling, and defined by their struggle against systems or circumstances they cannot control, with the humor arising from their inevitable failure or resignation. The article frames this as a fundamental difference in worldview: the American belief in the individual's power to effect change versus the British acceptance of life's inherent absurdity and limitations.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates Adams' observation, with users expanding on the cultural divide through various media examples. Many commenters, particularly those from the UK, express relief at the articulation of a feeling they've long held, noting that American humor often feels too optimistic or success-oriented. Conversely, some American users note their appreciation for British humor (like Monty Python) but acknowledge a generational shift where modern American comedy (e.g., *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*) has adopted more British-style cynicism and "cringe" humor where characters are losers rather than heroes.

Several threads analyze specific examples to test the theory. *The Office* is cited as a prime example: the UK version is bleak and grounded in failure, while the US version is warmer, sunnier, and allows for character growth and optimism. The discussion also touches on literature, with users debating whether protagonists in *Harry Potter* or *Lord of the Rings* fit the American or British mold. While some argue these characters are competent heroes, others counter that figures like Frodo are reluctant and defined by their burden rather than a desire for mastery.

Counterpoints are raised regarding American media's embrace of failure, specifically citing Charlie Brown as a beloved "lovable loser" archetype. However, other users argue that Americans often view Charlie Brown with contempt rather than sympathy, seeing his failures as a result of personal weakness rather than systemic bad luck. The conversation concludes with a reminder that these are broad generalizations and that both cultures possess diverse narratives, though the core distinction between the "competent hero" and the "reluctant participant" remains a resonant framework for analyzing cultural output.

## [I was banned from Claude for scaffolding a Claude.md file?](https://hugodaniel.com/posts/claude-code-banned-me/)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46723384

> **Article:** The article details the author's experience of being banned from Anthropic's Claude Code service without warning or clear explanation. The author speculates that the ban may have been triggered by their process of "scaffolding" a `CLAUDE.md` file, which involved a multi-agent workflow where multiple Claude instances were interacting with and potentially updating each other's control files. The author notes that while Anthropic refunded their subscription, they received no communication from support regarding the reason for the ban, leaving them to guess at the cause.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the lack of recourse and support from AI companies, the confusion surrounding the author's specific actions, and the broader implications for AI service providers.

Many commenters expressed frustration with the opacity of AI moderation and the absence of customer support from companies like Anthropic. Several users shared personal anecdotes of being banned without cause or explanation, which led them to favor local LLMs for their reliability and independence from corporate whims. A common sentiment was that while companies have the right to ban users, doing so without communication damages trust and pushes potential customers away.

There was significant confusion about the technical details of the author's workflow. Some readers struggled to understand the blog post's narrative, while others speculated that the author's circular, multi-agent process (where Claude instances might be updating each other's control files) could have been misinterpreted by Anthropic's safety systems as a prompt injection attack. However, it was also pointed out that the author was merely guessing about the reason for the ban, as no official reason was provided.

A notable sub-thread discussed the missed opportunity for AI companies to use their own technology for customer support. One commenter argued that Anthropic's failure to implement an AI-powered support system is a strategic risk, as it undermines confidence in the reliability of their AI for business applications. Others countered that the technology may not yet be trusted for such sensitive tasks, and that Anthropic's focus remains on coding capabilities.

Ultimately, the discussion reinforced a broader theme of skepticism towards relying on closed, hosted AI services for critical work, with many advocating for self-hosted solutions to maintain control and avoid arbitrary disruptions.

## [Threat actors expand abuse of Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://www.jamf.com/blog/threat-actors-expand-abuse-of-visual-studio-code/)
**Score:** 273 | **Comments:** 277 | **ID:** 46713526

> **Article:** The article from Jamf details how threat actors are increasingly abusing Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) features to execute malicious code. The primary attack vector involves embedding malicious configurations within a project's `.vscode` folder, particularly in `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files. When a developer opens a folder in VS Code and grants trust to the repository, the editor can automatically process these files. Attackers can name malicious tasks to appear legitimate (e.g., "Build," "Run," "node"), which, when executed by the user, run arbitrary commands on the host system. The article also notes that VS Code's "Workspace Trust" feature, designed to prevent this, can be bypassed by social engineering, and that extensions can also be a source of malicious activity.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the security implications of modern development tools, the reasons for VS Code's popularity, and potential solutions.

A significant portion of the debate revolved around the fundamental security model of VS Code. Commenters expressed alarm that a text editor could execute code simply by opening a folder, comparing the risk to historical threats like macro-enabled Office documents and `autorun.inf` files. While some pointed out that VS Code does prompt for trust, others argued that users will almost always click "trust" to avoid friction, making the feature an insufficient safeguard. The core issue was identified as the convenience-vs-security trade-off, where the ease of use for tasks and debugging creates a large attack surface.

The conversation also branched into a comparison of VS Code with other editors. When one user questioned why VS Code is the de facto standard over Eclipse, a common sentiment emerged: VS Code is seen as "good enough" for most languages and tasks, whereas Eclipse is heavily associated with Java. This led to a broader discussion on the architecture of modern apps. Some users criticized VS Code's foundation in web technologies (Electron) for creating a large attack surface and expressed a preference for JVM-based IDEs like JetBrains, believing them to be more secure. However, others countered that any IDE that automatically executes build scripts (like Gradle) is equally vulnerable, regardless of its underlying technology.

Finally, the discussion explored potential solutions. The consensus was that developers should work in isolated environments. Many suggested that developing inside containers should be the default workflow to protect the host machine. However, it was noted that this doesn't solve the problem of compromised credentials or a backdoored application being deployed. The conversation also touched on other editor choices, like Zed, but a commenter quickly pointed out that Zed also had its own security-related issues in its default configuration, highlighting that this is a widespread problem across the industry.

## [Significant US farm losses persist, despite federal assistance](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/significant-farm-losses-persist-despite-federal-assistance)
**Score:** 269 | **Comments:** 383 | **ID:** 46713929

> **Article:** The article from the American Farm Bureau Federation (a major US agricultural lobbying group) argues that despite federal assistance, US farms are experiencing significant and persistent financial losses. It likely attributes these losses to a combination of factors including low commodity prices, high input costs (fuel, fertilizer, equipment), and global market disruptions. The piece serves as a call to action, emphasizing that current support measures are insufficient to ensure the long-term viability of the farming sector and urging for continued or expanded policy intervention to protect farm incomes and national food security.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on US farm losses is multifaceted, blending political analysis, economic theory, and structural critiques of the agricultural industry.

A dominant theme is political, with users debating the voting patterns of farmers. Several commenters express frustration that farmers overwhelmingly supported the Trump administration, whose policies (such as tariffs on China) are seen as directly contributing to the economic pain in the agricultural sector, particularly through the collapse of soybean exports. There's a cynical view that voters are prone to blaming external enemies rather than recognizing self-inflicted harm, a tendency the current Republican party is accused of exploiting.

Economically, the discussion centers on the justification for farm subsidies. Users offer several reasons beyond simple economics: the political power of the farming vote (especially in the Electoral College), national security concerns regarding food independence, and the consumer desire for stable, cheap food prices. This is contrasted with a counter-argument favoring deregulation, citing New Zealand's experience as a case where removing subsidies led to a more innovative and resilient agricultural sector in the long run.

Finally, a significant portion of the conversation focuses on the structural problems within the industry. The core issue is identified not as farmer inefficiency but as a lack of market power. Farmers are described as being squeezed between monopolistic suppliers of seeds and machinery (like John Deere and Bayer/Monsanto) and monopsonistic buyers who set prices. Commenters argue that subsidies often end up enriching these large corporations rather than helping farmers. The discussion also touches on the tension between large-scale industrial farming, which is seen as more economically efficient, and the romanticized but often struggling small family farm. The Canadian "Supply Management" system is presented as an alternative model that prioritizes price stability and farmer profitability over pure market forces, though it is not without its own flaws.

## [It looks like the status/need-triage label was removed](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/16728)
**Score:** 269 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46721179

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue in the `google-gemini/gemini-cli` repository where an automated bot, `gemini-cli`, got stuck in a feedback loop. The bot repeatedly added and removed the `status/need-triage` label from the issue, generating thousands of comments and actions over a short period. The issue highlights a failure in the automation logic, where the bot's actions triggered its own response rules, creating an infinite loop.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the absurdity and implications of the automated loop, with users analyzing the technical and financial fallout. A key point of analysis was the scale of the incident: one user noted the issue log indicated "4609 remaining items," suggesting the bot performed thousands of actions, likely generating tens of thousands of email notifications for subscribers. This led to speculation about the cost of the inference calls, with users questioning who was paying for the repeated API requests, especially since the project appears to be an unofficial or third-party application.

Commenters debated the nature of the bug. While one user labeled it a "classic CI bug," others pushed back, arguing that a bot failing to recognize its own actions and getting stuck in a loop is a distinct failure mode. The conversation frequently referenced a similar incident from the previous week involving the same repository, establishing a pattern of recurring issues with this specific automation. The discussion also branched into analogies, with one user sharing a story about a poorly configured Salesforce automation that created a similar email loop, while another used a viral video to humorously illustrate the gap between a developer's intent and the automation's actual behavior. Ultimately, the tone was a mix of humor and concern, with users lamenting the "stupidity" of the future while also recognizing the practical (if unintentional) utility of stress-testing systems at scale.

## [Design Thinking Books (2024)](https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-books/)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46718061

> **Article:** The article "Design Thinking Books (2024)" from Designorate.com provides a curated list of recommended books on the topic of design thinking. It categorizes the books into sections such as "Design Thinking Foundations," "User Experience and Interaction Design," "Creativity and Innovation," and "Systems and Strategic Design." The list includes well-known titles like *The Design of Everyday Things*, *Creative Confidence*, and *Sprint*, aiming to offer a comprehensive reading guide for designers, innovators, and business leaders looking to apply design thinking methodologies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of appreciation for the book list and significant debate over the nature and value of "Design Thinking" itself. While several users thanked the original poster or shared additional book recommendations (such as *Don't Make Me Think*, *Creative Confidence*, and *The Design of Design*), the conversation quickly pivoted to deeper critiques.

A central theme was the perceived gap between theory and practice. One user found *The Design of Everyday Things*—often hailed as a design bible—to be overly academic and impractical, a sentiment that sparked a side discussion about more hands-on resources like *Refactoring UI*. Another user criticized the article's list as lacking taste, consisting merely of popular, minimalist titles.

The most substantive debate centered on the validity of "Design Thinking" as a discipline. Critics argued that it is an oversimplified, branded subset of the more robust and holistic field of "Systems Thinking." They contended that while Design Thinking is easy to market and apply, Systems Thinking offers a more fundamental and powerful approach to complex problems. Proponents of Design Thinking defended it as a pragmatic, operational framework for product development, contrasting it with the abstract and difficult-to-implement nature of Systems Theory. The discussion also touched on the definition of Design Thinking, with some viewing it as simply a rebranding of good design principles, while others saw it as a necessary codification of a process that balances user needs, technical feasibility, and business viability.

## [Doctors in Brazil using tilapia fish skin to treat burn victims (2017)](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/brazilian-city-uses-tilapia-fish-skin-treat-burn-victims)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46715600

> **Article:** A 2017 PBS NewsHour article reports on a medical technique in Brazil where sterilized tilapia fish skin is used to treat second and third-degree burn victims. The fish skin is processed to remove scales and fats, then sterilized and applied directly to burns. It acts as a natural biological dressing that retains moisture, reduces pain, and minimizes the need for antibiotics and painkillers. The treatment is significantly cheaper than traditional methods, as the skin is a byproduct of the food industry. While the article notes that US regulations make it unlikely for this method to be adopted in American hospitals soon, it highlights the technique's effectiveness and cost-efficiency in Brazil.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around three themes: pop culture references, the validity and history of the medical technique, and the regulatory differences between countries.

Many commenters immediately recognized the treatment from popular TV shows, specifically mentioning episodes of *Grey's Anatomy* and *The Good Doctor* that featured the method. While some used this to label the news as "old," others defended its relevance regardless of its novelty.

The medical validity of the treatment was debated. Some commenters expressed skepticism, suggesting the benefits might be similar to placebo or standard treatments like silver sulfadiazine. However, others countered with evidence that collagen-based dressings (which fish skin is rich in) can aid healing and reduce the need for skin grafts. A veterinarian also shared anecdotal success using the technique on cats.

Finally, there was a discussion on why the method isn't used in the US. Commenters noted that while the FDA is strict, the primary barriers are likely cost and the availability of donated human skin, rather than a lack of efficacy. The conversation also touched on the economic benefits of using a cheap byproduct from the massive tilapia farming industry.

## [30 Years of ReactOS](https://reactos.org/blogs/30yrs-of-ros/)
**Score:** 232 | **Comments:** 137 | **ID:** 46716469

> **Article:** The article from the ReactOS project blog celebrates the project's 30th anniversary. It reflects on the long journey of developing an open-source, Windows-compatible operating system from scratch. The post acknowledges the immense technical challenge and the slow, steady progress made over three decades, emphasizing the project's commitment to its original goal of providing a free alternative to Windows with binary compatibility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of admiration for the project's longevity and a pragmatic assessment of its current relevance. The dominant theme is that while ReactOS is a remarkable engineering achievement, its practical window for mainstream adoption may have closed.

Many commenters compare ReactOS to Wine/Proton, which have made significant strides in running Windows applications on Linux, particularly for gaming. The consensus is that Wine has become the more practical solution for most users, as it leverages the mature and widely supported Linux ecosystem. ReactOS's unique potential value is in driver compatibility, but it's seen as lagging far behind modern hardware needs.

The conversation also touches on the project's challenges and future. Funding and corporate sponsorship are mentioned as potential hurdles. A significant point of debate arises around the use of AI (like Claude) for development. While some suggest it could accelerate progress, others raise a critical legal and philosophical objection: ReactOS contributors must legally affirm they have never seen Microsoft's proprietary source code. Since AI models may have been trained on leaked Windows code, accepting AI-generated patches could jeopardize the project's "clean room" implementation status and expose it to copyright lawsuits.

Overall, the community views ReactOS with a mix of respect for its dedicated developers and a sense that it has become more of a pure "engineering exercise" or a "hobby project"—a testament to reverse-engineering skill rather than a viable alternative for modern computing.

## [Why does SSH send 100 packets per keystroke?](https://eieio.games/blog/ssh-sends-100-packets-per-keystroke/)
**Score:** 225 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46723990

> **Article:** The article investigates why SSH sends an unusually high number of packets (around 100) for every single keystroke. The author, who is building a high-performance game over SSH, initially suspected their own code or network settings. Through debugging and analysis, they discovered the root cause is a security feature in OpenSSH designed to prevent keystroke timing attacks. This feature works by sending "chaff" (dummy) packets alongside real data to obfuscate the timing patterns of user input. While crucial for security in terminal sessions, this behavior creates significant overhead and latency for the author's real-time application, leading them to patch the Go SSH library to disable this feature for their specific use case where security is less of a concern than performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical and philosophical implications of the article's findings. A primary theme was the trade-off between security and performance. While several commenters strongly advised against disabling the keystroke obfuscation feature in production environments due to the real-world threat of timing attacks, others acknowledged that for the author's specific, non-sensitive game application, the performance trade-off was justified.

Technical solutions were a major focus. Commenters suggested using `TCP_CORK` or disabling `TCP_NODELAY` as alternative methods to reduce packet count, though the author noted these might not fully solve the latency issues for their real-time game. The feasibility of using UDP-based protocols like QUIC or specialized libraries (e.g., GameNetworkingSockets) instead of SSH was also debated, with the general consensus being that while technically superior for games, using SSH was an intentional choice for its "obtuseness" and the fun of solving an unconventional problem.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader topics. There was a meta-conversation about the overuse of AI-generated writing tropes, with several users pointing out that phrases like "smoking gun" and "brutal truth" are common giveaways for content assisted by models like Claude. The performance of the SSH implementation itself was questioned, with one user finding its CPU usage for packet processing surprisingly high, though others countered that the overhead of encryption was a significant factor.

## [Tree-sitter vs. Language Servers](https://lambdaland.org/posts/2026-01-21_tree-sitter_vs_lsp/)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46719899

> **Article:** The article compares Tree-sitter and Language Server Protocol (LSP) for code editing features. It clarifies that they are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Tree-sitter is a fast, incremental parser generator that provides immediate syntax highlighting and structural analysis, making it ideal for local, responsive editor features. LSP is a protocol for communication between an editor and a language server, which provides deep, semantic understanding of code (e.g., type information, cross-file references). The author suggests using Tree-sitter for fast, syntax-based tasks like highlighting and structural editing, while leveraging LSP for slower, semantic tasks like autocompletion and go-to-definition. The article also notes that some LSPs use Tree-sitter internally for parsing.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise, emphasizing that Tree-sitter and LSP are complementary tools that serve different purposes. A key theme is performance and user experience. Commenters explain that Tree-sitter's speed and synchronous parsing are crucial for instant, flicker-free syntax highlighting, while LSP-based highlighting can introduce latency. The ideal approach, used by many modern editors, is to combine both: use Tree-sitter for fast, initial syntax highlighting and LSP for slower, semantic coloration (e.g., distinguishing mutable vs. immutable variables in Rust).

Another major point addresses the scope of each tool. While the article focuses on editing, commenters highlight their use in other domains. Tree-sitter is praised for its utility in developing new programming languages and building custom refactoring tools, where its error tolerance and speed are major advantages. LSP is recognized for providing rich, semantic information that syntax-only parsers cannot, such as resolving ambiguous function calls based on scope.

Several comments clarify practical details. One user corrected the misconception that a lack of official packages for a language means no Tree-sitter support exists, pointing to third-party libraries. A Roslyn architect provided a detailed technical perspective, noting that high-performance LSPs use incremental parsing and multi-threaded architectures to achieve microsecond latencies, ensuring the editor remains responsive. The discussion also touched on the importance of human-written content versus AI-generated articles, with commenters agreeing that the act of writing is a crucial part of distilling and clarifying thought.

## [Macron says €300B in EU savings sent to the US every year will be invested in EU](https://old.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1qjtvtl/macron_says_300_billion_in_european_savings_flown/)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46722594

> **Article:** French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announced a major policy shift to retain and attract capital within the European Union. He stated that the €300 billion in European savings currently invested in the United States annually will be redirected to fund investments within the EU. This initiative is part of a broader effort to create a "savings and investments union" in Europe, aiming to make the region more financially competitive and reduce capital flight to the US markets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Macron's announcement was largely skeptical and multifaceted. The core sentiment was disbelief in the feasibility of the proposal, with many commenters arguing that capital will naturally flow to where it earns the highest returns. Critics contended that the EU's regulatory environment and lack of profitable investment opportunities are the root causes of capital flight, and that Macron's statement is political rhetoric rather than a viable economic plan.

Several distinct themes emerged from the conversation:
*   **Economic Feasibility:** Many users questioned the numbers and the mechanics of the proposal. One commenter argued that under a floating exchange rate, capital outflows require corresponding inflows, suggesting the premise is flawed. The general consensus was that without fundamental policy changes, such as deregulation or lower taxes, the EU cannot simply "decide" to retain capital.
*   **Political Context:** A common viewpoint was that Macron's statement is less about actual policy and more aimed at international audiences, particularly Donald Trump and the US, as a form of political posturing. The discussion frequently referenced the US's own shifting trade policies, adding a layer of geopolitical complexity.
*   **EU Structural Issues:** Broader frustrations with the EU's economic performance and bureaucratic slowness were prominent. Commenters cited the EU's inability to finalize major trade deals (like Mercosur) as evidence of its structural inefficiency, making Macron's ambitious goal seem even more unrealistic.
*   **Comparison of Savings Culture:** A sub-thread compared EU and US personal savings rates, noting the EU's significantly higher rate. This led to discussions about the different financial realities and consumer habits on either side of the Atlantic, though it was also noted that high savings don't automatically translate to attractive domestic investment opportunities.
*   **Tangents and Humor:** As is typical for HN, the discussion included tangents. These ranged from a humorous debate about Paul Graham's influence on European venture capital to a clarification on why Macron was wearing sunglasses in the referenced video (an eye infection).

## [ISO PDF spec is getting Brotli – ~20 % smaller documents with no quality loss](https://pdfa.org/want-to-make-your-pdfs-20-smaller-for-free/)
**Score:** 138 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46717507

> **Article:** The article from the PDF Association announces that Brotli compression is being added to the ISO PDF specification. It claims this will allow for approximately 20% smaller PDF documents without any quality loss. The article highlights that this is a non-breaking change for existing readers (they will simply ignore the new compression filter) and notes that major open-source libraries like MuPDF and Ghostscript are already implementing support. It also mentions that the PDF Association is experimenting with custom dictionaries for further optimization but is currently using the standard Brotli dictionary.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the decision to adopt Brotli, focusing on three main themes: the choice of algorithm, the practical impact on compatibility, and the perceived motives behind the change.

A dominant sentiment is that Brotli is the wrong choice compared to Zstandard (zstd). Commenters argue that zstd offers significantly faster decompression speeds, which is crucial for a "read-many" format like PDF, and that Brotli's standard dictionary is ill-suited for PDF content, having been trained on 2015 web data. The choice is attributed by some to either incompetence or Google's influence, with many stating zstd is the superior general-purpose algorithm.

There is significant skepticism regarding the claim that this is a "non-breaking change." While existing readers might ignore the new compression filter, documents created with Brotli compression will be unreadable by any viewer that doesn't yet support it. This creates a long adoption period where compatibility is uncertain, undermining the format's reliability.

Finally, several users question the fundamental need for this feature. They argue that transport-level compression (like HTTP's Brotli) and filesystem compression are more efficient and flexible, as they allow the end-user to choose the algorithm. The discussion also includes skepticism about the article's quality, with some labeling it as "AI slop," and a counterpoint that Brotli's compression ratio might still be better than zstd's in some cases, despite the speed trade-off.

## [CSS Optical Illusions](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/68091/css-optical-illusions)
**Score:** 122 | **Comments:** 12 | **ID:** 46722570

> **Article:** The article "CSS Optical Illusions" by Alvaro Montoro showcases a collection of visual illusions created purely with CSS. The post demonstrates how modern CSS features like gradients, shadows, and transforms can be used to replicate well-known psychological effects, such as the Hermann grid, motion aftereffects, and color adaptation. The examples serve as both a technical demonstration of CSS capabilities and an exploration of visual perception.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the technical execution of the illusions, though some users offered critical perspectives on their nature. Several commenters noted that these effects are not just novelties but often appear unintentionally in UI development, causing visual artifacts or confusion. A technical point was raised regarding the visibility of the examples; one user clarified that the CodePen previews appear dark by default and must be actively run to be seen correctly.

The conversation also delved into the psychology of the illusions. One user expressed that they could consciously override most of the illusions except for the induced gradients, while another pointed out a specific rotational illusion (the "color fan") that works best in peripheral vision. The discussion became more academic when a user identified the specific scientific names for the "appearing dots" illusions—McAnany's and Ninio's types—and provided links to the original research by Akiyoshi Kitaoka. Finally, the applications of these techniques were debated, with suggestions ranging from using them in UI design to creating novel CAPTCHAs.

## [Ubisoft cancels six games including Prince of Persia and closes studios](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6200g826d2o)
**Score:** 93 | **Comments:** 87 | **ID:** 46721452

> **Article:** Ubisoft is canceling six games, including a remake of *Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time*, and closing two studios in response to financial struggles. The company plans to pivot its focus toward developing open-world adventure games and live-service titles. The article notes that Ubisoft's stock price has dropped significantly over the past year, reflecting investor concerns about the company's direction and performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on Ubisoft's strategic failures, the challenges of game development, and corporate accountability. Commenters express disappointment over the cancellation of the *Prince of Persia* remake, noting it had progressed far enough to receive an ESRB rating. Many criticize Ubisoft's reliance on remakes and remasters, arguing that the company is failing to innovate and is instead milking existing IPs with microtransactions. The conversation highlights skepticism about Ubisoft's pivot to live-service games, with users pointing out that this is the same strategy that led to their current financial troubles.

There is significant debate about the difficulty of game remakes versus remasters, with some arguing that a remake should be straightforward while others cite examples like the *System Shock* remake to show it's a complex undertaking. The closure of a recently unionized studio draws criticism, with commenters accusing Ubisoft of blaming rising development costs (i.e., worker wages) to justify layoffs while ignoring executive pay and corporate waste. Financial analysis of Ubisoft's stock performance is also discussed, with users noting a severe long-term decline. Finally, there is a sense of resignation regarding other long-awaited projects like *Beyond Good and Evil 2*, which many believe was doomed to be a generic live-service game rather than a true sequel.
