## [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
**Score:** 2247 | **Comments:** 947 | **ID:** 46579864

> **Article:** The article "The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe" argues that recent macOS versions (specifically the hypothetical "Tahoe" release) have degraded the user experience of window management, particularly resizing. The author notes that resizing has become unreliable, with a noticeable delay between initiating a drag and the window actually moving, and the resize "hitboxes" being too small or unresponsive. The piece connects these specific frustrations to a broader trend: Apple's increasing prioritization of iOS design principles over established Mac usability conventions. The author laments that the Mac's unique interface traits are being "surgically altered" to look younger like iOS, resulting in a "weird" and less functional desktop experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely validates the article's complaints, with many users expressing long-standing frustration with macOS window management. A recurring theme is that Apple's window resizing has historically been poor, citing the old limitation of only resizing from the bottom-right corner and the lack of clear visual cues (frames) for resizing areas. Users compare the current "jankiness" of macOS Tahoe to the perceived flaws of Windows Vista or 2000s-era Linux, ironically noting that Linux now often provides a more refined and consistent desktop UX. Several commenters express that these UI regressions are a primary reason they are refusing to upgrade their OS. However, there is a counter-current of users who have largely abandoned manual resizing in favor of keyboard shortcuts or third-party window management tools (like Rectangle), suggesting that Apple's native implementation is bypassed by power users.

## [Statement from Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm)
**Score:** 689 | **Comments:** 582 | **ID:** 46582420

> **Article:** Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a statement addressing a criminal investigation initiated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against him. Powell revealed that the DOJ had subpoenaed the Federal Reserve and threatened criminal indictment. He framed this as a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve's refusal to bow to political pressure regarding interest rate policy. Powell asserted that the central bank must remain independent and make decisions based on economic data and the public good, rather than following the preferences of the President. He characterized the legal threat as an unprecedented attempt to undermine the Fed's autonomy and intimidate its leadership.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion expresses widespread alarm and a strong consensus that the event represents a dangerous erosion of democratic norms and institutional independence. Commentators describe the situation as "crazy," "unprecedented," and reminiscent of a "banana republic." There is a clear sentiment that the checks and balances of government are failing, with users noting that Congress appears passive while the executive branch aggressively targets independent agencies.

The discussion focuses heavily on the political motivations behind the DOJ's action, specifically attributing it to President Trump's desire for lower interest rates. Users argue that this is not just about monetary policy but part of a broader pattern of authoritarian behavior, where the President seeks absolute authority and retaliates against anyone who stands in his way. While there is some debate about the validity of Powell's past economic policies, the overwhelming majority of commenters expressed "major respect" and "courage" for his decision to stand up to the pressure. The prevailing mood is one of deep concern regarding the stability of US institutions and the rule of law.

## [CLI agents make self-hosting on a home server easier and fun](https://fulghum.io/self-hosting)
**Score:** 665 | **Comments:** 451 | **ID:** 46580326

> **Article:** The article argues that a combination of new technologies—specifically affordable, powerful hardware (like mini PCs), AI CLI agents (like Claude Code), and secure networking tools (like Tailscale)—has made self-hosting a home server significantly easier and more accessible. It positions these tools as "unlocks" that lower the barrier to entry for non-experts. The author provides a practical guide on how to set up a home server using these tools, demonstrating how an AI agent can assist with typical sysadmin tasks like configuring services, managing Docker containers, and troubleshooting, thereby turning what was once a complex chore into a fun and rewarding hobby.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely agrees with the article's premise, identifying Tailscale and AI assistants as key enablers for the modern self-hosting movement. The discussion highlights several key themes:

A major consensus is that **Tailscale is the most significant "unlock."** Multiple commenters, including the top-voted one, argue that it solves the biggest historical barrier to self-hosting: security. By creating a secure, private mesh network without exposing ports to the internet, Tailscale makes it safe and simple to access home services from anywhere, which dramatically increases their usability.

The role of **AI agents like Claude Code is seen as a powerful but secondary enabler.** While many commenters acknowledge its value in automating tedious Linux administration (e.g., writing systemd services, Ansible scripts) and saving hours of work, some experienced users express skepticism. They argue that the "fun" of self-hosting comes from understanding the system yourself and worry about the risks of ceding control of critical infrastructure to an AI.

The conversation also touched on practical considerations:
*   **Hardware & Cost:** Commenters noted that modern mini PCs are extremely power-efficient, making the electricity cost negligible and addressing concerns about running a server 24/7.
*   **Security Best Practices:** One commenter raised a valid concern about the security of self-hosting a password manager (Vaultwarden), suggesting it requires a higher level of isolation than other services.
*   **Alternative Tools:** Other easy-to-use platforms like Cloudron were mentioned as options for those who want an even more managed experience.

## [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader)
**Score:** 565 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46578921

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source command-line tool called "iCloud Photos Downloader" on GitHub. The tool is designed to download a user's entire photo and video library from iCloud, addressing a perceived gap in Apple's official offerings. It appeals to users who want a local backup of their media or wish to migrate away from the Apple ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the difficulty of bulk-downloading photos from iCloud and the motivations behind this tool. A primary theme is the debate over whether Apple intentionally makes data export difficult to lock users into its ecosystem. Many users confirm this, sharing personal frustrations with the native Photos app crashing during large exports and expressing a desire for a reliable, automated backup solution they control. The tool is praised by long-term users as a stable solution for nightly backups.

Conversely, other users point out official, albeit imperfect, methods for data retrieval. These include using the "Download and Keep Originals" setting on Apple devices, requesting a full data archive from privacy.apple.com, or using the direct data transfer tool to move photos to Google Photos. However, the community's sentiment leans towards the official methods being slow, cumbersome, or unreliable, reinforcing the need for third-party tools. A minor point of discussion involves a user's technical issue with video thumbnails, and another comment raises a security concern about the potential for such a popular tool to be targeted by malicious actors.

## [Anthropic: Developing a Claude Code competitor using Claude Code is banned](https://twitter.com/SIGKITTEN/status/2009697031422652461)
**Score:** 302 | **Comments:** 162 | **ID:** 46578701

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet claiming that Anthropic's Terms of Service (ToS) ban users from developing a competitor to "Claude Code" using the Claude Code tool itself. The tweet highlights a specific clause in the ToS that prohibits using the service to create a competing product. This is framed as Anthropic preventing developers from using their own AI tools to build better or alternative AI tools, sparking a debate on the ethics and practicality of such restrictions in the AI industry.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a nuanced debate, moving from initial outrage to a more technical and cynical understanding of the situation. The community's reaction can be broken down into three main themes:

First, there is a significant divide on the interpretation of the ToS. Some users, like `ctoth` and `mcintyre1994`, argue that the "outrage bait" is misleading. They suggest the rule is likely intended to prevent reverse-engineering the OAuth API to bypass the paid "Claude Code" subscription and use it as a cheap API replacement, rather than to stop someone from building a new IDE from scratch. They point out that Anthropic actively encourages building on their official API.

Second, a more cynical and philosophical thread emerges, with users like `akomtu` and `mystraline` viewing this as standard corporate behavior. They argue that the entire AI industry is built on massive IP theft, so it's hypocritical for these companies to now enforce strict rules to protect their own "moats." The sentiment is that "might makes right" and the powerful will always legislate to block upstarts.

Finally, there is a practical discussion about the effectiveness of such a ban and the competitive landscape. Users like `viraptor` and `fgonzag` argue that a ToS is a flimsy barrier that won't stop determined competitors, especially large corporations. Furthermore, they contend that Anthropic's moat isn't as strong as they think, pointing to the rise of capable open-source alternatives like Opencode and the ability for developers to build their own multi-model workflows, which could make users less likely to return to a locked-down ecosystem.

## [Xfce is great](https://rubenerd.com/xfce-is-great/)
**Score:** 279 | **Comments:** 209 | **ID:** 46584173

> **Article:** The article "Xfce is great" is a short, enthusiastic endorsement of the Xfce desktop environment (DE). The author praises it for being lightweight, stable, and fast, contrasting it with more resource-heavy DEs like GNOME and KDE. The core argument is that Xfce respects the user's workflow by staying out of the way, offering a traditional and highly customizable desktop experience without unnecessary bloat or constant UI changes. It is presented as a reliable and efficient choice for getting work done.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely agrees with the article's sentiment, celebrating Xfce for its speed, stability, and minimalism. A recurring theme is the "perceived latency" or "click lag" of modern operating systems and desktop environments, with several users noting that Xfce feels significantly snappier and more responsive, even on powerful hardware. This responsiveness is attributed to its lightweight nature and simple architecture.

The primary counterpoint is that Xfce's traditional, "old-fashioned" look and feel might be off-putting to new Linux users, who might be better served by more polished and modern defaults in GNOME or KDE. This leads to a debate on whether Xfce's modularity is a performance liability in the modern Wayland era, where integrated compositors are argued to be more efficient. However, this technical critique is largely dismissed by long-time users who value the flexibility and "un-opinionated" nature of Xfce's design far more than potential performance gains they don't personally notice.

Other key points include:
*   **Alternatives:** LXQt is frequently mentioned as a comparable lightweight alternative.
*   **Customization:** While some find the default appearance "ugly," others point to the vast customization possibilities and showcase examples from the "unixporn" community.
*   **Use Cases:** Xfce is highly recommended for older hardware, VNC setups, and systems with NVIDIA GPUs where it is perceived to have fewer driver-related issues.
*   **Nostalgia & Philosophy:** The discussion touches on Xfce's history, its philosophical similarity to the classic Windows XP interface, and a broader frustration with the constant, often superficial, UI changes in commercial operating systems.

## [Meta announces nuclear energy projects](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/01/meta-nuclear-energy-projects-power-american-ai-leadership/)
**Score:** 263 | **Comments:** 311 | **ID:** 46578497

> **Article:** Meta has announced a series of projects to secure nuclear energy for its US operations, aiming to power its growing AI infrastructure. The initiative is framed as a commitment to sustainable energy and a strategic move to support American leadership in AI. The announcement highlights Meta's goal of adding over 1.1 GW of new nuclear energy capacity to the grid, partnering with existing energy providers like Vistra.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Meta's nuclear energy announcement is multifaceted, with users expressing a mix of skepticism, economic analysis, and debate over energy policy.

A significant portion of the comments are cynical about Meta's motives. Several users doubt the company's commitment to sustainability, viewing the move as a self-serving necessity to power its energy-intensive AI datacenters rather than a genuine effort to benefit society. One commenter sarcastically noted that this won't improve customer service, while another argued that Meta is simply privatizing a public resource, which could drive up energy prices for everyone else.

The conversation also delves into the broader economics of energy. A key point of debate is whether nuclear is the best path forward. One user argued that renewables and storage are now cheaper and more scalable, making nuclear an increasingly obsolete and expensive option, especially for consumers. This was countered by another who felt that any investment in new energy capacity is a net positive for the country, regardless of the corporate actor behind it.

Finally, there were practical concerns about the project's execution. Some commenters questioned whether Meta's partners could deliver, drawing parallels to other high-profile tech failures, while others clarified that the deal primarily involves purchasing power from existing nuclear facilities rather than building new ones. The discussion also touched on broader economic anxieties, with users connecting high energy costs to the rising price of housing and other goods, suggesting a system designed to keep consumers locked in.

## [This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser](https://iczelia.net/posts/snake-polyglot/)
**Score:** 263 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46580864

> **Article:** The article by "Iczelia" details the creation of a Snake game that is a single 13 KiB polyglot file. This file functions as:
1.  A **DOS .COM executable** (via a shell script loader).
2.  A **Linux executable** (using a shell script to decompress and run an embedded binary).
3.  An **HTML/JavaScript file** for the browser (using a CDATA section to hide the binary payload from the browser's parser while allowing a JS loader to extract and run it).

The technical implementation relies on shell script "trampolines" and specific file offsets to ensure the file is interpreted correctly by each operating system's respective loader without modification.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with admiration for the technical cleverness of the file, while also engaging in practical troubleshooting and historical comparisons.

**Technical Implementation & Issues**
Several users tested the file across different environments. While the browser version worked simply by renaming the file to `.html`, the Linux and Windows versions required specific conditions:
*   **Linux:** Users noted that running the file directly failed if the `xz` package wasn't installed to handle decompression. Others found that the file triggered Mono (C# runtime) by default, requiring explicit execution via `bash snake.com`.
*   **Windows:** A user encountered a memory access error (`0xc0000005`) which was resolved by disabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP), a security feature that can block this type of self-modifying or non-standard executable code.

**Historical Context & Comparisons**
Commenters placed the project in the context of "size-coding" and historical software:
*   **Polyglot History:** Users discussed the origins of polyglot files, citing the EICAR antivirus test file as an early example of a COM/Text hybrid.
*   **Size Comparisons:** The 13 KiB size was compared to the original *The Legend of Zelda* (128 KiB) and the 96 KiB demo scene game *kkrieger* (a 3D first-person shooter).
*   **Modern Efficiency:** There was a consensus that while such feats were possible decades ago, modern tools and browser capabilities open up new possibilities for single-file applications.

**Future Applications**
Users discussed the utility of single-file, cross-platform apps. One suggested a "polyglot installer" approach where a user downloads an HTML file that uses JavaScript to offer a download of itself as a binary executable. Others lamented that modern browser security restrictions (like the lack of File System API access in non-HTTPS contexts) hinder the full potential of local single-file apps.

## [The next two years of software engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/next-two-years/)
**Score:** 240 | **Comments:** 247 | **ID:** 46580703

> **Article:** The article "The next two years of software engineering" by Addy Osmani (a Google engineer) argues that the role of the software engineer is fundamentally shifting from a "coder" to an "AI-augmented problem solver." The core thesis is that AI tools (like Cursor, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI) are rapidly automating the act of writing code, which devalues raw syntax knowledge and increases the value of high-level engineering skills.

Key predictions and advice include:
*   **The "AI-Augmented" Engineer:** The most valuable engineers will be those who can leverage AI to multiply their output. The author suggests that one junior developer proficient with AI could soon match the output of a small team.
*   **Focus on Fundamentals:** As coding becomes more automated, the differentiating skills will be system design, problem decomposition, domain knowledge, and communication. Engineers must understand and verify every line of AI-generated code, not just "vibe code."
*   **Advice for Juniors:** New developers must become "immediately useful" by mastering AI tools and building a portfolio of AI-integrated projects. They should be versatile and consider adjacent roles (QA, DevRel) as entry points.
*   **Education Shift:** The author suggests that traditional CS degrees may need to evolve to include more practical, modern skills like DevOps and cloud computing, rather than focusing solely on theory.

In essence, the article is a call to action for engineers to embrace AI as a powerful collaborator to handle the "drudgery" of coding, freeing them up to focus on architectural and strategic challenges.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and skeptical, with many commenters challenging the article's premise, the author's credibility, and the practical reality of AI in software development.

A central theme is the debate over the value of experience versus AI proficiency. While the article suggests a flattening of seniority, many commenters argue that true seniority is defined by architectural taste, system design, and the ability to manage complexity—skills that are more critical than ever when dealing with AI-generated code. One commenter used the analogy of an e-bike: AI allows unskilled developers to move fast, but without fundamental skills, they are more likely to crash and accumulate "entropy."

The discussion on junior developers was particularly contentious. Several users found the article's advice to "just become an AI expert" to be out of touch, arguing that the primary issue is a lack of hiring opportunities, not a lack of effort from juniors. The sentiment that "we are all juniors now" was countered by the view that the gap between competent and incompetent developers will widen, with AI amplifying the mistakes of the latter.

Skepticism about the author's perspective was rampant. As a Google engineer working on Gemini, his optimistic view of AI's capabilities was seen by some as biased marketing rather than a grounded industry analysis. This led to broader criticism of "AI hype" and the disconnect between vendor narratives and the day-to-day reality of most developers.

Finally, many users shared their own experiences, which contrasted with the article's more futuristic claims. They described LLMs not as autonomous agents that replace engineers, but as "better Google" or "autocomplete on steroids"—tools that speed up lookups and syntax generation but still require a human architect to direct the work. They argued that the "vibe coding" narrative is a strawman that distracts from more useful discussions about how to effectively integrate these tools into existing workflows.

## [Poison Fountain](https://rnsaffn.com/poison3/)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 131 | **ID:** 46577464

> **Article:** The article "Poison Fountain" proposes a method for content creators to "poison" their data against AI models. The technique involves using a tool that dynamically generates subtle, human-readable variations of text (e.g., replacing words with synonyms, altering phrasing) that are undetectable to humans but alter the model's output in undesirable ways. The goal is to create a "DRM for data," making it so that AI companies that scrape content without permission or payment are training their models on corrupted data, while licensed users receive the clean, original version. It is framed as a defensive measure for artists and writers to protect their work from unauthorized use by large AI labs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on "Poison Fountain" was highly polarized, centering on the feasibility, ethics, and potential consequences of such a technique.

A major theme was the debate over whether this is an effective attack or a futile gesture. Skeptics argued that major AI labs have vast resources to mitigate such threats, for instance by using LLMs to detect poisoning or by relying more on post-training reinforcement learning (RL) rather than just pre-training data. However, proponents countered that poisoning could still increase the cost of data curation and that detection is not guaranteed, especially if the poisoning is subtle and dynamic.

Many commenters drew parallels to existing issues. Some likened it to the "crap filtering" and SEO spam wars described in Neal Stephenson's *Anathem*, where poisoning the information ecosystem becomes a business model. Others saw it as a direct response to AI companies scraping the web without compensation, viewing it as a form of digital rights management or protest.

There was significant discussion about the potential negative consequences. One prominent argument was that this tactic would primarily harm open-source AI efforts, as large corporations with proprietary data moats would be insulated from the effects. This could lead to a "rug pull," where big tech companies, having already harvested the clean internet, poison the well for everyone else. Another concern was that it would simply make models more unstable and unsafe for everyone, without stopping AI development.

Finally, the discussion included a notable personal attack, where one user was called out for a "psychotic" and abusive comment directed at another user, highlighting the toxicity that can arise in heated online debates.

## [BYD's cheapest electric cars to have Lidar self-driving tech](https://thedriven.io/2026/01/11/byds-cheapest-electric-cars-to-have-lidar-self-driving-tech/)
**Score:** 216 | **Comments:** 275 | **ID:** 46579927

> **Article:** An article from The Driven reports that BYD will equip its cheapest electric vehicles, such as the Atto 1 (sold as the Seagull in China), with LiDAR technology for self-driving capabilities. The article highlights the aggressive pricing of these vehicles, noting that the Atto 1 is available for around AUD $24,000 in Australia and as low as $16,000 USD equivalent in China. This move is framed as a significant disruption, bringing advanced driver-assist features to the budget segment and challenging established automakers, particularly in Western markets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive about BYD's strategy, viewing it as a major disruption to the automotive industry. The consensus is that BYD's vertical integration and scale allow them to offer advanced technology at a price point that Western manufacturers cannot match. Commenters believe US carmakers are "cooked" and that protectionist tariffs are the only thing preventing a flood of affordable, feature-rich Chinese EVs into the American market.

The core technical debate revolves around the merits of LiDAR versus a camera-only (vision) approach, famously championed by Tesla. The majority of commenters argue that LiDAR is now becoming cheap enough that it is "insane" to choose vision-only. They point to the dramatic cost reduction of LiDAR sensors and the fact that camera-based systems are becoming more expensive due to competition with AI for GPU resources. Elon Musk's decision to forgo LiDAR is widely characterized as a significant, ill-timed mistake.

However, there is some skepticism and counterpoint:
*   **Safety Concerns:** One commenter raised a speculative but alarming concern about the potential for long-term, untracked public health issues, such as retinal damage to pedestrians from LiDAR sensors, drawing parallels to past tech industry irresponsibility.
*   **Design and Aesthetics:** The prominent roof-mounted LiDAR sensor on some models is noted as potentially off-putting to style-conscious buyers, though others compare it to the iPhone's "notch," suggesting consumers will adapt.
*   **Volvo's Reversal:** A link to an article about Volvo dropping LiDAR was shared, with a follow-up comment suggesting their specific implementation was causing issues with other people's camera sensors.
*   **Practical Implementation:** A question was raised about how to train models using LiDAR when human drivers don't use it, with replies explaining that data can be collected and labeled in simulations or from real-world drives for ML training.

Overall, the discussion portrays BYD's move as a game-changing application of a maturing technology, solidifying its cost-effectiveness and putting immense pressure on legacy and Western EV manufacturers.

## [Ozempic reduced grocery spending by an average of 5.3% in the US](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy)
**Score:** 209 | **Comments:** 304 | **ID:** 46587536

> **Article:** A Cornell University study analyzing retail data found that US households using GLP-1 medications (like Ozempic) reduced their grocery spending by an average of 5.3% within six months of starting the drug. The spending reduction was driven by significant decreases in purchases of savory snacks, sweets, baked goods, and alcohol. Conversely, spending on yogurt, fresh fruit, nutrition bars, and meat snacks increased. The study also noted that spending at fast-food and limited-service restaurants fell by about 8%.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the scope of the study, the specific dietary shifts observed, and the broader socioeconomic context of GLP-1 usage. Many commenters emphasized that the 5.3% reduction applies only to households using the medication, not the entire US population, and noted that the savings (estimated at $30–$100 monthly) are modest compared to the drug's high cost.

Key themes included:
*   **Dietary Mechanics:** Users suggested that the shift toward yogurt and fruit is likely driven by a need for increased protein and probiotics to manage digestion side effects (like slowed gastric emptying) caused by the drugs.
*   **Socioeconomic Factors:** There was a debate regarding the high adoption rate in the US compared to Europe, with users attributing this to the poor quality of processed foods in the US and a social stigma in Europe that views the drugs as "cheating."
*   **Conflicting Data:** A counterpoint was raised citing a Bloomberg report suggesting GLP-1 users actually spend *more* dining out, potentially indicating that the grocery savings are offset by higher restaurant bills or that the demographic using these drugs has higher disposable income.
*   **Industry Dynamics:** Some commenters predicted that the food industry would eventually adapt by engineering products that bypass the drugs' appetite-suppressing effects, while others discussed the potential for lobbying battles between the pharmaceutical and food industries.

## [Sampling at negative temperature](https://cavendishlabs.org/blog/negative-temperature/)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46579374

> **Article:** The article from Cavendish Labs explores the concept of "negative temperature" in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) sampling. It explains that the standard softmax function used to convert model logits into probabilities can be generalized to include a temperature parameter (T). While T > 0 is standard (with T=0 being deterministic and T→∞ being uniform random), the author demonstrates that mathematically, T < 0 is also possible.

At negative temperatures, the sampling behavior inverts: the model becomes deterministic again as T approaches 0 from the negative side, but it selects the *least likely* tokens instead of the most likely ones. As the negative temperature moves further from zero (e.g., T=-1, -10), the distribution becomes "anti-softmax," favoring tokens with the lowest logits. The author shows that sampling at T=-1 produces gibberish, while sampling at T=-0.0001 produces "anomalous" tokens that are often semantically empty or represent the geometric center of the embedding space, effectively revealing the model's "anti-knowledge."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the theoretical validity of negative temperature, its relationship to physics, and its practical utility in AI.

Several users with physics backgrounds debated the analogy. While the original article treats negative temperature as a mathematical trick on the softmax function, one user noted that in thermodynamics (specifically spin systems), negative temperature represents a state of population inversion where entropy decreases as energy increases. However, others argued that this physical concept is only superficially related to LLM sampling, noting that negative temperature makes no sense in Molecular Dynamics simulations.

Regarding practical application, the consensus was that negative temperature sampling produces nonsensical output. A user (Der_Einzige, author of the "min_p" sampling method) argued that the field misunderstands temperature limits and that exploring these extremes is valuable engineering. However, another user countered that the "least likely" tokens selected at negative T are often just numerical noise or the geometric center of the embedding space, rather than meaningful opposites of high-probability tokens.

The discussion also touched on evaluation challenges, with users noting that comparing sampling methods is difficult without expensive human evaluation. There was also speculation on using high temperatures to explore different reasoning paths or dynamically adjusting temperature during generation to balance creativity and coherence.

## [FUSE is All You Need – Giving agents access to anything via filesystems](https://jakobemmerling.de/posts/fuse-is-all-you-need/)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46580136

> **Article:** The article "FUSE is All You Need" proposes using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to create virtual filesystems as a universal interface for AI agents to interact with non-file-based data and services. The author argues that since LLMs are heavily trained on CLI and filesystem operations, presenting data like database records, emails, or API objects as files and directories makes them immediately useful without needing to learn new, custom APIs. This approach abstracts away the underlying complexity, allowing agents to use familiar tools like `ls`, `grep`, and `cat` to manipulate data from various sources. The author also suggests this could be a key differentiator for sandboxing providers, who could offer this functionality as a simple, powerful API.

## [I'd tell you a UDP joke…](https://www.codepuns.com/post/805294580859879424/i-would-tell-you-a-udp-joke-but-you-might-not-get)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46580946

> **Article:** The article is a link to a post on the website "codepuns.com" containing a classic networking pun: "I'd tell you a UDP joke… but you might not get it." The humor relies on the properties of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is a "connectionless" protocol that does not guarantee delivery or order of data packets.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a rapid-fire thread of networking-related puns and jokes, largely expanding on the theme of the original post. The conversation flows through several layers of technical humor:

*   **ICMP and Transport Layer Jokes:** Users immediately build on the UDP premise with jokes about other protocols. An "ICMP joke" is presented as a "Knock Knock" joke that doesn't finish ("Who's there? - Thank you"), and a "ping" is suggested as a way to hear a joke. The concept of a "TTL" (Time To Live) is used to explain why an echo request might fail.
*   **Packet Ordering Humor:** A user notes that a comment was "out of order," mimicking UDP's lack of guaranteed delivery sequence. This is followed by a clever joke where a user writes "packets udp bar walk a into," which the next user notes their brain automatically rearranged into the correct sentence, mirroring the joke's content.
*   **Protocol-Specific Puns:** The thread includes a variety of other protocol puns, such as a "shout" that fails to create an "echo," and a reference to the "TCP three-way handshake" in a "Knock Knock" joke format.
*   **Related "Fact" Genres:** One user broadens the topic to include other genres of programming humor, such as "Jon Skeet facts," "Chuck Norris facts," and "Bruce Schneier facts," linking to external collections.
*   **The "Two Kinds of People" Trope:** A user invokes the classic "There are two kinds of people..." setup, leaving the punchline open for others, which is a common format for tech jokes (e.g., "those who understand binary and those who don't").
*   **A Collection of Jokes:** A user laments losing a large collection of similar protocol-based jokes, prompting another to share a link to a text file containing a long list of them.

The overall tone is lighthearted and demonstrates a strong shared knowledge of networking concepts among the commenters.

## [Floppy disks turn out to be the greatest TV remote for kids](https://blog.smartere.dk/2026/01/floppy-disks-the-best-tv-remote-for-kids/)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46587934

> **Article:** The article proposes a novel use for obsolete floppy disks: repurposing them as physical "remotes" for children to control a TV or media player. Instead of storing data, the floppy disk itself acts as a token. A script on a connected computer (like a Raspberry Pi) detects when a floppy is inserted into a drive and then plays the corresponding media file (e.g., a specific cartoon or song). The author argues this system is ideal for kids because it's tactile, simple, and avoids the confusing, ad-filled interfaces of modern smart TVs. It also serves as a clever way to reuse old hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to the idea, with many commenters sharing their own similar projects and appreciating the clever repurposing of old technology. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Broader Applicability:** Several users noted that the concept isn't just for kids; modern TV interfaces are also frustrating for elderly users and even adults due to high latency and complex navigation.
*   **Alternative Implementations:** Many commenters proposed variations on the theme. Some had already built similar systems using RFID cards or stickers (like the commercial Yoto and Tonie players mentioned). Others suggested using other physical media like DVDs or CDs as tokens, which would be cheaper and more readily available than floppy disks.
*   **Nostalgia and Humor:** Users shared nostalgic memories of old hardware (like the Amiga's boot screen) and made jokes about how children would be confused by the "save" icon, which is a representation of a floppy disk.
*   **Technical Details:** A few comments delved into the technical aspects, such as how to detect disk insertion or how to debug old floppy drives, indicating a strong interest in the DIY aspect of the project.

## [Himalayas bare and rocky after reduced winter snowfall, scientists warn](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyndv7zd20o)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46583464

> **Article:** An article from the BBC reports that scientists are observing a worrying trend in the Himalayas: reduced winter snowfall is leaving the mountain range "bare and rocky." This diminished snow cover threatens the water supply for billions of people across Asia who rely on the seasonal meltwater from Himalayan glaciers and snowpack to feed major rivers like the Ganges, Indus, and Yangtze. The article highlights the direct impact of climate change on a critical geographical feature with severe consequences for regional water security, agriculture, and ecosystems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the article is multifaceted, ranging from serious concerns about climate consequences to historical tangents and skepticism.

Several commenters immediately connected the report to broader geopolitical and humanitarian crises. A prominent thread discussed the potential for climate change to trigger mass migrations and conflicts, with users citing the Syrian civil war and ongoing droughts in Iran as examples of climate-related instability. Another user pointed out the catastrophic implications for food security, noting that a third of humanity depends on Himalayan meltwater for agriculture, particularly rice cultivation.

A historical footnote that gained significant traction was the mention of a lost nuclear device on Nanda Devi from a 1960s US-Indian intelligence mission. Commenters debated the potential for the plutonium to contaminate the glaciers that feed the Ganges, though one user questioned the scale of the risk.

The discussion also touched on the nature of the problem and potential solutions. One commenter argued that the primary obstacle for India isn't the climate crisis itself, but a lack of scientific literacy and a political culture that promotes "pre-modern" thinking. This sparked a brief debate about the current Indian government's investment in renewables versus its political rhetoric. Another user expressed a sense of pessimism, suggesting that the world has already passed a tipping point and that only adaptation is now possible.

Finally, the conversation included more speculative and personal points. Some users debated the practical effects on mountaineering (increased rockfall danger, not easier climbing), while others made ironic or hopeful comments about "greening" other regions like Greenland. A linguistic observation noted the sad irony that "Himalaya" literally means "house of snow" in Sanskrit.

## [Uncrossy](https://uncrossy.com/)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46582762

> **Article:** Uncrossy is a web-based puzzle game where players must "uncross" a set of words. The core mechanic involves clicking on a word to make it disappear, which causes the remaining words to shift and merge, forming new words in the process. The ultimate goal is to reduce the initial set of words down to a single, final word. The game is presented as a clean, single-level experience with a brief tutorial.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's response to Uncrossy was overwhelmingly positive, with many commenters praising it as a clever, fun, and well-executed concept. The gameplay was frequently compared to the popularity of Wordle. However, several key points of discussion and constructive feedback emerged.

A significant theme was the potential to get stuck in an "unsolvable" state, which often only becomes apparent after significant progress. This led to frustration for some users who had to undo many moves. Suggestions for improvement included providing clearer warnings when a player enters a dead-end state or offering game modes that prevent such states entirely. The game's hint system was also discussed, with one user finding it essential for recovering from mistakes, while another suggested it should be cheaper to use.

Technical feedback pointed out a bug in Firefox related to the use of `const` in the global scope, which was confirmed by some users but not others, with an ad-blocker also being a potential cause. A minor exploit was also discovered that allowed a player to win by manipulating the mouse controls.

Finally, the discussion briefly touched on the developer's philosophy, which one commenter linked to the idea of treating an LLM like a compiler—where you generate a new "binary" (or in this case, a new game state) for each change rather than maintaining the old one. This sparked a debate about the viability of such a non-deterministic approach for user-facing software.
