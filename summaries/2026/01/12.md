## [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
**Score:** 1703 | **Comments:** 694 | **ID:** 46579864

> **Article:** The article "The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe" argues that recent macOS versions (specifically the hypothetical "Tahoe" release) have significantly degraded the user experience of window resizing. The author details several issues: a frustrating delay between starting a drag and the window actually moving/resizing, the hit-target for resizing being too small or non-existent, and the overall interaction feeling buggy and unresponsive. The piece frames this as a symptom of a larger problem: Apple's design philosophy prioritizing iOS-style minimalism over the established, functional conventions of a desktop OS, leading to a loss of discoverability and usability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Apple's recent UI/UX decisions, using the article as a springboard to voice broader frustrations. The core sentiment is that macOS is becoming less functional and more frustrating, with many commenters citing the window resizing issues as a prime example of this decline.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Historical Context and Decline:** Many users point out that Apple's window management has always been a weak point, referencing the historical limitation of only being able to resize from the bottom-right corner. The current issues are seen not as a new bug, but as an exacerbation of long-standing problems, driven by a design culture that devalues traditional desktop UI conventions.
*   **Critique of Apple's Design Philosophy:** A frequently quoted comment compares Apple's UI changes to "plastic surgery" on an older person, performed by designers who "think in iOS terms" and view desktop UI "wrinkles" as something to be hidden, ultimately making the OS look "weird" and less functional.
*   **Comparison to Other Operating Systems:** Commenters draw parallels to past frustrations with Linux and Windows, ironically noting that Linux now often provides a more refined and consistent desktop experience. The perceived "jankiness" of macOS is seen as Apple following a poor trend set by others.
*   **Workarounds and User Adaptation:** The discussion highlights that power users have long abandoned the native UI for these tasks. Many mention using third-party utilities like Rectangle for precise window management via keyboard shortcuts, while others note they rely on trackpad gestures or other methods to avoid the mouse-resizing problem altogether.
*   **A Call for Change:** The frustration is so palpable that some commenters express a desire to switch to Linux ("year of the Linux desktop"), viewing the current state of macOS as a significant misstep on par with Windows Vista or Windows 8.

## [Don't fall into the anti-AI hype](https://antirez.com/news/158)
**Score:** 1005 | **Comments:** 1170 | **ID:** 46574276

> **Article:** The article by Salvatore "antirez" Sanfilippo (creator of Redis) argues against the "anti-AI hype" prevalent in some programmer circles. He posits that AI coding assistants are not a threat but a powerful tool that augments human capability. Using his own experience, he demonstrates how he used an LLM to implement a complex feature in Redis, a task that would have been mentally taxing and time-consuming for him manually. He frames the technology as a democratizing force that will allow smaller teams to build more sophisticated software and expresses personal gratitude for being part of the data that trained these models, viewing it as a continuation of his open-source ethos.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with the community split between skepticism, pragmatism, and enthusiasm for AI coding tools. A central theme is the tension between the technology's potential and its practical, real-world application.

Several key points of debate emerged:

*   **Motivation and Open Source:** A prominent concern is the feeling of exploitation. One commenter expressed that knowing their open-source code is being used to train commercial models makes them want to contribute less. Others countered that their motivation for contributing was never about controlling the output but about solving personal problems and benefiting the community.
*   **Productivity vs. Atrophy:** Skeptics argue that AI tools often fail on complex tasks, invent APIs, and lead to a "brain atrophy" where developers stop learning fundamental skills. Proponents, however, claim that AI allows them to operate at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on architecture and specs rather than boilerplate, ultimately learning more about system design.
*   **The Economic Bubble:** A significant portion of the discussion focused on the business side. Many commenters believe the current AI landscape is a bubble, predicting a market "implosion" where most startups will fail, even as the technology itself becomes a useful, integrated tool.
*   **The Innovation Bottleneck:** A recurring argument is that AI models can only remix existing knowledge and cannot innovate. If AI-generated code dominates, the pool of novel ideas for future models will shrink, creating a "zero-sum game" that stifles true progress.
*   **Domain Expertise is Key:** A nuanced point was raised that AI is a force multiplier for experts but a poor tool for novices. An expert like antirez can effectively guide an AI in a familiar domain (Redis), but the same approach would fail in an unfamiliar, complex codebase without deep, pre-existing knowledge.
*   **The Real Bottleneck is Marketing:** Some argued that the primary constraint for software success isn't development speed but marketing and distribution. An AI that can "vibe code" a product doesn't solve the challenge of gaining users or funding.

## [I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too](https://www.notebookcheck.net/I-dumped-Windows-11-for-Linux-and-you-should-too.1190961.0.html)
**Score:** 794 | **Comments:** 733 | **ID:** 46574707

> **Article:** The article "I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too" is a personal account of the author's switch from Windows to a Linux distribution (specifically Pop!_OS). The author argues that the modern Linux desktop is now a viable, stable, and enjoyable alternative for many users. The piece highlights several key motivations for the switch, including frustration with Windows 11's bloat, intrusive telemetry, advertising, and forced updates. The author details the benefits they experienced, such as a faster and more responsive system, greater customization, and a sense of empowerment and "joy" from regaining control over their own computer. The article concludes by encouraging readers to try Linux, asserting that the perceived difficulty is often overstated and that the rewards are significant.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely mirrors the article's themes but adds a significant layer of practical considerations and community debate. A central theme is the recommendation of specific Linux distributions, with users suggesting Pop!_OS for its user-friendliness and CachyOS for its performance optimizations. However, this sparked a debate about what truly constitutes a "user-friendly" distro, with some arguing that established names like Fedora or Ubuntu are the better starting points than Arch-based systems.

A major focus of the conversation is the practical barriers to switching. Users repeatedly brought up key challenges:
*   **Software Compatibility:** This was a prominent concern, with specific mentions of Adobe Lightroom (suggested alternatives: Darktable, Ansel) and Microsoft Office (suggested workarounds: online versions, dual-booting).
*   **Gaming:** The consensus is that gaming on Linux has improved dramatically, with Proton enabling most solo games to run well, though anti-cheat systems in multiplayer titles remain a potential hurdle.
*   **Hardware:** The discussion touched on hardware, with one user lamenting the lack of Linux-friendly premium laptops to rival the MacBook's build quality, while others pointed to projects like Asahi Linux for running Linux on Apple Silicon and suggested better ThinkPad models as an alternative.

Beyond the practical, several comments captured the philosophical spirit of the Linux community. One user framed the switch as a move towards "joy" and regaining control over one's machine, a sentiment that resonated with others. The conversation also included a notable debate about following the lead of Linux creator Linus Torvalds, with a top comment clarifying that his choice of Fedora is highly specific to kernel development and not necessarily a general recommendation. Overall, the discussion balanced the aspirational benefits of Linux with the real-world hurdles and solutions proposed by the community.

## [Statement from Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm)
**Score:** 602 | **Comments:** 503 | **ID:** 46582420

> **Article:** This article is a public statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell announces that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a criminal investigation into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. He frames this as an unprecedented and direct threat to the Fed's independence, stating that the investigation is a consequence of the Fed setting interest rates based on economic data and the public good, rather than following the preferences of the President. Powell's statement is a forceful defense of the central bank's mandate to operate without political interference.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the DOJ's investigation and supportive of Jerome Powell's stance. Commenters express alarm, viewing this as a dangerous escalation that threatens the stability of the US economy and its democratic institutions.

There are several distinct themes in the discussion:
*   **Violation of Norms:** Many users describe this as an "unprecedented" and "crazy" event that breaks with decades of established professional and political norms. They see it as a fundamental attack on the independence of the central bank, a core pillar of modern economic stability.
*   **Political Motivation:** The investigation is widely interpreted as a politically motivated move by the Trump administration to intimidate the Fed into lowering interest rates for political gain. Users argue this would be economically irresponsible, likely causing inflation and harming voters.
*   **Praise for Powell's Courage:** A significant number of comments, even from those who have previously disagreed with Powell's policies, commend him for his courage in publicly standing up to this pressure. He is portrayed as a public servant defending his institution and the public interest.
*   **Broader Democratic Decline:** The event is frequently contextualized within a larger narrative of democratic norms eroding. Commenters link this to a pattern of behavior aimed at consolidating power, undermining checks and balances, and moving the country towards a "banana republic."

## [CLI agents make self-hosting on a home server easier and fun](https://fulghum.io/self-hosting)
**Score:** 531 | **Comments:** 350 | **ID:** 46580326

> **Article:** The article argues that a combination of inexpensive hardware (like mini-PCs), modern networking tools (specifically Tailscale), and AI CLI agents (like Claude Code) has dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for self-hosting a home server. It positions these three elements as "unlocks" that transform what was once a complex, security-conscious hobby into something accessible and fun for the average tech enthusiast. The author suggests that while hardware is cheap and networking is solved by tools like Tailscale, the CLI agents act as a "junior sysadmin," helping users navigate the remaining Linux/CLI complexity to get services running reliably.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely agreed with the article's premise, but with a significant shift in emphasis regarding which technology is the most critical "unlock."

**Tailscale vs. AI as the Primary Enabler**
While the article highlights AI CLI agents as a key component, many commenters argued that Tailscale (or similar mesh VPNs) is the more fundamental breakthrough. The consensus was that Tailscale solves the biggest historical barrier to self-hosting: security. By eliminating the need to expose ports to the open internet, it allows users to run services safely from anywhere, making them genuinely useful rather than just a local lab experiment. The AI was seen as a helpful accelerator for those less familiar with Linux, but not the core innovation.

**Accessibility and Power Efficiency**
There was a general sense that the "skill gap" for self-hosting is closing, making it a viable hobby for more people. On the practical side, concerns about electricity costs were quickly dismissed, with users pointing out that modern mini-PCs (like Mac Minis or Intel NUCs) are extremely power-efficient and have a negligible impact on a power bill.

**Skepticism and Counterpoints**
A minority of users expressed fatigue with the constant hype around AI, suggesting the article was "clickbait." They argued that the hands-on process of troubleshooting and learning the system is a valuable and enjoyable part of the experience that shouldn't be outsourced to an AI. There was also a specific warning against self-hosting highly sensitive data like password managers (Vaultwarden), with some users advising that such services require a higher level of isolation and security than a typical home setup.

## [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader)
**Score:** 438 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46578921

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source command-line tool called "icloud-photos-downloader." The tool addresses a common user frustration: the lack of an official, straightforward way to bulk download all photos from iCloud to a local machine. It allows users to download their entire photo library, which is particularly useful for backing up data or migrating to a different platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of frustration with Apple's ecosystem and debate over the actual availability of official download methods. The prevailing sentiment is that Apple intentionally makes it difficult to export photos to discourage users from leaving its platform. Users report that native apps often choke on large libraries, making third-party tools like this one essential.

However, several commenters countered this by pointing out official, albeit imperfect, alternatives. These include changing iCloud settings to download originals, using Apple's "Request to transfer a copy of your data" feature (which can move photos to Google Photos), and the GDPR data request tool, which can provide a full archive. The conversation also branched into related topics, with users seeking ways to self-host photo backups (e.g., using Immich) and expressing a general desire for more control over their personal data.

## [Statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckGHaBLSn4)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46582441

> **Article:** The linked content is a YouTube video of a press conference given by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on January 11, 2026. The video covers the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision on interest rates and its outlook on the U.S. economy, including inflation and employment. Commenters note that the official Federal Reserve website provides the same video alongside a full text transcript of the speech.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is brief and focuses almost entirely on the quality of the submission rather than the content of Powell's speech. The primary point of contention is that the post links directly to a YouTube video instead of the official Federal Reserve page. Several commenters argue that the Fed's website is a superior source because it provides both the video and a full text transcript, making the information more accessible and permanent. There is also a suggestion to merge the thread with a duplicate submission that correctly linked to the official source. Overall, the community's reaction was to correct the submission's link rather than engage in an analysis of the Federal Reserve's economic policy.

## [Gentoo Linux 2025 Review](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html)
**Score:** 310 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46574769

> **Article:** This article reviews Gentoo Linux's progress in 2025. Key developments include the successful creation of a "Gentoo for WSL" (Windows Subsystem for Linux) image, significant improvements in RISC-V support, and the release of EAPI 9 for the Portage package manager. The article also highlights a strategic move to migrate Gentoo's infrastructure away from GitHub towards Codeberg, citing opposition to GitHub Copilot. Financially, the project remains community-funded, raising approximately $20,000 in donations for the fiscal year.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of nostalgia, technical debate, and surprise regarding the project's finances. Many users expressed deep affection for Gentoo, citing its stability, flexibility, and "hacker-friendly" nature, though others noted that updates frequently required manual intervention and were too time-consuming for modern hardware.

Two main technical themes emerged:
1.  **RISC-V and Source-Based Advantages:** Users debated the benefits of Gentoo's source-based model for new architectures like RISC-V. While some argued it makes Gentoo uniquely scalable for custom silicon and embedded systems, others countered that binary distributions simply lack support due to low hardware adoption, not because of an inherent technical disadvantage.
2.  **The NixOS Comparison:** Several commenters mentioned switching to NixOS to achieve similar system customization and reproducibility without the heavy compilation times, though one user noted NixOS has its own steep learning curve and resource issues.

The most surprising takeaway for the community was Gentoo's low financial footprint (~$20k/year), sparking a debate on whether the project should be paying its core developers more. There was also strong support for the move to Codeberg, driven by anti-Copilot sentiment.

## [Anthropic: Developing a Claude Code competitor using Claude Code is banned](https://twitter.com/SIGKITTEN/status/2009697031422652461)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 154 | **ID:** 46578701

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet claiming that Anthropic's Terms of Service (ToS) prohibit using Claude Code to develop a competitor to Claude Code. The tweet highlights a specific clause forbidding the use of their services to create a competing product. However, the discussion reveals that the situation is more nuanced. While the ToS text is broad, the enforcement appears targeted at third-party tools that reverse-engineer the OAuth API to bypass the official Claude Code interface and use the Max plan as a cheap API replacement, rather than a blanket ban on all development that could be considered competitive. Anthropic has stated that the supported way to build tools is via the official API, not by mimicking the Claude Code client.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was highly critical of Anthropic, but the debate evolved into several distinct themes. Initially, many commenters expressed outrage, viewing the ToS clause as hypocritical and anti-competitive. This sentiment was fueled by broader criticisms of AI companies, with users pointing out that the entire industry is built on scraping data without permission, making their sudden enforcement of "rules" seem self-serving. A common analogy used was to imagine Microsoft banning the use of Visual Studio to build another IDE.

However, a significant counter-argument emerged, clarifying that the ban is likely not about preventing the creation of competing AI models or tools in general. Instead, it targets the specific act of reverse-engineering the OAuth API used by the official Claude Code client. This practice allows third-party applications to masquerade as the official client to access the cheaper Max subscription plan instead of paying for the more expensive API. In this context, the rule was seen by some as a reasonable measure to prevent abuse and protect their business model, rather than stifle legitimate innovation.

Finally, the discussion touched on the strategic wisdom of this move. Some users argued that Anthropic's "moat" is not as strong as they believe, and such restrictive policies will only push developers towards open-source alternatives like Opencode or other model providers, ultimately harming Anthropic's market position.

## [Meta announces nuclear energy projects](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/01/meta-nuclear-energy-projects-power-american-ai-leadership/)
**Score:** 258 | **Comments:** 294 | **ID:** 46578497

> **Article:** Meta has announced a series of projects to secure nuclear energy for its data centers, aiming to power its AI initiatives and support American AI leadership. The move is part of a broader trend of tech companies seeking reliable, carbon-free energy sources to meet the massive and growing power demands of AI computation. The article highlights Meta's commitment to nuclear as a key component of its energy strategy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical and critical of Meta's announcement, with commenters dissecting the move from economic, environmental, and competitive angles.

A dominant theme is skepticism about Meta's motives and the actual benefit to the public. Many users doubt that this investment will translate into improved quality of life or lower energy costs, arguing that Meta is simply securing private resources for its own profit. One commenter bluntly stated that this move will likely "drive up energy prices for everyone else" by making a formerly public resource private.

The economic and strategic viability of nuclear power itself is heavily debated. While some users express general support for nuclear energy, others argue that it is becoming obsolete. Proponents of renewables contend that solar and battery storage are now significantly cheaper and faster to deploy, making nuclear an expensive and slow-moving investment. A cited study suggests that additional baseload generation like nuclear is not required for the EU grid and would likely increase costs.

There is also widespread cynicism regarding Meta's corporate competence. Commenters draw parallels to the company's perceived failures in software and customer service, questioning whether a company that struggles with basic user support can successfully manage complex, high-stakes infrastructure projects. The deal is also characterized not as a new build-out but as a power purchase agreement with an existing utility (Vistra), which some see as merely privatizing a public resource rather than expanding energy capacity.

## [Instagram data breach reportedly exposed the personal info of 17.5M users](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/an-instagram-data-breach-reportedly-exposed-the-personal-info-of-175-million-users-192105616.html)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46576337

> **Article:** Engadget reports on a data breach affecting 17.5 million Instagram users, allegedly exposing personal information including usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. The report is based on a source from Malwarebytes, though the article provides limited technical detail on how the breach occurred or the specific nature of the data leak.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with widespread skepticism regarding the nature and severity of the "breach." The consensus among commenters is that the event was likely not a direct hack of Instagram's internal systems, but rather a mass exploitation of the platform's password reset feature.

The core of the skepticism centers on how easily the password reset flow can be abused. Users noted that resets can be triggered using a username (which is often public), an email address, or a phone number. This allows attackers to automate mass requests, flooding users with password reset emails and causing panic, without actually compromising the accounts. Several users confirmed receiving such waves of emails recently.

Key discussion points included:
*   **Skepticism of the Source:** Commenters found the original source (a screenshot of a password reset email) insufficient to prove a data leak, arguing it only proves someone knows a username or email.
*   **Instagram's Official Response:** A user provided a link to an official Instagram statement denying a system breach and attributing the reset emails to an "issue that let an external party request password reset emails," which aligns with the community's theory of API abuse rather than a data theft.
*   **Alternative Theories:** While the "API abuse" theory dominated, some speculated the data could have come from third-party app integrations or other unrelated breaches, rather than originating directly from Instagram.
*   **Security Advice:** The discussion pivoted to the importance of using password managers and unique, complex passwords to mitigate risks from any potential leak.
*   **Technical Context:** One commenter with engineering knowledge suggested that Instagram's codebase (Python/Django) is separate from Facebook's (Hack) and may lack some of the robust anti-leak tooling, potentially making it more vulnerable to this type of issue.

## [Poison Fountain](https://rnsaffn.com/poison3/)
**Score:** 198 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46577464

> **Article:** The article "Poison Fountain" proposes a method for content creators to "poison" their data to negatively impact AI models. The core idea is to subtly alter content (e.g., on a personal website or blog) in a way that is imperceptible to humans but causes AI models trained on it to learn incorrect associations or produce faulty outputs. The site provides a tool that generates these unique, dynamic "poison" phrases. It also encourages visitors to help "the war effort" by caching and retransmitting this poisoned data across the web, aiming to increase its prevalence in the training datasets of large AI models. The underlying goal is to act as a form of protest or defense against AI companies that scrape and monetize public data without consent or compensation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on "Poison Fountain" was highly polarized, touching on the technical feasibility, ethical implications, and strategic effectiveness of the proposed method.

A central theme was the debate over whether this technique could meaningfully harm frontier AI labs. Skeptics argued that it was "too late," as major companies have already ingested vast amounts of existing data. They suggested that future progress will rely more on post-training techniques (like RLHF) and that model collapse is a known issue that can be mitigated by sophisticated data curation. Some even worried that such efforts would backfire, inadvertently helping large corporations cement their oligopoly by making it harder for open-source alternatives to compete.

Conversely, others saw the value not in stopping AI development, but in forcing a change in its economics. The idea was framed as a "DRM for data"—if companies don't pay for data, they get poisoned results. This could make scraped data less valuable and push companies towards licensed, high-quality datasets. There was also a strong sentiment of protest against data scraping, with some commenters viewing poisoning as a justified act of resistance.

Technical feasibility was heavily scrutinized. While some questioned if an LLM could simply detect and filter out the poison, others countered that a well-designed poison is meant to be undetectable. The dynamic nature of the generated poison was highlighted as a defense against simple regex filters. A recurring analogy was to Neal Stephenson's novel *Anathem*, where the internet is deliberately polluted with "crap" to sell filtering services, and to the real-world problem of SEO poisoning search results.

Finally, the discussion included a notable personal attack, where one user directed a profane tirade against another, which was widely condemned by the community. The overall tone ranged from cynical ("fighting a wildfire with a thimbleful of water") to hopeful that this could be a catalyst for more ethical data practices.

## [This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser](https://iczelia.net/posts/snake-polyglot/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46580864

> **Article:** The article by Iczelia details the creation of a Snake game that is a single 13 KiB polyglot file. This file is simultaneously a valid Windows `.com` executable, a Linux shell script, and an HTML file that runs in a browser. The author explains the technical trickery involved, such as using shell script comments to create HTML tags (`<!--` and `-->`) and crafting the binary machine code to be ignored by the HTML parser and shell, while being fully executable by the operating systems. The goal is to demonstrate a novel form of extreme software portability and minimalism in a single distributable file.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of technical curiosity and nostalgia. The primary discussion revolved around the practicalities of running the file. Users confirmed the polyglot nature, successfully running it in browsers (by renaming to `.html`) and on Linux (though some needed to install `xz` for decompression). However, Windows execution proved tricky, with one user discovering that Data Execution Prevention (DEP) had to be disabled for it to run.

Several users drew parallels to other historical and modern examples of extreme programming. The kkrieger game (a 96KB 3D shooter) was frequently mentioned, as was the original Legend of Zelda (128KB) for its ability to create a vast world from minimal code. The EICAR antivirus test file was cited as an earlier, simpler polyglot.

Beyond nostalgia, the conversation explored the potential of single-file applications. One user suggested a clever "polyglot installer" where an HTML file could use JavaScript to offer a download of itself as a runnable executable. Another commenter connected the idea to modern web components and the power of running applications directly from the `file://` protocol, lamenting that many browser features are now restricted to secure `https` contexts.

## [Xfce is great](https://rubenerd.com/xfce-is-great/)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46584173

> **Article:** The linked article, "Xfce is great," is a short blog post by Rubenerd expressing appreciation for the Xfce desktop environment. The author praises Xfce for being lightweight, stable, and unobtrusive. It highlights Xfce's adherence to the traditional desktop metaphor (taskbar, start menu, system tray), contrasting it with more modern, opinionated desktops like GNOME. The core message is that Xfce is a reliable, no-nonsense tool that "gets out of the way" and lets the user get work done without unnecessary changes or distractions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive towards Xfce, with users sharing their personal experiences and debating its merits against other desktop environments.

A central theme is Xfce's perceived speed and responsiveness. Multiple users, even those with powerful modern hardware, report a "snappy" feel and a lack of the "click lag" or UI freezing they experience with KDE, GNOME, Windows, or macOS. This low "perceived latency" is cited as a major reason for preferring Xfce.

The debate on its suitability for new Linux users is split. One side argues that Xfce is the "lowest-BS" option, offering a familiar and straightforward experience similar to Windows XP. The opposing view is that its default "old-fashioned" look and settings menus, which resemble editing config files, might be off-putting for newcomers accustomed to more polished UX, suggesting GNOME or KDE as safer starting points.

The discussion also touches on Xfce's architecture and philosophy:
*   **Modularity vs. Performance:** One user with a technical background argues that Xfce's modular design (separate components for panel, window manager, etc.) is an architectural "antipattern" in the Wayland era, causing unavoidable latency compared to monolithic compositors. However, this view is strongly countered by long-time users who state that Xfce is already more than fast enough for productive work and they value its flexibility far more than a sliver of potential performance gain.
*   **Customization:** While some find the default appearance "ugly," others point out that it's highly customizable and can be made to look "slick" with themes, or can be configured to mimic the layouts of Windows or macOS.
*   **Alternatives and Context:** Users also recommend LXQt as a similar lightweight alternative. Practical use cases are mentioned, such as using Xfce for VNC servers or on machines with NVIDIA GPUs where it is perceived to have fewer driver-related issues than KDE.

Finally, the conversation includes a nostalgic tangent about Xfce's historical roots, its origins as a CDE clone, and links to other vintage window managers.

**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 3 | **ID:** 46575224

> **Article:** A Forbes article reports that Iran has successfully shut down Starlink satellite internet services within its borders for the first time. The article, citing research from the University of Michigan, suggests the Iranian regime used a sophisticated "kill switch" to disrupt the connection between Starlink user terminals (dishes) and the satellites passing overhead. This represents a significant escalation in Iran's ability to control information, as Starlink had previously been a reliable tool for protestors and citizens to bypass the state's severe internet censorship and blackouts. The method is believed to involve targeted jamming and interference, specifically designed to counter the low-Earth orbit satellite network.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was quickly consolidated and moved to a thread featuring a different, but related, article from TechCrunch. The primary focus of the debate was the technical and political feasibility of Iran's shutdown. Many commenters engaged in a technical analysis of how such a jamming or "kill switch" system could work, with some expressing skepticism about Iran's capability to reliably block a large constellation of fast-moving satellites, while others detailed the specific vulnerabilities in the Starlink protocol that could be targeted.

A recurring theme was the ongoing "cat-and-mouse game" between censorship technologies and circumvention tools. Users debated whether this event was a permanent victory for Iran or just one battle in a continuous technological arms race. The discussion also touched on the broader geopolitical implications, including the role of Western companies like SpaceX in foreign conflicts and the ethics of providing technology that can be targeted by state actors. The conversation was largely technical, exploring the physics of satellite communication and the limitations of state-sponsored jamming.

## [Sampling at negative temperature](https://cavendishlabs.org/blog/negative-temperature/)

> **Article:** The article "Sampling at negative temperature" explores the mathematical properties of the softmax function used in LLM token sampling. The author demonstrates that by using negative temperature values, the sampling behavior is inverted. While a standard positive temperature (T > 0) makes the distribution more uniform (increasing randomness), and T=0 selects the single most likely token, a negative temperature (T < 0) flips the probabilities. Specifically, as T approaches 0 from the negative side, the model deterministically selects the *least* likely tokens. As the negative temperature becomes a large negative number (e.g., -100), the distribution flattens out again, but in reverse order, effectively sampling from the "tail" of the probability distribution. The author notes that this produces "anomalous" tokens that often lack semantic meaning because they reside near the centroid of the model's embedding space.

## [I'd tell you a UDP joke…](https://www.codepuns.com/post/805294580859879424/i-would-tell-you-a-udp-joke-but-you-might-not-get)
**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46580946

> **Article:** The article is a link to a post on the website "codepuns.com" that presents a classic networking pun: "I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it." The humor relies on the properties of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is an unreliable, connectionless protocol where packets can be lost in transit without any guarantee of delivery.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a rapid-fire thread of networking-related puns and jokes, with users building upon the original UDP theme. The conversation quickly expands to include other protocols and concepts:

*   **ICMP Jokes:** Users shared jokes based on the Internet Control Message Protocol, such as a "Knock Knock" joke that ends with "Who's there? - Thank you," playing on the nature of ICMP echo requests (pings).
*   **Packet Ordering:** A user noted that a comment was "out of order," to which another replied "Well played," referencing how TCP handles out-of-order packets, unlike UDP.
*   **Disordered Text:** A user posted the joke "packets udp bar walk a into," which was immediately recognized as a sentence with its words jumbled, mimicking the out-of-order delivery of UDP packets. Another user mentioned their brain automatically corrected the sentence.
*   **Other Protocol Puns:** A "Put a cork in it" comment was made in reference to TCP's use of ports.
*   **Collections:** One user lamented the loss of a large list of similar protocol-based jokes, and another provided a link to a known collection called "protolol.txt."
*   **Classic Tech Jokes:** The conversation also branched into other famous tech humor formats like Jon Skeet facts, Chuck Norris facts, and Bruce Schneier facts.

## [The next two years of software engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/next-two-years/)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46580703

> **Article:** The article "The next two years of software engineering" by Addy Osmani (a Google engineer) outlines how AI is reshaping the profession. The core thesis is that the role of the software engineer is shifting from a "writer of code" to an "architect and orchestrator" of AI-generated code. Key predictions include the rise of "vibe coding," where engineers describe intent to AI agents, and a bifurcation of the workforce into high-level architects and low-level code reviewers. The article advises that junior developers must become AI-proficient immediately to remain competitive, suggesting they use AI to multiply their output and focus on skills AI cannot easily replace, such as system design, communication, and domain knowledge. It also suggests that CS degrees may need to evolve to include more practical, AI-centric tooling.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, largely split between pragmatic acceptance of the article's advice and skepticism regarding the maturity of AI tools and the feasibility of the proposed career pivots for juniors.

A central theme is the debate over the value of "original" coding versus orchestration. One side argues that senior developers are defined by their ability to solve novel problems and architect complex systems, skills that LLMs currently lack. They warn that relying too heavily on AI creates "entropy" and technical debt, comparing it to giving a novice rider a high-speed bike without teaching them how to handle it. Conversely, others argue that much of software engineering is unoriginal boilerplate, and that LLMs validate the idea that "we are all juniors now" in the face of rapidly changing tooling.

Regarding the advice for junior developers, reactions were mixed. Some found the advice practical but tone-deaf, noting that the "vacuum" in junior hiring makes it difficult for new grads to gain the very experience the article demands. Others argued that credentials still matter and that non-degreed developers leaning on AI as a crutch will likely fall behind those with a foundational CS education.

Finally, there was a meta-discussion on how developers actually use these tools. Many commenters pushed back against the "vibe coding" narrative, describing their workflow as using LLMs as a "better Google" or a tool to speed up syntax lookups, rather than an autonomous agent. They argued that the industry is focusing too much on the strawman of full automation rather than the practical reality of augmented development.
