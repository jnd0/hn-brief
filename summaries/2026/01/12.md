## [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
**Score:** 1022 | **Comments:** 452 | **ID:** 46579864

> **Article:** The article "The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe" argues that recent macOS updates (specifically the "Tahoe" version mentioned, likely a future or hypothetical release) have made the fundamental user interface task of resizing windows worse. The author details issues like a frustrating delay when starting a drag, windows refusing to resize, and the resize action accidentally clicking items behind the window. The piece frames this as a symptom of a larger problem: Apple's UI designers, accustomed to iOS, are applying mobile-first design principles to the Mac, resulting in the removal of useful UI "wrinkles" and a general degradation of the desktop user experience in a misguided attempt to make it look "younger" and simpler.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely agrees with the article's sentiment, viewing the window resizing issues as part of a broader decline in macOS quality. The discussion is characterized by nostalgia for older, more functional UI paradigms and frustration with Apple's current design philosophy.

A significant portion of the comments contextualize this as a long-standing weakness of macOS, with one user recounting how historically restrictive resizing was (only the bottom-right corner) and how Apple has consistently failed to provide clear visual cues for resize areas. Others see the current problems as a "modern" issue, ironically comparing the experience to older, jankier versions of Linux or Windows, and noting that Apple seems to be copying the worst features from other platforms.

The conversation also touches on the root cause, echoing the article's point that iOS-centric designers are failing to understand the Mac's unique interface needs. A common workaround mentioned is to simply stop using the mouse for resizing, relying instead on keyboard shortcuts or window management apps. The sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, with users comparing the OS's decline to Windows Vista or Windows 8 and stating that it's a primary reason they are not upgrading.

## [I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too](https://www.notebookcheck.net/I-dumped-Windows-11-for-Linux-and-you-should-too.1190961.0.html)
**Score:** 750 | **Comments:** 704 | **ID:** 46574707

> **Article:** Summary unavailable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many users sharing their own positive experiences with switching to Linux. The conversation revolves around several key themes:

*   **Distribution Recommendations:** Users actively debate and recommend specific Linux distributions. Pop!_OS is suggested for its user-friendliness, while others advocate for Arch-based systems like CachyOS or the mainstream Fedora. This highlights that the "best" Linux version is a common and subjective topic.
*   **Practical Barriers to Adoption:** A major focus is on the practical hurdles preventing a wider switch. The most significant barriers mentioned are professional software needs (Adobe Lightroom, Microsoft Office), which users try to solve with alternatives like Darktable or by using online versions. Gaming, once a major obstacle, is now largely viable thanks to tools like Proton, with most agreeing that games like Age of Empires work well.
*   **Hardware and Ecosystem Frustrations:** The discussion extends to hardware, particularly the contrast between Apple's polished (but restrictive) MacBooks and the often inferior build quality of Windows laptops from other manufacturers. This leads to a debate on whether to seek out better-built non-Apple hardware or to accept the hardware compromise for the software freedom of Linux.
*   **The Philosophy of Switching:** One of the most upvoted comments frames the switch as a philosophical choice, arguing that learning to use your computer more deeply leads to greater freedom and control. This sentiment is echoed by others who see Linux as a way to reclaim ownership of their digital tools from corporate control.

Overall, the discussion is a practical and philosophical endorsement of the article's message, while also realistically addressing the software and hardware ecosystem challenges that still exist for potential converts.

## [Don't fall into the anti-AI hype](https://antirez.com/news/158)
**Score:** 684 | **Comments:** 863 | **ID:** 46574276

> **Article:** The article by Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez), creator of Redis, argues against the "anti-AI hype" among programmers. He contends that AI coding assistants are not a threat but a powerful tool that can significantly amplify a developer's productivity, especially for those who are already experts in their domain. Sanfilippo shares his personal experience, stating that using AI allows him to be more productive than ever. He frames the technology as a positive force for "democratizing code" and enabling small teams to compete with larger ones, urging developers to embrace the technology rather than fear it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with many users expressing significant skepticism and concern that contrasts sharply with the author's optimistic view. The key themes of the debate are:

*   **Skepticism of Hype vs. Utility:** Many commenters feel the term "anti-AI hype" is a strawman, arguing that their skepticism is a rational response to over-promising and the "enshittification" of products with poorly implemented AI features. While most acknowledge the tech's current utility as a coding assistant, there's a strong belief that the business models are unsustainable and that a market correction is imminent.
*   **Impact on Developers and Skill Atrophy:** A primary concern is that AI tools will devalue programming skills and lead to intellectual laziness. Some developers worry that their open-source contributions are being "stolen" to train models that will ultimately replace them. Others counter that while low-level skills may atrophy, AI allows them to operate at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on architecture and problem-solving rather than syntax.
*   **The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Problem:** Several users shared frustrating experiences with AI generating incorrect code, inventing non-existent APIs, and getting stuck in loops. This reinforces the argument that AI is only effective in the hands of an expert who can critically evaluate its output. The consensus is that AI cannot innovate or create truly novel solutions; it can only remix what it has already seen.
*   **The Bottleneck is Not Code:** A compelling counter-argument is that even with 10x faster development, the real bottlenecks for success remain marketing, product-market fit, and distribution. Simply "vibe coding" an application faster doesn't guarantee an audience or a viable business.
*   **The Expertise Multiplier:** A nuanced point raised is that AI's effectiveness is proportional to the user's existing expertise. An expert like antirez gets a massive boost because the AI acts as a powerful assistant to his deep knowledge. For a novice or someone working in an unfamiliar codebase, the AI provides far less value and may even be a hindrance.

## [Statement from Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm)
**Score:** 399 | **Comments:** 385 | **ID:** 46582420

> **Article:** Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a speech in which he confirmed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has subpoenaed the Federal Reserve and threatened a criminal indictment against him. Powell stated this legal action is a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve maintaining its independence and setting interest rates based on economic data rather than following the preferences of the President. He framed the threat of criminal charges as a penalty for the Fed's commitment to serving the public interest rather than political whims.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reacted with shock and alarm, characterizing the event as an unprecedented attack on the independence of the Federal Reserve and a dangerous escalation of political interference in economic policy. Commenters widely praised Powell for his courage in publicly addressing the threat and standing up to the pressure.

Key themes in the discussion included:

*   **Erosion of Institutions:** Many users expressed concern that this represents a "sliding out of hand" for American democracy, where established norms and checks and balances are being casually broken. The move was described as turning the U.S. into a "banana republic."
*   **Political Motivations:** Several comments argued that the pressure is driven by the President's desire for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, a move that would likely accelerate inflation and ultimately backfire politically.
*   **The Importance of Fed Independence:** Users emphasized the critical need for monetary policy to be set by professionals serving the public interest, rather than by the "arbitrary whims" of a single politician.
*   **Cynicism and Exhaustion:** A recurring sentiment was that this is part of a broader pattern of political chaos being consumed as entertainment, with one user noting that politics is supposed to be "boring," and that the current conflict-driven environment is a symptom of a deeper problem.

## [CLI agents make self-hosting on a home server easier and fun](https://fulghum.io/self-hosting)
**Score:** 347 | **Comments:** 233 | **ID:** 46580326

> **Article:** The article argues that a combination of new tools has made self-hosting on a home server significantly easier and more accessible. The primary "unlocks" identified are inexpensive, powerful hardware (like mini PCs), and the use of AI-powered CLI agents (specifically Claude Code) to handle complex Linux administration tasks. The author demonstrates using Claude to set up services like Vaultwarden (a Bitwarden server) and Jellyfin, handling tasks like systemd service creation and Docker configuration. The article frames this as a way for non-experts to build a "personal cloud" and regain control over their data without the traditional steep learning curve.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but debates the relative importance of its components. The most praised "unlock" is not the AI agent, but Tailscale (or similar VPNs). Commenters overwhelmingly state that Tailscale is the key that makes home servers practical and secure by allowing easy, safe remote access without exposing ports to the internet, thus mitigating a primary fear of self-hosting.

While some users confirm that AI agents like Claude Code are a massive time-saver for Linux and Docker tasks, others express skepticism. They argue that the hands-on learning process is part of the fun and value of a homelab, and express concern about the risks of letting an AI manage critical systems.

Several practical points were raised:
*   **Hardware & Power:** Concerns about electricity costs were dismissed by many, who noted that modern mini-PCs are extremely power-efficient and have a negligible impact on a power bill.
*   **Security:** One commenter cautioned against hosting sensitive data like password managers (Vaultwarden) on a standard home setup, though others pointed out that the data is encrypted at rest.
*   **Alternatives:** Tools like Cloudron were mentioned as another way to simplify self-hosting by managing the entire stack.

## [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader)
**Score:** 341 | **Comments:** 163 | **ID:** 46578921

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source command-line tool called "iCloud Photos Downloader" on GitHub. The tool is designed to allow users to bulk download their entire photo and video library from iCloud, addressing a perceived gap in Apple's native functionality for mass exporting media.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the difficulty of exporting large iCloud photo libraries and the motivations behind it. Several users confirmed the need for third-party tools, citing that Apple's native Photos application often crashes or fails when attempting to export thousands of photos at once. There was a debate over whether Apple intentionally makes this difficult to prevent users from leaving the ecosystem, though one user countered that turning off iCloud Photo Library or using the "Download and Keep Originals" setting should handle the task.

The community shared several alternative solutions for downloading or migrating data:
*   **Official Methods:** Users pointed to Apple's Data Privacy portal as a way to request a full data archive (though criticized for the wait time) and a specific "Transfer data to Google Photos" feature available in privacy settings.
*   **Self-Hosting:** For those looking to move away from cloud providers entirely, recommendations included using `ifuse` for local file system access and the self-hosted photo manager "Immich."
*   **Migration Tools:** A direct migration path from iCloud to Google Photos was highlighted as a specific feature for those switching platforms.

Finally, there was a notable concern regarding the security of the open-source tool itself, with one user jokingly predicting a "hijack" attempt due to the high demand for such a utility.

## [Statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckGHaBLSn4)
**Score:** 323 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46582441

> **Article:** This is a YouTube video of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The video's title indicates it is a "Statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell." As the content is a video statement from the head of the US central bank, it presumably concerns monetary policy, the economic outlook, interest rates, or inflation. The original post linked directly to the YouTube video.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was very brief and focused entirely on the submission itself rather than the content of Powell's speech. The primary points raised by commenters were:

*   **Link Quality:** Users suggested changing the link from the direct YouTube video to the official Federal Reserve webpage. This page is considered superior because it embeds the video alongside the full, official text of the statement, providing a more complete and accessible resource.
*   **Duplication:** It was noted that this was a duplicate post, as the same speech had already been submitted to Hacker News using the official Fed webpage link.

The community consensus was to prefer the official government source over a direct video link, and the discussion served as a moderation note to consolidate the two submissions.

## [Gentoo Linux 2025 Review](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46574769

> **Article:** This article reviews Gentoo Linux in 2025, highlighting the project's financials (approx. $20k in donations), development statistics, and key technical achievements. Major updates include improved RISC-V support (achieving parity with amd64 for the system set), the release of EAPI 9 (the package manager standard), and the release of Gentoo for WSL. A significant political/infrastructural decision is the planned migration of repositories and contributions away from GitHub to Codeberg, driven by opposition to Microsoft's Copilot AI tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on three main themes: the unique technical value of Gentoo, the project's financial sustainability, and the migration away from GitHub.

Users express strong nostalgia and respect for Gentoo, often citing it as the "most hacker friendly" distro due to its unparalleled flexibility and customization options. The conversation highlights Gentoo's "source-based nature" as a massive advantage for emerging hardware architectures like RISC-V, arguing that it is the ideal choice for embedded systems and custom silicon where binary distros struggle. However, this is countered by practical concerns regarding the time cost of compiling, with one user noting that updating on older hardware (specifically citing GHC) could take over 12 hours.

There is significant surprise regarding Gentoo's low financial runway (roughly $20k annually), with users marveling at the ROI provided by volunteer labor. This sparked a debate about the role of commercial entities in open source, with some noting that while Gentoo survives on donations, companies like Red Hat provide necessary financial stability to the wider ecosystem.

Finally, the move to Codeberg is met with approval from the community, aligning with the project's "hacker" ethos and independence from big tech platforms. Several users compared Gentoo to NixOS, noting that while NixOS offers similar reproducibility, Gentoo remains the distro "of the heart" for many long-time Linux users.

## [Anthropic: Developing a Claude Code competitor using Claude Code is banned](https://twitter.com/SIGKITTEN/status/2009697031422652461)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46578701

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet claiming that Anthropic's terms of service prohibit using Claude Code to develop a competitor to Claude Code. The tweet quotes a section of the ToS that forbids using their services to build a competing product. It contrasts this with a separate statement from Anthropic employees who encourage developers to build on the Claude API, suggesting a disconnect between the legal terms and the stated developer-friendly goals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Anthropic, but the reasoning evolves from initial outrage to a more nuanced technical and philosophical debate.

The conversation begins with users expressing cynicism, framing the move as standard corporate hypocrisy where AI companies violate rules to build their products but then erect barriers to protect their market share. Many commenters draw parallels to Visual Studio banning the creation of other IDEs, viewing it as an anti-competitive and "silly" rule.

However, the discussion pivots as several users analyze the technical specifics. A key argument emerges that the controversy is likely about preventing reverse engineering of the OAuth API used by the "Max" plan. These users suggest the ban isn't about writing code for a competitor, but about stopping third-party tools from hijacking the Max subscription as a de facto API replacement. One commenter notes that the API itself is explicitly offered for building new tools, and the ToS restriction is likely aimed at preventing model distillation or competitors from scraping outputs.

Ultimately, the community concludes that this policy is likely unenforceable and a poor strategic move. Developers argue that Anthropic's "moat" is already thin, with strong open-source alternatives like Opencode and other model providers readily available. The consensus is that such restrictive terms will only push developers toward open ecosystems, and that the irony of a company built on massive IP theft now enforcing strict IP rules is not lost on anyone.

## [My Home Fibre Network Disintegrated](https://alienchow.dev/post/fibre_disintegration/)
**Score:** 242 | **Comments:** 212 | **ID:** 46572679

> **Article:** The author, alienchow, details the "disintegration" of the fibre optic cables in their home network in Singapore. The cables, which were installed in PVC trunking and buried under the cement floor, were found to be crumbling and sticky. The author expresses horror at the prospect of having to replace buried cables. The article includes photos showing the degraded outer jacket of the cable, which is identified in the comments as having a TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) outer jacket.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion primarily focuses on diagnosing the cause of the cable's rapid degradation. The leading theory, proposed by multiple users, is that the TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) outer jacket is susceptible to hydrolysis, a degradation process accelerated by the high humidity in Singapore's climate. This is seen as a critical design flaw for such an environment.

Other potential causes are also explored. Several users suggest that ozone, possibly generated by other equipment or materials in the storeroom, could have accelerated the plastic's breakdown. Another user proposes a chemical incompatibility, where plasticizers from the PVC trunking may have leached out and attacked the cable's jacket, similar to how old PVC cables could damage polystyrene.

There is a significant side discussion about the term "military grade," which many commenters dismiss as "snake oil" or a marketing term indicating a product was made by the lowest bidder, not necessarily for high quality.

Finally, the conversation turns to the practical problem of repair. While the author expressed concern about the difficulty of replacing the buried cable, other users offered reassurance. Some pointed out that the inner fiber itself might still be intact, as the outer layers are just protection. Others noted that the presence of PVC trunking (or "conduit") is a major advantage, as it should make it possible to pull a new cable through, though the author remains skeptical due to the length and number of bends.

## [The Concise TypeScript Book](https://github.com/gibbok/typescript-book)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46573001

> **Article:** The article links to "The Concise TypeScript Book," an open-source guide on GitHub by Gibbok. The book aims to be a quick, comprehensive overview of TypeScript, covering topics from basic types to advanced features. It is structured into 61 short "chapters," which are typically just a few paragraphs or a single code example. The project also provides PDF and EPUB downloads for offline reading.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was generally positive, with users appreciating the resource while also engaging in a broader conversation about TypeScript, documentation, and language history.

Key themes included:

*   **Assessment of the Book:** Users debated whether the book is truly "concise" given its 61 chapters. However, it was clarified that the chapters are very short, making the book a quick read rather than an exhaustive manual. The main critique was that it explains *what* features do, but not the *why* behind design decisions (e.g., the difference between `type` and `interface`).

*   **Comparison to Official Docs:** A sub-thread compared the book to the official TypeScript Handbook. The consensus was that the official docs are a great reference but can be confusingly organized and incomplete for learners. Some users found the book to be a more straightforward guide.

*   **Documentation Philosophy:** A significant discussion emerged about what makes technical documentation effective. Several users referenced the "Diátaxis" framework, which divides documentation into four distinct modes: Tutorials, How-to Guides, Explanation, and Reference. The point was made that developers often need clear guidance and defaults rather than exhaustive, edge-case-heavy documentation.

*   **TypeScript's Success & History:** One commenter mused on what might have been if Haxe (another cross-platform language) had become more popular for web development instead of TypeScript. The reply noted that TypeScript's success was due to its providing a migration path for existing JavaScript developers, rather than asking them to adopt an entirely new ecosystem.

*   **Minor Feedback:** A few users pointed out minor issues, such as an overstatement in the book's introduction (claiming TS provides ES6/7 features and cross-browser compatibility, which are features of transpilers in general) and a request for PDF downloads, which the author had already provided.

## [Instagram data breach reportedly exposed the personal info of 17.5M users](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/an-instagram-data-breach-reportedly-exposed-the-personal-info-of-175-million-users-192105616.html)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46576337

> **Article:** Engadget reports on a data breach that allegedly exposed the personal information of 17.5 million Instagram users. The leaked data reportedly includes sensitive details such as usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The article highlights the potential severity of the breach, particularly the inclusion of physical addresses, which could lead to real-world harm.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's claims, with most commenters questioning the nature and source of the "breach." The primary point of contention is that the evidence provided for the breach is weak, consisting mainly of a screenshot of a password reset email. Users and moderators point out that this does not prove a system breach, as anyone can trigger a password reset email if they have a username, phone number, or email address.

Several users share personal anecdotes of receiving a wave of password reset emails for their Instagram accounts, often for old or "burner" profiles they rarely use. This leads to a consensus that the issue is likely a credential stuffing attack or spammers exploiting Instagram's public password reset feature to cause nuisance, rather than a leak of new data from Instagram's servers. One user notes that the pattern of reset attempts they experienced suggests their data was likely leaked from another source long ago and is now being resold and used by different attackers.

There is also a discussion about why Instagram would store sensitive data like physical addresses, with some users expressing surprise and concern. A commenter with engineering knowledge suggests that Instagram's infrastructure, which is separate from Facebook's, may be less secure and prone to such issues. Ultimately, the community concludes that the situation is likely overblown and mischaracterized as a "data breach," and that users should be wary of password reset emails but not necessarily assume their data was newly leaked by Instagram.

## [A battle over Canada’s mystery brain disease](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623r47d67lo)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46572769

> **Article:** The BBC article investigates a cluster of over 200 people in New Brunswick, Canada, suffering from a rapidly progressing and fatal neurological syndrome with symptoms resembling dementia, Parkinson's, and ALS. The cluster was initially identified by Dr. Alier Marrero, who believes it is a new, environmentally triggered disease. However, the Canadian government, after a review, concluded there is no single unifying illness and that the cases are likely misdiagnoses of known conditions. This official dismissal has been met with outrage from patients and their families, who feel abandoned. Leaked emails suggest that senior scientists within the government believe an environmental factor is likely and that the investigation was shut down for political reasons, potentially to avoid implicating powerful local industries like the Irving family's conglomerate, which has a history of using glyphosate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the official narrative and largely sympathetic to the affected patients, but it explores several competing theories for the cause of the illness and the reasons for the government's inaction.

A central theme is the immense political and economic influence of the Irving family in New Brunswick. Commenters argue that their deep ties to both major political parties make them "untouchable," providing a strong motive for the government to suppress an investigation that could lead to environmental regulations or liability for a major employer. This is seen as a plausible explanation for why the issue was politically stalled.

While the original poster and some others point to glyphosate pollution from Irving's forestry operations as the likely environmental trigger, other commenters propose alternative toxins. A prominent counter-theory suggests cyanobacteria toxins (like BMAA) or domoic acid in local water and seafood could be responsible, with one user speculating that this hypothesis is being ignored by the fishing industry. Heavy metals are also mentioned as a possibility.

There is significant debate over whether the cluster is a genuine, novel disease or a "mass psychogenic illness" or a collection of misdiagnoses. The case of Morgellons is brought up as a parallel, where patients' descriptions of symptoms (like fibers affecting electronics) seemed delusional. However, others argue this is different because the primary symptom is dementia, and a key federal scientist, Dr. Coulthart, is on record believing an environmental factor is at play, suggesting the issue is more complex than a single doctor's influence.

Finally, the discussion touches on the broader challenge of investigating "mystery illnesses." Some compare the situation to other controversial syndromes like Havana Syndrome and Chronic Lyme, suggesting a pattern where the medical establishment struggles with conditions that don't fit neat diagnostic boxes. The core problem is seen as a clash between patients' lived experiences and the rigid standards of epidemiology, a difficulty highlighted by the post-COVID experience with ME/CFS.

## [Poison Fountain](https://rnsaffn.com/poison3/)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46577464

> **Article:** The article "Poison Fountain" proposes a method for content creators to "poison" their data against AI models. The core idea is to subtly alter creative content (e.g., text, images) in a way that is imperceptible to humans but causes AI models trained on it to malfunction or produce degraded outputs. This is presented as a form of protest or defense against AI companies scraping and using creative work without permission or compensation. The project encourages a collective effort, asking users to cache and retransmit this poisoned data to increase its prevalence in the training datasets of future models, effectively fighting back against what the author sees as data theft.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with users debating the ethics, practicality, and potential consequences of data poisoning.

A central theme is the strategic effectiveness of the tactic. Some argue it's a futile effort, like "fighting a wildfire with a thimbleful of water," and that large AI companies with their vast resources and sophisticated data-cleaning pipelines will easily detect and filter out such poison. Others, however, see it as a potential "DRM feature," where poisoned data acts as a penalty for companies that don't properly license or compensate for training data, while "clean" data is reserved for paying customers.

There is significant concern about unintended consequences. One prominent viewpoint is that poisoning doesn't stop frontier AI labs but instead harms the open-source community and makes models generally more "unstable and unsafe." This could backfire by giving large corporations a reason to argue against open data, effectively "burning the bridges" for everyone else after they've already harvested the clean data for themselves.

Technical feasibility is also heavily scrutinized. While some commenters doubt the method's effectiveness against models that rely more on post-training reinforcement learning (RL), others point out that it would still impact the crucial process of pre-training on new data. The challenge of detection is a key point of debate, with some suggesting LLMs could be used to filter the poison, a notion others mock as a recursive fallacy. The dynamic nature of the poison, which is generated by another LLM to avoid simple detection, is highlighted as a counterpoint.

Finally, the discussion touches on broader ethical and economic issues. Commenters draw parallels to SEO poisoning and the "Enshittification" of the internet, suggesting AI companies have already poisoned the well. There's a deep-seated distrust of the motives of large tech companies, who are seen as trying to cement an oligopoly. The core grievance for many is the lack of value flowing back to creators, framing data poisoning as a desperate act of self-defense in an unregulated environment.

## [Iran shuts down Starlink internet for first time](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2026/01/11/kill-switch-iran-shuts-down-starlink-internet-for-first-time/)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 3 | **ID:** 46575224

> **Article:** An article from Forbes reports that Iran has shut down Starlink satellite internet access for the first time. The article suggests this was achieved using a targeted "kill switch" rather than a blanket internet blackout, indicating a sophisticated escalation in the Iranian government's efforts to control information. This action is framed as a direct response to the growing use of unauthorized Starlink terminals by citizens to bypass state censorship, particularly during recent protests. The piece highlights the ongoing technological cat-and-mouse game between the Iranian regime and those seeking to circumvent its internet controls.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is brief, primarily focused on the structure of the forum itself rather than the article's content. The main point of conversation is that the submitted link to the Forbes article was a duplicate of a post containing the original source material. Moderators confirmed they had merged the comments from this duplicate post into the original one, which is why the discussion here is minimal. The key takeaway is that users interested in the conversation should follow the link to the original, more active thread. The linked discussions revolve around the technical and political cat-and-mouse game of internet shutdowns, the methods the Iranian regime uses to block access, and the ongoing efforts by citizens to circumvent these controls.

## [BYD's cheapest electric cars to have Lidar self-driving tech](https://thedriven.io/2026/01/11/byds-cheapest-electric-cars-to-have-lidar-self-driving-tech/)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46579927

> **Article:** An article from The Driven reports that BYD will equip its cheapest electric vehicles, such as the Atto 1 (sold as the Seagull in China), with Lidar self-driving technology. This model is priced around AUD $24,000 in Australia and as low as AUD $12,000 in China. The move is positioned as a significant competitive advantage, bringing advanced driver-assist features to the budget EV segment and challenging the industry's approach to autonomous technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the technological and economic implications of BYD's strategy, with a strong undercurrent of criticism towards Western, particularly US, automakers.

The central debate revolves around the merits of Lidar versus a camera-only (vision) approach for autonomous driving. Several commenters argue that Lidar costs have plummeted (by as much as 40x), making it a viable and superior option, especially as the cost of the massive GPUs needed for vision-only systems is rising. Elon Musk's steadfast commitment to a vision-only system is described by one user as an "ill timed decision." However, another commenter cautions against this "armchair engineering," demanding a full cost-benefit analysis before judging the decision.

Economic and geopolitical factors are also a major theme. Commenters note that the low price point of these feature-rich Chinese EVs means "US car manufacturers are cooked" without protectionist tariffs, which are already in place. The discussion highlights that American consumers are being "screwed" by these policies, which shield domestic industry but limit consumer choice and access to affordable technology.

There is also a notable side-discussion on safety and aesthetics. One user raised a speculative concern about potential long-term retinal damage to pedestrians from Lidar sensors, though this was not widely echoed. On aesthetics, the prominent roof-mounted Lidar sensor is compared to the iPhone's "notch"—a functional compromise that consumers may accept. The consensus is that Chinese manufacturing prioritizes function and scale over the "design above everything else" mindset prevalent in the West.

Finally, commenters touch on technical challenges, such as how to train models using Lidar data when human drivers don't use it (the answer being to collect the data anyway), and note the counter-trend of Volvo dropping Lidar from its vehicles.

## [Sampling at negative temperature](https://cavendishlabs.org/blog/negative-temperature/)
**Score:** 123 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46579374

> **Article:** The article from Cavendish Labs explores the concept of "negative temperature" in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) sampling. It explains that the standard softmax function used to convert model logits into probabilities is parameterized by a temperature `T`. While `T` is typically positive (0 to infinity), the formula remains mathematically valid for negative values.

The author demonstrates the effects of negative temperature:
- **T > 0:** Standard sampling. As `T` approaches 0, the model becomes deterministic, picking the most likely token. As `T` increases, the distribution flattens, increasing randomness.
- **T < 0:** This inverts the probability distribution. Tokens with lower logits (higher "energy") become more probable. As `T` approaches 0 from the negative side, the model becomes deterministic but picks the *least* likely tokens.
- **T = -1:** This roughly inverts the probabilities, making unlikely tokens likely and vice versa. However, the author notes that the output is often nonsensical "noise" rather than a coherent "opposite" because the model's logits for unlikely tokens are often just numerical artifacts or embeddings near the centroid of the vector space, lacking semantic meaning.

The article concludes that while mathematically interesting, negative temperature sampling is unlikely to be useful for generating high-quality text, serving instead as a tool to understand the geometry of the model's probability space.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the technical validity of the concept, its physical analogies, and potential applications for LLM research.

Several users with physics backgrounds debated the analogy to thermodynamics. One user noted that negative temperature is a real physical phenomenon (e.g., in spin systems) where adding energy decreases entropy. However, another user countered that this is merely a superficial analogy and that negative temperature makes no sense in the context of Molecular Dynamics (MD), suggesting the LLM application is a distinct "sampling thing."

The practical utility of negative temperature was a key theme. The author of the "min_p" sampling method commented that the field misunderstands temperature and that such "hacking" of inference engines is valuable research. A user known as swyx posed several follow-up questions, suggesting that while negative temperature might produce nonsense, it could be used to measure the "temperature" of human writing or to dynamically adjust sampling strategies. The original author responded that using negative temperature to generate synthetic data would likely produce "worse than random" results.

Other points of interest included:
- A technical explanation of how negative temperature inverts the softmax distribution.
- A user's insight that high positive temperatures might "unlock additional paths" for the model to solve problems, suggesting a dynamic approach where temperature is lowered once a promising path is found.
- A brief, unresolved mystery about seemingly random words ("Хронологија", "entferne") appearing in the comments, which one user speculated might be artifacts of embeddings or copy-pasting.

## [This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser](https://iczelia.net/posts/snake-polyglot/)
**Score:** 114 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46580864

> **Article:** The article by "Iczelia" details the creation of a Snake game that is a single 13 KiB file capable of running on Windows, Linux, and in a web browser simultaneously. This is achieved using a "polyglot" file format, where the same file is structured to be interpreted correctly by three different systems:
1.  **As an HTML file for browsers:** It contains the necessary HTML tags and JavaScript to run the game.
2.  **As a shell script for Linux:** It uses shell comments to bypass the HTML tags and execute a series of commands that decompress and run the embedded game binary.
3.  **As a Windows executable:** It embeds a valid PE (Portable Executable) header that allows it to be run directly on Windows.

The core of the file is a highly compressed game binary (using LZMA compression), which the shell script decompresses into memory to run. The author explains the technical steps, including how to embed the binary data without breaking the other formats and how to handle execution on each platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with admiration for the technical cleverness of the polyglot file. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Practical Execution and Hurdles:** Several users tested the file and reported their results. While the browser version worked easily (by renaming the file to .html), the Linux and Windows versions required some setup. On Linux, the `xz` package was needed to decompress the embedded data. On Windows, one user found that Data Execution Prevention (DEP) had to be disabled for the executable to launch.
*   **Historical Context and Precedents:** Users noted that while the concept is novel and impressive, polyglot files are not new. The EICAR anti-virus test file was cited as an early example of a COM/plaintext polyglot. The discussion also compared the 13 KiB size to classic games like the original *The Legend of Zelda* (128 KiB) and the more modern *kkrieger* (96 KiB), a 3D first-person shooter.
*   **Broader Ideas and Applications:** The concept sparked ideas about creating "polyglot installers" where an HTML file could offer a download of itself with the correct extension. There was also a broader discussion about the power of single-file, portable applications, though tempered by the reality that modern browser security features often limit what can be done from a local `file://` protocol.
