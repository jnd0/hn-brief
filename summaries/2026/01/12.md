## [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
**Score:** 2462 | **Comments:** 1043 | **ID:** 46579864

> **Article:** The article "The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe" argues that Apple's latest OS update represents a significant decline in user interface quality. The author contends that the "modernization" of macOS is being driven by designers accustomed to iOS, who treat the Mac's established, mature UI conventions as "wrinkles" to be hidden or removed. This approach, the article suggests, results in a confusing and less functional desktop experience. The piece specifically highlights the difficulty of resizing windows in the new OS, noting that the feature is often unresponsive, has a frustrating delay, and can cause users to accidentally click on the window behind the one they are trying to resize. The author frames this as a symptom of a larger problem where the Mac's unique interface is being sacrificed for a misguided attempt at looking "young" and modern, ultimately making it "weird" and less usable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the new window management in macOS Tahoe, with commenters expressing frustration and nostalgia for better-designed systems. A central theme is the decline in usability, with many users finding the new resizing behavior buggy and a step backward. This sentiment is powerfully articulated by a quoted 5-year-old article about Safari, which argued that iOS-focused designers were "butchering" the Mac UI by hiding its functional "wrinkles" in a misguided facelift; many felt this warning has now come to pass for the entire OS.

The conversation also highlighted a long-standing dissatisfaction with Apple's window management. One commenter detailed its historical limitations, such as only allowing resizing from the bottom-right corner for years, and the lack of clear visual cues for resizing, which they called a "ridiculous pain in the ass." This historical context suggests that the current issues are an exacerbation of a pre-existing weakness.

Several commenters expressed their frustration by looking to alternatives, with some ironically noting that Linux now offers a more refined and consistent desktop experience than macOS. Others shared workarounds, such as third-party utilities like Rectangle or obscure keyboard shortcuts, but these were often met with criticism for hiding basic functionality. The overall mood was one of disappointment, with some users stating they would refuse to upgrade and hoping Apple would reverse course, comparing the misstep to Windows Vista or Windows 8.

## [Statement from Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm)
**Score:** 817 | **Comments:** 701 | **ID:** 46582420

> **Article:** This article is a public statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell announces that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a criminal investigation into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, specifically its setting of interest rates. He frames this as an unprecedented and dangerous attempt by the executive branch to interfere with the Fed's long-standing independence. Powell asserts that the Fed's actions are based on economic data and a mandate to serve the public, not the preferences of the President. He concludes by stating that the Fed will continue to perform its duties without fear or favor, and that any attempt to criminalize its policy decisions would undermine the stability of the US economy.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the investigation and supportive of Jerome Powell's statement. The dominant sentiment is one of alarm, with many commenters viewing this as a dangerous escalation that threatens the independence of the Federal Reserve and the stability of the US economy. There is a strong consensus that this is a politically motivated action by the Trump administration to exert control over monetary policy.

Key themes in the discussion include:
*   **Threat to Institutions:** Commenters express shock and concern that a core, professional institution like the Fed is being targeted. They see this as part of a broader pattern of breaking established norms and weakening checks and balances.
*   **Political Motivation:** Many users interpret the move as an attempt by President Trump to force the Fed to lower interest rates for political gain, which they warn would lead to inflation. The action is described as being in character for a leader who demands absolute authority.
*   **Praise for Powell:** Powell is widely praised for his courage in issuing a clear and direct statement defending the Fed's independence. Even those who have disagreed with his past policies respect his stance as a public servant defending institutional integrity.
*   **Long-term Strategy:** One user offered a more strategic interpretation, suggesting the investigation is less about Powell himself (whose term is ending soon) and more of a "latent threat" to intimidate the *next* Fed chair into complying with the President's wishes.

## [CLI agents make self-hosting on a home server easier and fun](https://fulghum.io/self-hosting)
**Score:** 715 | **Comments:** 491 | **ID:** 46580326

> **Article:** The article argues that "CLI agents" like Claude Code, combined with modern hardware and networking tools, have made self-hosting a home server significantly easier and more enjoyable. It identifies three key "unlocks": inexpensive, powerful hardware (like mini PCs), secure remote access via tools like Tailscale, and AI assistants that can handle complex Linux administration tasks. The author demonstrates this by using Claude Code to set up various services (like Vaultwarden and Plex) on a mini PC, positioning self-hosting as an accessible hobby for non-experts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, identifying Tailscale and AI assistants as major enablers for self-hosting. A central theme is that Tailscale is the most significant "unlock" because it solves the primary security concern of exposing a home server to the internet. By creating a secure, private mesh network, it allows users to safely access their services from anywhere without complex firewall configuration, which many commenters cited as their main barrier to entry.

The role of AI assistants like Claude Code is seen as a powerful but secondary tool. While it dramatically lowers the skill floor by automating complex tasks like writing systemd services and Ansible scripts, some experienced users feel it's unnecessary for them personally. However, the consensus is that it makes Linux administration much more accessible to beginners.

Other key points include:
*   **Hardware & Cost:** Commenters noted that modern mini PCs are very power-efficient, making the electricity cost negligible compared to other appliances. This addressed concerns about running a server 24/7 on a budget.
*   **Security Concerns:** While Tailscale solves the network exposure problem, one user raised a valid point about the risks of self-hosting highly sensitive data like a password manager (Vaultwarden), suggesting it requires extra diligence.
*   **Alternative Solutions:** Some mentioned other tools like Cloudron that further simplify the management stack (backups, updates, monitoring) for a fee.
*   **Skepticism:** A minority of commenters expressed fatigue with the constant hype around AI, questioning the necessity of an AI assistant for tasks they find enjoyable to learn manually.

## [Apple picks Google's Gemini to power Siri](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html)
**Score:** 393 | **Comments:** 230 | **ID:** 46589675

> **Article:** According to a CNBC report, Apple has selected Google's Gemini artificial intelligence model to power a future version of its Siri voice assistant. This represents a major strategic decision for Apple, which has been exploring partnerships to enhance its AI capabilities. The deal follows Apple's previous integration of ChatGPT for certain Siri requests, suggesting a strategy of partnering with multiple leading AI providers rather than relying solely on its own in-house models. The article implies that Apple is outsourcing the core AI technology for Siri to a third party.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of surprise, strategic analysis, and skepticism regarding Apple's decision. A central theme is the strategic wisdom of the move. Several users argue that Apple is making a pragmatic choice to avoid the immense capital expenditure required for training frontier models, as they lack the data center infrastructure of Google. This is framed as Apple focusing on its strengths in hardware and "last-mile" user experience, while outsourcing the costly "bill of materials for intelligence" to a competitor with deeper pockets.

However, this partnership with a major rival is also seen as a significant risk. Commenters question the wisdom of outsourcing a core part of the user experience to "arguably your biggest competitor," and note that this public acknowledgment makes it harder for Apple to switch to its own models later.

The discussion also clarifies the context of Apple's other AI deals, with users pointing out that the existing ChatGPT integration is an optional feature, and speculating whether the Gemini deal will replace it or offer users a choice. Financially, some speculate this could be a complex offset against the multi-billion-dollar deal where Google pays Apple to be the default search engine. Finally, there is a recurring sentiment of user apathy and skepticism, with several commenters expressing that they don't use Siri anyway or questioning Apple's software prowess in the AI domain.

## [Floppy disks turn out to be the greatest TV remote for kids](https://blog.smartere.dk/2026/01/floppy-disks-the-best-tv-remote-for-kids/)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 224 | **ID:** 46587934

> **Article:** The article presents a creative DIY project: repurposing old floppy disks as physical TV remote controls for young children. The system works by connecting a floppy drive to a media center (like a Raspberry Pi). Each floppy disk is assigned a specific movie or TV show. When a child inserts the corresponding disk into the drive, the media center automatically plays that content. This solution bypasses the complex, screen-based interfaces of modern smart TVs, offering a tactile, simple, and fun way for kids to select their own entertainment without needing parental assistance or navigating confusing apps.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to the idea, praising its simplicity and the clever use of obsolete technology. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Tactile UX for Kids and Seniors:** Commenters agreed that physical media is far superior for users who struggle with complex digital interfaces. Many noted that the problem isn't just for kids; elderly relatives face similar frustrations with modern smart TVs and remotes. The tactile nature of inserting a disk or card provides clear, unambiguous feedback that a command has been registered.
*   **Modern and Commercial Alternatives:** Several users pointed out that this DIY concept has been commercialized. Products like the **Yoto Player** (which uses RFID cards) and **Tonies** (which use figures) were mentioned as popular, polished alternatives for audio. For video, some suggested using DVDs or CDs in an old computer as a similar "physical key" system.
*   **Technical Implementation and Nostalgia:** The technical aspect sparked some debate. One user pointed out that the original article's method might not actually store data on the floppy, but rather just detect the disk's presence. Another commenter suggested a more robust method would be to read the disk's serial number to trigger the media, similar to how RFID systems work. The idea also evoked nostalgia, with users reminiscing about old hardware sounds (like a hard drive seeking) and classic computer boot screens.
*   **Broader Application:** The core concept—using physical objects as "hooks" to trigger digital actions—was seen as highly extensible. Commenters discussed applying the same principle to NFC tags, SD cards in "cartridges," or even RFID stickers on business cards for their own projects.

## [Statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckGHaBLSn4)
**Score:** 357 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46582441

> **Article:** The linked content is a YouTube video of a press conference where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell delivers a statement and answers questions. The video covers the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, likely regarding interest rates, and provides an outlook on the U.S. economy, inflation, and employment. The specific date in the URL (2026) appears to be a typo or placeholder, but the content represents a standard Fed policy announcement and Q&A session.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is brief and focuses almost entirely on the submission itself rather than the content of Powell's speech. The primary topic is a debate over the appropriateness of linking directly to a YouTube video versus the official Federal Reserve website. Several users point out that the Fed's own page hosts the video and also provides a full text transcript of the speech, which they argue is a superior source for a text-based forum. The conversation quickly identifies the post as a duplicate of another submission that correctly linked to the Fed's website, and users suggest merging the two threads or changing the link to point to the official government source.

## [TimeCapsuleLLM: LLM trained only on data from 1800-1875](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM)
**Score:** 323 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46590280

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "TimeCapsuleLLM," a large language model trained exclusively on historical data from 1800 to 1875. The project is an experiment to see what kind of "personality" and knowledge base emerges when a model is completely isolated from modern information. The repository provides the model weights and code, with the architecture noted as evolving from a nanoGPT model (v0.5) to a Phi 1.5 architecture (v1), both of which are relatively small and quantizable for easier local execution.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the philosophical and practical implications of training an LLM on a historical dataset. A primary theme was using the model as a test for the reasoning capabilities of AI. Several users speculated that if this model could independently deduce or explain modern concepts like Quantum Mechanics or Relativity—which were developed after its training cutoff—it would be strong evidence that LLMs are on a path toward true AGI. However, others countered that such discoveries rely on experimental data not present in the training set, and the model might instead favor outdated scientific theories (like the hypothetical planet Vulcan to explain Mercury's orbit).

There was also significant interest in the practical accessibility of the model. Users were actively looking for an easy way to run it, such as a hosted API, a chat interface, or pre-quantized files for local tools like Ollama or llama.cpp. Commenters noted that because the model is based on standard architectures, it should be relatively easy to run on consumer hardware.

Finally, the discussion touched on the nature of the model's output. One user provided a generated response from "Charles Darwin" that was nonsensical and rambling, leading to a debate on whether this was typical for small models or a sign of insufficient training data. A meta-commentator dismissed the project's utility, joking that reading a history book would be a more efficient and accurate way to gain historical insight than querying an energy-intensive AI.

## [Ozempic reduced grocery spending by an average of 5.3% in the US](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/ozempic-changing-foods-americans-buy)
**Score:** 304 | **Comments:** 537 | **ID:** 46587536

> **Article:** A Cornell University study analyzing retail data found that US households starting on GLP-1 medications (like Ozempic) reduced their grocery spending by an average of 5.3% within six months. This decrease was driven by a sharp drop in the purchase of processed foods, including savory snacks (down ~10%), sweets, baked goods, and staples like bread and meat. Conversely, spending on yogurt, fresh fruit, nutrition bars, and meat snacks increased. The study notes that these changes reverse upon discontinuation of the medication. The impact was even more pronounced in higher-income households, which saw grocery spending drop by over 8% and fast-food spending by 8%.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion focused on the interpretation of the data, the economic implications, and the cultural context of GLP-1 usage.

Many commenters immediately clarified that the 5.3% reduction applies only to households using the medication, not the entire US population, and noted that the savings ($30–$100/month) are negligible compared to the drug's high cost. There was a debate regarding conflicting data on restaurant spending; while the main article suggests a drop in fast-food spending, a commenter cited a Bloomberg report claiming GLP-1 users actually spend 25% more at casual dining establishments, attributing this to the demographic's higher disposable income.

The conversation also touched on the societal and systemic aspects of the drug's popularity. Users expressed shock at the high adoption rates in the US (up to 16% of households), contrasting this with social stigma and lower usage in Europe. Many argued that the drug is a symptom of a larger problem: the poor quality of processed foods and "food deserts" in the US, suggesting the medication is a necessary "artificial solution" to an "artificial problem." Finally, there were cynical predictions regarding the food industry, with users speculating that lobbyists might try to restrict the drugs or that food manufacturers would develop additives to counteract the drugs' appetite-suppressing effects.

## [Xfce is great](https://rubenerd.com/xfce-is-great/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 217 | **ID:** 46584173

> **Article:** The article "Xfce is great" is a short, enthusiastic endorsement of the Xfce desktop environment (DE). The author praises it for being lightweight, stable, and fast, contrasting it with more resource-heavy DEs like Gnome and KDE. The core argument is that Xfce follows a "less is more" philosophy, providing a functional, traditional desktop experience without unnecessary bloat or constant, disruptive UI changes. It is framed as a reliable and efficient tool that gets the job done.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's sentiment, with a strong consensus that Xfce is an excellent, low-friction desktop environment. The key themes are its performance, stability, and customizability.

A major point of agreement is the perceived speed and responsiveness of Xfce. Several users noted the "click lag" or input latency they experience in modern DEs like Gnome, KDE, and even macOS, which is absent in Xfce. This "snappy" feel was described as highly noticeable and a primary reason for preference, even on powerful hardware.

Stability and reliability were also heavily emphasized. Users described Xfce as a "just works" solution, especially on older hardware or with problematic drivers like Nvidia. It was positioned as a dependable choice for users who want to avoid the quirks and occasional breakage associated with more actively developed environments.

The discussion also touched on the trade-offs. One user argued that Xfce's modular, multi-process architecture is technically an anti-pattern in the Wayland era, potentially causing latency compared to monolithic compositors. However, this was countered by other users who felt the real-world performance is already excellent and the flexibility of its modularity is more valuable than any theoretical performance gain.

For users seeking alternatives, LXQt was frequently recommended as an even lighter-weight option. The topic of aesthetics also came up, with some acknowledging Xfce's default look can seem dated, but others pointing to the vast customization potential, referencing the "unixporn" community for examples of beautiful setups. Ultimately, the discussion portrayed Xfce as a highly practical, un-opinionated, and performant choice for a wide range of users.

## [This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser](https://iczelia.net/posts/snake-polyglot/)
**Score:** 281 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46580864

> **Article:** The article by "Iczelia" details the creation of a Snake game that is a single 13 KiB file capable of running on Windows, Linux, and in a web browser simultaneously. This is achieved through a "polyglot" file format, which is a clever concatenation of a DOS COM executable, a Bash script, and an HTML file. The file is structured so that each platform's interpreter ignores the parts it doesn't understand: the browser ignores the binary code and shell commands, the Linux shell executes its part and ignores the HTML, and Windows runs the COM executable. The author explains the specific byte sequences used to achieve this compatibility, such as using `0x0A` (line feed) as a no-op for DOS and `0x0D 0x0A` (CRLF) to terminate the shell script before the HTML begins.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with admiration for the technical cleverness of the 13 KiB polyglot file. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Practical Experience:** Users confirmed the file works across platforms, but noted minor hurdles. On Linux, it required the `xz` package and was sometimes misidentified by Mono. On Windows, one user had to disable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for it to run. The browser version works by simply renaming the file to `.html`.
*   **Historical Context:** Commenters compared the game to other size-demos, most notably the 96 KiB 3D game *kkrieger* and the original 128 KiB *The Legend of Zelda*, marveling at how much can be achieved with minimal code. The concept of polyglot files was also discussed, with the EICAR test virus cited as a classic example.
*   **Modern Applications:** The idea of single-file, portable applications sparked a conversation about the potential of modern web technologies. One commenter described their work on a platform for creating complex apps in a single HTML file using web components, though others noted limitations of running such files from a local disk (`file://` protocol) versus a secure server (`https://`).
*   **Related Concepts:** A tangential discussion emerged about the "DOS stub" in Windows executables, where some programs (like old versions of `regedit.exe`) could perform actions even when run in a DOS environment.

## [The next two years of software engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/next-two-years/)
**Score:** 280 | **Comments:** 313 | **ID:** 46580703

> **Article:** The article "The next two years of software engineering" by Addy Osmani (a Google engineer) outlines how AI is reshaping the profession. The core thesis is that the role of a software engineer is shifting from a "coder" to a "code curator" or "AI orchestrator." Key predictions include:
*   **The Rise of the AI-Native Engineer:** Developers must become proficient in using AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) to multiply their output. The author suggests a junior developer using AI effectively could match the output of a small team.
*   **Shift in Required Skills:** While raw coding speed is commoditized, skills like system design, problem decomposition, communication, and domain knowledge become even more critical. The ability to review, debug, and explain AI-generated code is paramount.
*   **Advice for Juniors:** To survive a potential hiring slump, new developers should build portfolios with AI-integrated projects, learn adjacent skills (QA, DevRel), and focus on being immediately useful rather than just "trainable."
*   **Education:** The article argues that traditional CS degrees may lag behind industry needs, suggesting a need for more practical, AI-focused curricula.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article, with commenters challenging its premise, tone, and motivations. The debate centers on a few key themes:

**1. Skepticism of the "AI-Native Junior" Narrative**
Many users pushed back against the idea that AI flattens the hierarchy or that juniors can easily replace senior output. The consensus among critics is that while AI generates code, it cannot yet replace the "taste," architectural intuition, and experience required to avoid technical debt. One commenter used the analogy of an e-bike: AI allows novices to go fast without learning the handling skills, leading to "accidents" (broken systems). Others argued that the distinction between senior and junior isn't about writing original code (which is often overrated) but about knowing how to architect complex systems and navigate trade-offs.

**2. Real-World Usage vs. Hype**
Several commenters grounded the discussion in reality, stating that their experience with LLMs is primarily as a productivity booster or a "better Google," not as an automation tool that replaces engineering thought. They expressed frustration with the "vibecoding" narrative, arguing it distracts from useful discussions about how to actually integrate AI tools effectively.

**3. Bias and Motives**
The author's position at Google working on Gemini was immediately flagged, with many commenters viewing the article as AI marketing or "thought leadership" rather than objective analysis. There was a strong sentiment that these predictions serve the interests of AI vendors rather than reflecting the on-the-ground reality of the job market.

**4. The Junior Hiring Crisis**
While the article attributes a drop in junior hiring to AI automation, commenters offered alternative explanations. These included broader economic shifts (like changes to R&D tax write-offs), companies shifting focus to infrastructure (data centers) where juniors are less useful, and general post-pandemic market corrections.

**5. Education and Fundamentals**
A sub-thread debated the value of CS degrees. While the article implied degrees might be outdated, commenters defended the fundamentals of CS, arguing that they provide the necessary foundation to use AI tools effectively and avoid becoming "vibe coders" who can't debug complex issues.

## [BYD's cheapest electric cars to have Lidar self-driving tech](https://thedriven.io/2026/01/11/byds-cheapest-electric-cars-to-have-lidar-self-driving-tech/)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 287 | **ID:** 46579927

> **Article:** An article from "The Driven" reports that BYD will equip its cheapest electric vehicles, such as the Atto 1 (sold as the Seagull in China), with Lidar technology for self-driving. This model is priced around AUD $24,000 in Australia and is noted as one of the world's most affordable EVs. The article frames this as a significant move, bringing advanced driver-assist technology to the budget segment and highlighting the rapid cost reduction of Lidar sensors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the technological and economic implications of BYD's move, largely viewing it as a major disruption to the established auto industry, particularly Western and US manufacturers.

A primary theme is the debate over sensor technology for autonomous driving. Many commenters argue that Elon Musk's "vision-only" approach for Tesla is a strategic error, especially now that Lidar has become significantly cheaper (dropping by a factor of 40, according to one source). They contend that LidAR provides superior depth perception and is not subject to the same computational and cost pressures as vision-based AI. Others defend the vision-only approach, challenging critics to provide detailed cost-benefit analyses.

The conversation also highlights the vast cost and manufacturing advantages of Chinese EVs. Commenters note that BYD can offer a feature-rich car at a price point that US manufacturers cannot match, leading to predictions that "US car manufacturers are cooked." This is attributed to BYD's vertical integration and the protectionist tariffs (100%+) that the US has imposed to shield its domestic industry, a move some commenters believe will ultimately make American consumers "backwards."

Finally, there are discussions on practical and safety aspects. Some express skepticism about the safety of Lidar, with one commenter raising a speculative concern about potential long-term retinal damage to pedestrians. Others debate the aesthetics of roof-mounted Lidar sensors, with some finding them unappealing while others see them as a functional necessity that consumers will accept, similar to the "notch" on an iPhone.

## [LLVM: The bad parts](https://www.npopov.com/2026/01/11/LLVM-The-bad-parts.html)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46588837

> **Article:** The article "LLVM: The bad parts" by Nikita Popov critiques the LLVM compiler infrastructure, focusing on its complexity, instability, and performance issues. Key criticisms include:
*   **Compilation Speed:** LLVM is notoriously slow, especially for debug builds (-O0), which hinders developer productivity. This is a regression from its original goal of being faster than GCC.
*   **API Instability:** Despite the existence of a C API, it is not a panacea. Key components like the JIT (Orc) change frequently, breaking frontends that rely on it. The internal C++ APIs are even more volatile, making it difficult for downstream projects to keep up.
*   **Debuggability:** The sheer complexity of the optimizer and code generator makes it extremely difficult to debug issues. When a bug occurs, it's often hard to determine if it's in the frontend, an LLVM pass, or the backend.
*   **Optimization Bugs:** The article highlights specific issues like the Loop Invariant Code Motion (LICM) pass creating excessive register pressure, which the register allocator struggles to fix, leading to poor performance.
*   **Governance & Review:** There is a shortage of code reviewers, especially for backend changes. The review process can be slow and provides little incentive for contributors, leading to a backlog and potential quality issues.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's points, with LLVM developers and users sharing their own experiences. The conversation centers on a few key themes:

*   **Compilation Time is a Major Pain Point:** Many users, particularly in the Rust community, expressed frustration with slow compilation times. This prompted suggestions for alternatives like Mozilla's Cranelift and mentions of a promising but overlooked upstream project (TPDE) that dramatically speeds up LLVM's -O0 backend.
*   **The "Auditability" and Safety Paradox:** A recurring concern is that LLVM is a massive, complex, and difficult-to-audit codebase, which undermines the safety guarantees of languages like Rust that depend on it. However, others countered that the Rust project actively contributes to LLVM, and tools like Alive2 help verify optimizer correctness.
*   **API Instability is a Real Problem:** Contrary to the article's suggestion that the C API provides stability, a commenter with direct experience (anarazel) noted that even the C API, particularly for newer components like Orc, is unstable and breaks frequently.
*   **Specific Technical Issues:** Experienced developers dug into the technical weeds, agreeing that problems like register pressure from LICM are real. They discussed potential solutions, such as improving the register allocator's ability to "rematerialize" values, but noted that backend visibility is limited.
*   **Need for Better Documentation and Testing:** A developer working on a custom backend highlighted the lack of clear documentation for critical components like SelectionDAG and called for a comprehensive test suite starting from LLVM IR to make the system more robust and easier for newcomers to work with.

## [Date is out, Temporal is in](https://piccalil.li/blog/date-is-out-and-temporal-is-in/)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46589658

> **Article:** The article "Date is out, Temporal is in" argues that JavaScript's built-in `Date` object is fundamentally flawed because it conflates two distinct concepts: absolute points in time (timestamps) and human calendar dates/times (which depend on time zones and calendars). This leads to unreliable parsing, confusing behavior, and bugs. The author introduces the new Temporal API as the solution, explaining that it provides separate, explicit object types for different use cases (e.g., `Temporal.Instant` for timestamps, `Temporal.PlainDate` for calendar dates). The result is an immutable, predictable, and much more developer-friendly API for handling time in applications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely in agreement with the article's premise that the `Date` object is problematic and that Temporal is a much-needed improvement. However, the community's focus is on the practical realities of its current state.

The most prominent theme is that Temporal is not yet "in" for most developers. Multiple commenters point out that native support is still very limited (notably absent in Safari), with global availability being under 2%. This makes the article's title feel premature for production use, though a polyfill exists.

Other key points include:
*   **Polyfill Considerations:** While the polyfill is praised, its significant size (~51KB) is noted as a potential issue for smaller web applications.
*   **API Design:** Some users appreciate the clear separation of concerns (e.g., `Instant` vs. `PlainDate`), while others question specific design choices, such as the inability to create an `Instant` directly from date components.
*   **Comparison to Past Libraries:** Commenters reflect on the pain of previous libraries like Moment.js (which was large) and the hope that Temporal will finally provide a standard, robust solution.
*   **Tone:** One commenter found the article's writing style overly dramatic, but another defended it as a literal description of the conceptual problems with `Date`.

## [FUSE is All You Need – Giving agents access to anything via filesystems](https://jakobemmerling.de/posts/fuse-is-all-you-need/)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46580136

> **Article:** The article "FUSE is All You Need" proposes using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to create a virtual filesystem that exposes non-file resources (like databases, APIs, or application data) to AI agents. The core idea is that since LLMs are heavily trained on command-line interfaces and standard filesystem operations, giving them a filesystem abstraction is a more intuitive and powerful interface than building custom tools. The author argues this allows agents to leverage existing skills (ls, grep, cat, etc.) to interact with complex systems, effectively bridging the gap between an application's internal data model and a format the agent can easily manipulate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a robust debate on the utility of the FUSE abstraction for AI agents, balancing pragmatism against architectural philosophy.

A central theme is the tension between using a filesystem abstraction versus direct API access. Several commenters argue that LLMs are already proficient with standard tools like SQL and that forcing interactions through a filesystem adds unnecessary indirection and performance overhead. One user described their attempt to implement a similar system as a failure, noting that operations like `grep` on a virtual filesystem are inefficient compared to a native API query. The author countered that for platforms like Notion or Google Drive, the filesystem metaphor is powerful because it's a familiar paradigm that LLMs have seen extensively in their training data.

The discussion also branched into technical implementation details. Commenters suggested alternative protocols like 9P (from Plan 9) or existing frameworks like MCP (Model Context Protocol) as potentially more suitable than FUSE. A notable project, Filestash, was highlighted as a real-world implementation of this concept, which exposes dozens of data sources (including databases and cloud storage) as a single filesystem and makes them available to agents via MCP.

Finally, there was a recurring critique regarding security. One commenter strongly objected to the article's casual use of the term "sandbox," clarifying that filesystems and containers are not inherently secure sandboxes. The author acknowledged this, clarifying the article's focus was on the abstraction layer, not security architecture.

## [Sampling at negative temperature](https://cavendishlabs.org/blog/negative-temperature/)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46579374

> **Article:** The article from Cavendish Labs explores the concept of "negative temperature" in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) sampling. It explains that the standard softmax function used to generate tokens can accept negative temperature values. While positive temperature > 1 increases randomness (creativity), and positive temperature < 1 makes the output more focused (deterministic), negative temperature inverts the probability distribution.

Specifically, as the negative temperature approaches zero from below (e.g., -0.0001), the model selects the *least* likely tokens with high probability. The author demonstrates that sampling at T=-0.0001 produces "anomalous" text that appears to be composed of low-frequency tokens or those clustered near the centroid of the model's embedding space, effectively acting as a "reverse" of standard generation. The article concludes by noting that while mathematically interesting, this technique produces nonsensical output, but offers a useful mechanistic view of how temperature shapes the generation landscape.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the theoretical underpinnings of negative temperature, its relationship to physics, and the practical difficulties of evaluating sampling methods.

*   **Physics vs. ML Terminology:** Several users debated the relationship to thermodynamics. While the article uses the term "negative temperature," commenters noted that in physics (e.g., spin systems), negative temperature represents a state of higher energy than infinite temperature where entropy decreases as energy increases. However, others pointed out that in LLMs, it is purely a mathematical manipulation of the softmax function (flipping the sign of logits) and not a physical state, though it shares phenomenological similarities with population inversion in lasers.

*   **Evaluation and Utility:** There was skepticism about the practical utility of negative temperature. The author of the "min_p" sampling method commented that the field critically misunderstands temperature limits, but others noted the difficulty in evaluating sampling methods beyond standard metrics like perplexity. The consensus was that while negative temperature is a fascinating "hack" for understanding model internals, it likely produces "worse than random" text rather than a meaningful "opposite" of standard generation.

*   **Speculative Applications:** Users brainstormed potential applications, such as using high variance (or negative) sampling to generate synthetic data for training, or allowing models to dynamically adjust their own temperature based on confidence levels. There was also a discussion on whether "temperature=0" is truly deterministic, with most agreeing that it is, but that it doesn't guarantee factual correctness (reinforcing the "Skinner pigeon" analogy).

*   **Technical Clarifications:** The discussion clarified that negative temperature is distinct from "unlikelihood training" (a training technique) and that the specific value used (e.g., -0.0001 vs -1) matters because it dictates how strictly the model adheres to the inverted distribution.

## [I'd tell you a UDP joke…](https://www.codepuns.com/post/805294580859879424/i-would-tell-you-a-udp-joke-but-you-might-not-get)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46580946

> **Article:** The article is a single-line programming pun: "I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it." The humor is derived from the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is a networking protocol known for being connectionless and unreliable, meaning packets of data can be lost in transit. The joke plays on the double meaning of "get," implying that the listener might not receive the joke's data (packet loss) or might not understand its humor.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a classic example of a community building on a technical joke, rapidly expanding the theme with a variety of related networking puns. The initial "UDP joke" prompt immediately spawned a thread of similar one-liners based on other network protocols. Key examples include:
*   **ICMP Jokes:** Users made jokes about the Internet Control Message Protocol, such as "Knock Knock" jokes that don't get a response and "ping" jokes that rely on the listener "echoing" back.
*   **Packet Ordering:** A user noted that the original joke was "out of order," which was cleverly received as another UDP reference, since UDP packets can arrive out of sequence. Another user posted a deliberately scrambled sentence ("packets udp bar walk a into") that mimics this behavior.
*   **Protocol-Specific Humor:** The conversation branched out to other protocols like TCP (implied by a "bar walk" joke that requires a connection) and FORTH (a programming language with reverse Polish notation).
*   **Broader Tech Culture:** The thread also referenced other programming humor genres, like "Jon Skeet facts" and "Chuck Norris facts," and a user linked to a large collection of similar protocol-based jokes.

Overall, the discussion was a light-hearted, creative exchange where users demonstrated their technical knowledge through humor, building a collaborative chain of related puns.

## [Lightpanda migrate DOM implementation to Zig](https://lightpanda.io/blog/posts/migrating-our-dom-to-zig)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46586179

> **Article:** The article details Lightpanda's migration of its DOM implementation to the Zig programming language. Lightpanda is a "true headless browser" designed for automation and web scraping. It executes JavaScript and manipulates the DOM but explicitly excludes CSS parsing, layout, rendering, and painting. The post argues that Zig's manual memory management and allocator patterns offer ergonomic advantages over Rust for modeling complex graph structures like the DOM, avoiding the "Rc<RefCell<T>> hell" often encountered in Rust when dealing with shared mutable state and parent-child pointers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the technical trade-offs of using Zig for a browser engine and the specific use case of Lightpanda. A top comment highlights the comparison to Rust, noting that while Rust's borrow checker theoretically fits the DOM's ownership model, the reality of shared mutable state (parent pointers, event listeners) often leads to ergonomic friction. The commenter suggests Zig's manual memory management might be more direct for this specific problem, provided robust allocation strategies are used.

Users also clarified Lightpanda's scope: it handles network requests, HTML parsing, and JavaScript execution but omits CSS, layout, and painting. This led to a discussion on the utility of a "no-paint" browser, with some noting the lack of screenshot capabilities as a downside for debugging, while others highlighted its effectiveness for converting JS-heavy sites to Markdown (e.g., via `markitdown`).

Debate arose regarding Zig's stability, with some criticizing its pre-1.0 status and breaking changes, while others defended the choice by citing successful production projects like TigerBeetle and Ghostty. There was also a meta-discussion about the "Rust brigade" appearing in Zig/C++ threads, as well as a pessimistic take on Zig's future relevance in the age of AI, though this was countered by the argument that innovation will continue.

## [Statement from Federal Reserve Chair](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm?mod=ANLink)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 25 | **ID:** 46589489

> **Article:** The article is a transcript of a speech given by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at a "Fed Listens" event. The speech is largely ceremonial, focusing on the history of the Federal Reserve System's structure and its public service mission. Powell reflects on the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, and the importance of its non-partisan, data-driven approach to monetary policy. The speech does not contain any new information about future interest rate decisions or the current economic outlook.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell, focusing on three main themes:

1.  **Incompetence and Past Mistakes:** The top comments express deep frustration with the Fed's handling of post-pandemic inflation. The term "transitory" is repeatedly cited as a key example of the Fed's misjudgment, which led to aggressive interest rate hikes, widespread layoffs (particularly in tech), and a perceived long-term decline in the industry's health. There is a strong sentiment that the Fed's official economic data, particularly for inflation and unemployment, does not reflect the real-world financial strain felt by many Americans.

2.  **Lack of Accountability:** Commenters argue that Fed officials operate with impunity, protected by long terms and insulated from public accountability. The discussion suggests that Powell and other officials are more concerned with preserving the institution and their own future careers in finance than with serving the public. This perceived lack of meritocracy and consequence for failure is a major source of anger.

3.  **Political Maneuvering:** The discussion quickly pivots to the political context of Powell's potential removal by the incoming Trump administration. Users speculate that the administration's haste to replace him is driven by a desire for "revenge" and to install loyalists. It's noted that even if Powell is removed as Chair, he would likely remain a Fed governor, suggesting the administration's goal is to remove him from the central bank entirely.

## [Uncrossy](https://uncrossy.com/)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 43 | **ID:** 46582762

> **Article:** Uncrossy is a web-based puzzle game where the player must "uncross" a set of words. The core mechanic involves clicking on a word to make it disappear, which in turn causes another word to change. The goal is to manipulate the words until only one remains, which must match a target word. The game is presented as a clean, single-level experience with a tutorial, and is praised for its simple rules and clever concept.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction to Uncrossy was largely positive, with many commenters praising its clever concept, clean build quality, and simple, quickly-understood rules. The game was compared favorably to popular titles like Wordle for its potential appeal.

However, the discussion centered on two main points of friction for players. The most significant was the potential to get stuck in an "unwinnable state," where no sequence of moves can lead to a solution. Several users reported frustration at discovering they had made an irreversible mistake much earlier in the puzzle, leading to a long and tedious process of undoing moves. Suggestions for improvement included adding a notification to warn players they are in a dead end or designing levels to prevent such states from occurring early on.

Other minor points included a bug preventing the game from working in Firefox (attributed to a `const` declaration in the global scope and ad-blockers), an exploit that allows cheating via right-clicking, and appreciation for the undo/redo functionality. A tangential discussion also emerged about the development philosophy of treating an LLM like a compiler, sparked by the author's bio.
