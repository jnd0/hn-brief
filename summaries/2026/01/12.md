## [The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe](https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/)
**Score:** 1466 | **Comments:** 595 | **ID:** 46579864

> **Article:** The article "The struggle of resizing windows on macOS Tahoe" argues that recent macOS updates (specifically the "Tahoe" interface refresh) have degraded the user experience of window management. The author contends that Apple's drive to "modernize" the Mac interface by borrowing from iOS is the root cause. This philosophy results in the removal of visual cues (like window frames), the introduction of non-obvious gestures, and new bugs, such as a frustrating delay when initiating a window resize. The piece frames this as a fundamental misunderstanding by current Apple designers of the Mac's established usability conventions, prioritizing a minimalist aesthetic over functional utility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Apple's design choices, characterizing the window resizing issues in macOS Tahoe as symptomatic of a broader decline in Mac usability. A recurring theme is the "iOS-ification" of macOS, a sentiment captured by a quoted passage describing Apple's approach as a "butchery" of the Mac's traditional interface by designers who view its features as "wrinkles" to be hidden. Commenters express frustration that Apple is removing visual affordances (like window frames) and introducing bugs that make basic tasks difficult, with some noting the irony that Linux now offers a more refined and consistent desktop experience.

Many users shared personal anecdotes of Apple's poor window management history, such as the era when only the bottom-right corner could be used for resizing. The discussion also highlighted workarounds, with users mentioning third-party tools like Rectangle and obscure keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Option-clicking corners) as essential for productivity. The sentiment is that Apple is prioritizing form over function, leading some to declare they will not upgrade. The conversation concluded with a sense of schadenfreude and a belief that Apple's missteps might finally push users toward Linux, especially given the perceived shortcomings of Windows 11.

## [I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too](https://www.notebookcheck.net/I-dumped-Windows-11-for-Linux-and-you-should-too.1190961.0.html)
**Score:** 788 | **Comments:** 721 | **ID:** 46574707

> **Article:** The article, titled "I dumped Windows 11 for Linux, and you should too," is a personal testimonial advocating for switching from Windows to Linux. The author expresses frustration with the user experience of Windows 11, citing issues like bloatware, intrusive ads, privacy concerns, and forced updates. The core argument is that switching to Linux brought back a sense of "joy" and control over the computing experience. The piece aims to persuade readers that modern Linux is more accessible and rewarding than its historical reputation suggests, encouraging them to reclaim their computers from the constraints of modern Windows.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely mirrors the article's themes, focusing on practical advice, common barriers to adoption, and the philosophical appeal of Linux.

A significant portion of the conversation revolves around hardware and user experience. One commenter recommended System76 and Pop!_OS for a polished experience, while another debated what constitutes a "user-friendly" distribution, suggesting Fedora or Ubuntu over Arch-based ones. The topic of laptops sparked a debate about Apple's hardware quality versus other manufacturers, with many agreeing that while Apple builds superior hardware, Linux can run on alternatives like Asahilinux for Macs or better-model ThinkPads.

A major theme was the practical hurdles preventing a full switch. Key blockers mentioned were specific software dependencies, most notably Adobe Lightroom (with Darktable suggested as an alternative) and Microsoft Office applications like PowerPoint and Excel (with workarounds including dual-booting or using online versions). Gaming was also raised, but commenters were optimistic, pointing to Proton's success in running most solo and multiplayer games.

Finally, several comments touched on the philosophical and personal motivations for switching. One user argued that the switch is about empowerment and learning, encouraging others to embrace the command line to gain freedom and control over their tools. Another user, who switched to Fedora, cited following Linus Torvalds' lead, which prompted a clarification that his choice is specific to kernel development needs. The thread also noted a parallel, ongoing discussion on HN about a similar topic, indicating a high level of interest in the subject.

## [Statement from Jerome Powell](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20260111a.htm)
**Score:** 561 | **Comments:** 470 | **ID:** 46582420

> **Article:** Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a statement addressing the fact that he and the institution have been subpoenaed by the Department of Justice (DOJ), with the threat of criminal indictment looming. Powell explicitly frames this legal pressure as a direct response to the Federal Reserve's refusal to lower interest rates to satisfy the preferences of President Donald Trump. He asserts that the DOJ's actions are a consequence of the Fed maintaining its independence and setting monetary policy based on economic data and public service, rather than political directives. The statement serves as a defense of the central bank's autonomy and a warning against the weaponization of the justice system to enforce economic policy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is one of shock, alarm, and strong support for Jerome Powell. Commenters widely view the DOJ's threat as a dangerous, unprecedented attack on the institutional independence of the Federal Reserve and a further erosion of the checks and balances essential to American democracy. Many express a sense of disbelief and concern that the "guardrails" of government are failing, with some describing the situation as a slide toward a "banana republic."

While there is a recognition that Powell has made policy mistakes in the past, commenters largely agree that his current stance is courageous and necessary. The discussion highlights the absurdity of using criminal charges to influence interest rate decisions, which are meant to be based on economic fundamentals, not the "whims of the president." The consensus is that this event represents a critical and dangerous moment for the stability of US institutions.

## [CLI agents make self-hosting on a home server easier and fun](https://fulghum.io/self-hosting)
**Score:** 469 | **Comments:** 293 | **ID:** 46580326

> **Article:** The article argues that "CLI agents" like Claude Code, combined with inexpensive hardware and modern networking tools, are making self-hosting on a home server significantly easier and more enjoyable. It presents a practical guide for setting up a home server (e.g., a mini PC) to run services like Vaultwarden (password manager), Plex (media), and others. The core thesis is that AI assistants can bridge the skill gap for Linux administration, handling tasks like writing systemd services, configuring Docker containers, and troubleshooting, which previously deterred many potential hobbyists. The author positions this combination as a major unlock for personal computing, allowing individuals to run their own "private cloud" with less friction.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but highlights different "unlocks." The most significant point of consensus is the importance of Tailscale (or similar mesh VPNs). Many commenters argue that secure, remote access without exposing ports to the internet is the true game-changer for making home servers practical and safe, even more so than AI assistance.

While commenters are positive about AI tools like Claude Code for lowering the barrier to entry, there is a notable undercurrent of skepticism. Some experienced users feel the fun lies in learning the underlying systems themselves and worry about the risks of ceding control to an AI, fearing catastrophic mistakes like data loss. The debate also touches on practical concerns, such as the low power consumption of modern mini-PCs (addressing electricity cost fears) and the wisdom of hosting highly sensitive data like password managers on a self-hosted setup. Overall, the community sees this as a golden age for homelabbing, where the skill gap is closing, but the "how" and "why" are still actively debated.

## [iCloud Photos Downloader](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader)
**Score:** 409 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46578921

> **Article:** The article links to an open-source command-line tool called "iCloud Photos Downloader" on GitHub. This tool allows users to bulk download their entire photo and video library from iCloud. It addresses a common frustration among Apple users: the lack of an official, straightforward way to export all photos at once, as the native Photos app often chokes on large libraries (tens of thousands of photos).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a mix of user frustration with Apple's ecosystem and debate over the actual availability of official export methods. The core sentiment is that Apple makes it intentionally difficult for users to retrieve and move their data, a practice often described as "vendor lock-in." Users express a strong desire for self-hosting solutions to regain control over their personal data, with several commenters suggesting tools like Immich for self-hosted photo management and libimobiledevice for local backups.

However, there is significant pushback against the idea that no official method exists. Several users point to the Data & Privacy portal (privacy.apple.com) as a solution. They highlight two main official options: first, requesting a full data archive (GDPR request), which can take days or weeks to generate, and second, using the "Transfer a copy of your data" feature to directly migrate photos and videos to Google Photos. While these official methods exist, many commenters find them slow, cumbersome, or insufficient compared to a direct, scriptable downloader, leading them to prefer third-party tools for speed and control.

## [Statement by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KckGHaBLSn4)
**Score:** 341 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46582441

> **Article:** The article is a YouTube video of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome F. Powell. The content of the speech itself is not described in the post, but it is an official statement from the head of the U.S. central bank, likely concerning monetary policy, inflation, interest rates, or the economic outlook.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was brief and focused entirely on the submission's format rather than the substance of Powell's speech. The primary points of contention were that the post linked directly to a YouTube video instead of the official Federal Reserve webpage, which also contains a full text transcript of the remarks. Several users flagged the post as a duplicate of another submission that correctly linked to the Fed's site. The consensus was that the official source is superior, and the thread served as a request for moderators to either update the link or merge the discussion with the other, better-formatted post.

## [Gentoo Linux 2025 Review](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2026/01/05/new-year.html)
**Score:** 308 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46574769

> **Article:** The article is a review of Gentoo Linux in 2025, highlighting the project's health and technical progress. Key points include:
- **Financials**: The project operates on a very modest budget (approx. $20k/year), relying almost entirely on small community donations.
- **Technical Progress**: Significant achievements noted are improved support for the RISC-V architecture, the release of Gentoo for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and the introduction of EAPI 9 for the Portage package manager.
- **Infrastructure**: A major decision highlighted is the plan to migrate repositories and contributions away from GitHub to Codeberg, driven by opposition to Microsoft's Copilot AI tools.
- **Community Trends**: The article notes a stabilization in development metrics, with fewer commits and bug reports compared to previous years.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on three main themes: the project's financial sustainability, its technical advantages, and the migration away from GitHub.

**Financial Sustainability**
There was a mix of admiration and concern regarding Gentoo's low operating budget. Some users noted the incredible "return on investment" achieved by volunteer labor, while others questioned why the project doesn't use its funds to pay core developers. One commenter contrasted this with commercial Linux vendors (Red Hat, SUSE) who have successfully monetized their contributions.

**Technical Merits and Trade-offs**
Users debated the practicality of using Gentoo today.
- **RISC-V/Embedded**: Many highlighted that Gentoo's source-based nature makes it uniquely suited for new architectures like RISC-V, as it doesn't require massive build farms to bootstrap.
- **The "NixOS" Comparison**: A recurring comparison was with NixOS. Several long-time Gentoo users mentioned switching to NixOS to maintain consistent configurations across multiple machines, though others criticized NixOS for its complexity and high resource usage.
- **Maintenance**: Users acknowledged the "hacker friendly" nature and flexibility of Gentoo but admitted that updating can be unstable and time-consuming (e.g., compiling large packages like GHC taking hours).

**GitHub Migration**
The planned move to Codeberg was met with approval by many, validating the project's stance on software freedom and opposition to AI scraping. However, a few users expressed skepticism about the practicality of moving away from GitHub's massive ecosystem.

## [Anthropic: Developing a Claude Code competitor using Claude Code is banned](https://twitter.com/SIGKITTEN/status/2009697031422652461)
**Score:** 279 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46578701

> **Article:** A tweet from SIGKITTEN alleges that Anthropic's terms of service for its "Claude Code" product explicitly ban using the tool to develop a competitor. The tweet quotes a clause from the ToS that prohibits using the service to create a competing product. This is contrasted with a separate statement from an Anthropic employee who claimed the company supports building on Claude via its API and welcomes integrations, creating a perceived contradiction between the company's official policy and its public messaging.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Anthropic, with the initial sentiment largely viewing the alleged ToS clause as hypocritical. Many commenters pointed to the irony of an AI company, whose models were trained on vast amounts of copyrighted and public data, now attempting to use legal terms to protect itself from competition. This was framed as a classic example of corporate power dynamics: "He who has the most gold makes the rules."

However, the conversation evolved with more nuanced interpretations. A key counter-argument emerged, suggesting the outrage was based on a misunderstanding of the term "use." One highly upvoted comment argued the policy is not meant to stop someone from *using* Claude Code to write code for a competitor, but rather to prevent *reverse-engineering* Claude Code's specific API implementation to create a "harness" that bypasses the official API and directly accesses Anthropic's systems (e.g., mimicking the Max plan's functionality). This interpretation is supported by another user who posted an image of an API error message that third-party tools would encounter, suggesting these tools were already trying to circumvent the intended API.

The discussion also branched into practical concerns and alternatives. Some users argued the policy is a poor business move, as Anthropic's moat isn't large enough to alienate users who could easily switch to competitors like "opencode" or other open-source models. Several commenters shared their personal strategies for moving away from locked-in ecosystems, using a mix of cheaper models, open-source tools, and local hardware. Ultimately, while some defended the policy as a reasonable measure to protect their API from being used as a free-for-all backend, the dominant theme was skepticism towards Anthropic's motives and a belief that such restrictions are anti-competitive in a field built on widespread data scraping.

## [Meta announces nuclear energy projects](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/01/meta-nuclear-energy-projects-power-american-ai-leadership/)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 284 | **ID:** 46578497

> **Article:** Meta has announced a series of projects to secure nuclear energy for its data centers, aiming to power its growing AI infrastructure. The company has signed agreements with energy providers, such as Vistra, to source power from existing nuclear facilities. This move is framed as a commitment to sustainable, reliable energy to support American AI leadership and meet its own clean energy goals, while also addressing the massive and increasing energy demands of its AI operations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of Meta's announcement, with commenters questioning the company's motives, the economic viability of nuclear power compared to renewables, and the broader societal impact.

A dominant theme is cynicism toward Meta's intentions. Many users argue the move is purely for corporate profit and securing a private energy advantage, not for public good. One commenter sharply criticized the idea that this would benefit society, stating, "Meta isn’t doing this out of generosity to society." Another user, 'idiotsecant', pointed out that by purchasing power from existing plants, Meta is making a "formerly publicly available resource private," which could drive up energy prices for everyone else.

The discussion also featured a significant debate on the merits of nuclear versus renewable energy. While some users expressed relief that "somebody is doing it" and that the world needs more energy, others argued that nuclear is becoming obsolete. 'epistasis' contended that renewables are now the cheapest source of electricity and that a major European grid study concluded new nuclear would likely increase costs. 'Fazebooking' added that investment in renewables and battery storage would be a faster and more globally accessible solution than nuclear.

Finally, commenters raised concerns about the practicalities and side effects of Meta's strategy. These ranged from regulatory questions about funding decommissioning to sarcastic remarks linking nuclear energy to poor customer service. The overall sentiment was one of deep skepticism, viewing the announcement less as a genuine step toward sustainability and more as a self-serving corporate strategy with potential negative consequences for the public.

## [Instagram data breach reportedly exposed the personal info of 17.5M users](https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/an-instagram-data-breach-reportedly-exposed-the-personal-info-of-175-million-users-192105616.html)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46576337

> **Article:** Engadget reports on a data breach affecting 17.5 million Instagram users. The leaked data reportedly includes sensitive personal information such as usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The article attributes the leak to a third-party app, citing a report from Malwarebytes as its source.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's claims, focusing on a lack of evidence and alternative explanations for the reported events.

A central theme is the questionable sourcing of the news report. Multiple users point out that the original "source" appears to be just a screenshot of a password reset email, which is not proof of a data breach. Commenters express a desire for a more reputable source with specific details on how the leak occurred.

Many users propose that the wave of password reset emails, which several commenters confirm receiving, is not the result of a breach of Instagram's systems. Instead, they suggest it's a brute-force or automated attack where spammers trigger resets using publicly available information like usernames or email addresses. This causes a nuisance for users but does not necessarily mean Instagram's internal data has been compromised.

The discussion also touches on broader security topics. Users advocate for password managers and unique, complex passwords to mitigate risks from any potential leak. There is also speculation about the source of the data, with one user theorizing that Instagram's infrastructure may be less secure than Facebook's, making it more susceptible to such issues. Finally, a user notes that Instagram officially responded, stating there was "no breach of our systems" and that the password reset emails were the result of an external party requesting them.

## [Poison Fountain](https://rnsaffn.com/poison3/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46577464

> **Article:** The article "Poison Fountain" proposes a method for content creators to "poison" their data against AI training models. The core idea is to subtly alter creative content (like text or art) in a way that is imperceptible to humans but causes AI models trained on it to become unstable or produce flawed outputs. The website acts as a call to action, encouraging a distributed effort where users cache and retransmit this poisoned data across the web, effectively making it part of the training corpus for future models. The stated goal is to disrupt the practice of large AI companies scraping data without permission or compensation, creating a "DRM for data" where only licensed, un-poisoned data functions correctly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a deeply skeptical and divided view on the viability and intent of the "Poison Fountain" concept. The central debate revolves around whether this is an effective form of protest or a counterproductive strategy.

Many commenters expressed doubt about the technical effectiveness of the approach. Several argued that major AI labs have sophisticated data cleaning and curation pipelines that would likely filter out such poisoned data before it ever reaches the training set. It was also noted that recent advancements in AI performance are less dependent on pre-training data and more reliant on post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning (RL), meaning data poisoning might not impact the most advanced models. The idea that an LLM could be used to detect poisoning was met with sarcasm, highlighting the potential for an endless arms race.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the potential negative consequences. One prominent view is that poisoning would not stop large corporations but would instead harm open-source AI efforts and make models generally more "unstable and unsafe." A cynical interpretation, voiced by multiple users, is that the project could be a strategic move by established "insider" companies to sabotage open competition and cement their own oligopoly by making public data unusable.

Finally, there was a philosophical debate about the ethics and goals. Some users framed it as a justified "war effort" to fight back against data theft, while others saw it as sabotage. The conversation also touched on the broader economic motivations, with some believing that the only way to stop AI companies is to attack their monetization potential, which current data-poisoning efforts may not achieve.

## [BYD's cheapest electric cars to have Lidar self-driving tech](https://thedriven.io/2026/01/11/byds-cheapest-electric-cars-to-have-lidar-self-driving-tech/)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 223 | **ID:** 46579927

> **Article:** An article from "The Driven" reports that BYD will equip its cheapest electric vehicles, such as the Atto 1 (sold as the Seagull in China), with LiDAR technology for self-driving capabilities. The car is priced around AUD $24,000 in Australia and is noted as a high-volume seller globally. The article positions this move as a significant competitive advantage, bringing advanced driver-assist features to the budget segment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely frames BYD's move as a disruptive victory for LiDAR technology and a major threat to Western automakers, particularly Tesla.

The central technical debate concerns the cost and utility of LiDAR versus camera-only ("vision-only") systems. Many commenters argue that LiDAR prices have plummeted (dro by as much as 40x), making it affordable for budget cars. They contend that relying solely on cameras is an "ill-timed" mistake by Elon Musk, especially as the computational cost of vision-based AI increases. However, skeptics challenge these cost assumptions, demanding rigorous math before judging executive decisions.

Discussion also highlights the geopolitical and economic implications. Users note that BYD's vertical integration allows for low prices that US manufacturers cannot match, suggesting the US industry is "cooked." There is strong agreement that high tariffs are the only reason BYD is not dominating the US market, with some commenters expressing a desire to buy the vehicle if it were available.

Secondary threads touched on:
*   **Safety:** One user raised a speculative concern about potential long-term retinal damage to pedestrians from LiDAR sensors, though this was a minority view.
*   **Design:** Commenters debated the aesthetics of roof-mounted LiDAR sensors, with many arguing that Chinese consumers prioritize functionality over the "design above everything" mindset prevalent in the West.
*   **Data:** Users discussed the technical feasibility of training models using LiDAR data, agreeing that it is manageable through simulation and manual driving logs.

**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 3 | **ID:** 46575224

> **Article:** An article from Forbes reports that Iran has shut down Starlink satellite internet access within its borders for the first time. The move is seen as an escalation in the Iranian government's efforts to control information and suppress dissent by cutting off access to uncensored internet. The article details how Iran is employing sophisticated methods, including targeted jamming and geolocation techniques, to identify and disable Starlink terminals being used illegally within the country. This "kill switch" action follows previous attempts by the regime to disrupt the service and highlights the growing cat-and-mouse game between authoritarian states and decentralized communication technologies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was short-lived, as moderators quickly consolidated the comments into an existing thread for a more original source article on the same topic. The initial comments before the merge noted this was a duplicate post and pointed to the ongoing conversation elsewhere. The discussion in the linked, primary thread (item 46573384) centers on the technical and geopolitical aspects of Iran's actions. Key points include skepticism about the effectiveness of Iran's jamming attempts, with users debating whether it's a localized, temporary disruption or a widespread, permanent block. There is also significant discussion about the methods Iran might be using to locate and confiscate terminals, such as radio frequency (RF) detection, and the countermeasures Starlink could employ, like beamforming and steering beams away from detection. The conversation touches on the legality of using unlicensed equipment in Iran, the ethics of providing technology that circumvents state control, and the broader implications for internet freedom versus national sovereignty.

## [This game is a single 13 KiB file that runs on Windows, Linux and in the Browser](https://iczelia.net/posts/snake-polyglot/)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46580864

> **Article:** The linked article by "Iczelia" details the creation of a Snake game that is a single 13 KiB file capable of running on Windows, Linux, and in a web browser simultaneously. This is achieved through a "polyglot" file format, which is structured to be valid in multiple contexts. The file is simultaneously a valid Windows PE executable (`.com`), a Linux shell script, and an HTML file. The author explains the technical trickery involved, such as using HTML comments to hide shell script commands and executable code, allowing the file to be interpreted correctly by each system's respective environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of technical curiosity and nostalgia. The initial discussion focused on the practicalities of running the file, with users sharing their experiences: it works in browsers by renaming to `.html`, on Linux it requires the `xz` package and is best executed with `bash`, and on Windows it may be blocked by security features like Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

Several commenters placed the achievement in a broader context. Some were reminded of other size-demos, like the 96k FPS game *kkrieger*, and noted that while the concept is old, its application here is clever. Others drew parallels to the efficiency of classic games like *The Legend of Zelda* (128k), marveling at how much content was packed into small files. The discussion also touched upon the history of polyglot files, with the EICAR test string being cited as a famous early example. A few users explored related ideas, such as the potential of single-file web applications and the historical quirk of Windows executables having a DOS compatibility stub.

## [Sampling at negative temperature](https://cavendishlabs.org/blog/negative-temperature/)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46579374

> **Article:** The article from Cavendish Labs explores the concept of "negative temperature" in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) sampling. It explains that standard sampling uses a temperature parameter (T) to control the randomness of token selection. Positive temperatures (T > 0) flatten the probability distribution, with T=1 being the default and higher T leading to more randomness. The author demonstrates that mathematically extending this to negative temperatures inverts the distribution. As T approaches 0 from the negative side, the model deterministically selects the *least likely* tokens. At moderately negative temperatures, the model generates highly random and nonsensical text, often picking tokens that are semantically distant from the context. The author concludes that while this is a fascinating mathematical curiosity, it produces "worse than random" output and is not useful for practical generation, but it provides a deeper understanding of how LLMs work.

## [I'd tell you a UDP joke…](https://www.codepuns.com/post/805294580859879424/i-would-tell-you-a-udp-joke-but-you-might-not-get)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46580946

> **Article:** The article is a link to a post on the website "codepuns.com" containing a classic networking pun: "I'd tell you a UDP joke, but you might not get it." The humor relies on the properties of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is an unreliable, connectionless protocol where packets can be lost or dropped without notification.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a rapid-fire thread of networking-themed puns and variations on the original joke. The community quickly expanded the theme to include other protocols and technical concepts. Key points in the conversation include:

*   **Protocol Expansion:** Users immediately extended the joke to other networking protocols. An ICMP joke ("Knock Knock / Who's there? / Thank you") was shared, along with a technical pun on Time To Live (TTL) causing a ping to fail.
*   **Packet Ordering:** A user noted the thread was "out of order," referencing how TCP ensures ordering while UDP does not. Another user posted a scrambled sentence ("packets udp bar walk a into") which naturally reassembles in the reader's mind, mimicking the "fire and forget" nature of UDP.
*   **Technical Humor:** The thread included other "programmer joke" formats, such as a variation on the "10 types of people" binary joke and a reference to the "2 FORTH programmers walk into a bar" joke.
*   **Collections:** A user lamented losing a collection of hundreds of protocol-specific jokes, prompting another to share a link to a large text file archive of similar humor.

## [Xfce is great](https://rubenerd.com/xfce-is-great/)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46584173

> **Article:** The article "Xfce is great" is a short, enthusiastic endorsement of the Xfce desktop environment (DE). The author praises Xfce for being lightweight, stable, and unobtrusive, valuing its "get out of your way" philosophy over the constant UI changes seen in modern operating systems. The core argument is that Xfce respects the user's workflow by providing a traditional, efficient desktop metaphor without unnecessary bloat or "fluff."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's sentiment, with a strong consensus that Xfce is an excellent, low-friction desktop environment. A major theme is its perceived responsiveness and lack of "click lag," with multiple users noting that Xfce feels significantly snappier than Windows, macOS, or even heavier Linux DEs like Gnome and KDE, regardless of hardware specifications. This perceived latency is a key reason many users prefer it.

However, the discussion also presents a counterpoint regarding its suitability for new Linux users. One commenter argues that Xfce's default "old-fashioned" look and config-file-like settings might give a false impression of its capabilities and could be intimidating. They suggest that more modern-looking DEs like Gnome might be a safer starting point for those unfamiliar with Linux.

Other key points include:
*   **Alternatives:** LXQt is recommended as a similarly lightweight but more modern-feeling alternative.
*   **Customization:** While some find the default appearance "ugly," others point out that it's highly customizable and can be made to look very slick, sharing links to community themes.
*   **Technical Debate:** A more technical sub-thread debated Xfce's modular architecture. One user argued that its component-based design (separate panel, window manager, etc.) is an architectural performance anti-pattern in the Wayland era, causing unavoidable latency compared to monolithic compositors. This was met with rebuttals stating that any such latency is imperceptible in practice and that the flexibility of modularity is far more valuable than a theoretical performance gain.
*   **Philosophy:** The conversation touches on the broader philosophy of UI design, with some users criticizing commercial OSes for changing UIs for marketing reasons rather than user benefit, a problem Xfce avoids.

## [FUSE is All You Need – Giving agents access to anything via filesystems](https://jakobemmerling.de/posts/fuse-is-all-you-need/)

> **Article:** The article "FUSE is All You Need" proposes using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to create virtual filesystems as a universal interface for AI agents to interact with non-file-based data and services. The author argues that since LLMs are heavily trained on CLI and filesystem operations, presenting data like databases, emails, or application state as a directory tree makes it more intuitive for agents to manipulate. This approach aims to bridge the gap between an application's internal data model and a format that agents can easily work with using standard tools, avoiding the need for custom, bespoke APIs for every service.
