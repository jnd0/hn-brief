## [Bluetooth Headphone Jacking: A Key to Your Phone [video]](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-bluetooth-headphone-jacking-a-key-to-your-phone)
**Score:** 411 | **Comments:** 137 | **ID:** 46453204

> **Article:** The linked content is a presentation from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3) detailing a set of critical vulnerabilities, collectively named "Bluetooth Headphone Jacking," found in Bluetooth System-on-Chips (SoCs) from the manufacturer Airoha. These chips are used in a wide range of popular wireless headphones and earbuds from brands like Sony, Marshall, Jabra, and Beyerdynamic.

The core of the attack involves a three-step process:
1.  **Silent Connection:** An attacker in physical proximity can establish an unauthenticated Bluetooth connection to the target headphones.
2.  **Data Exfiltration:** Using Airoha's proprietary "RACE" protocol, the attacker can dump the device's flash memory without any credentials.
3.  **Trust Exploitation:** This memory dump contains the Bluetooth Link Key, a cryptographic secret used to establish a trusted relationship with paired devices like smartphones. The attacker steals this key.

With the stolen Link Key and by spoofing the headphones' Bluetooth address, the attacker can then impersonate the headphones and connect to the user's smartphone. This grants the attacker a privileged position as a trusted peripheral, potentially allowing for device compromise and audio surveillance. The researchers also discuss the poor disclosure and patching process by some manufacturers and release tooling for users to check their devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes, expressing a mix of technical analysis, long-standing frustration, and social commentary.

A primary point of discussion was the attack mechanism itself. Users clarified the exploit's steps, emphasizing that the initial vulnerability allows an attacker to steal the Bluetooth Link Key from the headphones. Once this key is obtained, the attacker no longer needs physical access to the headphones and can impersonate them to attack the user's phone, a point that many found particularly alarming.

This technical failure fueled a broader critique of the Bluetooth ecosystem. Multiple commenters described the technology as inherently flawed, calling it "messy," "cursed," and "hacks on hacks." The situation was seen as a predictable outcome of a "race to the bottom" in manufacturing, where security is compromised for cost and convenience. The fact that premium devices like the Sony WH-1000XM5 were affected was cited as particularly egregious.

A significant portion of the conversation was a re-litigation of the smartphone headphone jack's removal. Many commenters expressed vindication and frustration, arguing that this security flaw validates their preference for wired connections. The removal of the jack was blamed on Apple's "courage" and the industry's subsequent follow-the-leader mentality, which has left consumers with fewer secure and reliable options. This led to a sub-debate on the trade-offs between the convenience of Bluetooth and the security and reliability of wired audio.

Finally, there was a discussion about the real-world implications and vendor responsibility. The vulnerabilities were seen as a significant threat, potentially for state-level espionage. Commenters criticized manufacturers like Sony for being slow to respond to the researchers, while Jabra was noted as a positive outlier. The incident was framed as a failure of corporate security practices, with some users also noting that high-profile figures like Kamala Harris have publicly avoided wireless headphones for security reasons.

## [Linux is good now](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/linux/im-brave-enough-to-say-it-linux-is-good-now-and-if-you-want-to-feel-like-you-actually-own-your-pc-make-2026-the-year-of-linux-on-your-desktop/)
**Score:** 350 | **Comments:** 290 | **ID:** 46457770

> **Article:** The article "Linux is good now" from PC Gamer argues that 2026 could be the "Year of the Linux Desktop" for users who want to feel in control of their PCs. The author contends that modern Linux distributions are no longer the complex, user-hostile systems of the past. Key improvements highlighted include the ease of installation, vast hardware compatibility, and the transformative impact of Valve's Steam Deck and Proton compatibility layer, which have made gaming on Linux a viable and often superior experience. The piece suggests that for the average user whose primary needs are a web browser and basic applications, Linux is now a polished, user-friendly, and powerful alternative to Windows, especially in light of Microsoft's recent unpopular decisions regarding Windows 10/11.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but adds significant nuance and highlights key remaining challenges. The prevailing sentiment is that Linux has reached a high level of usability, but its adoption is now less about its own flaws and more about the contrast with Microsoft's missteps with Windows 11 (e.g., bloat, ads, user-hostile changes). Many commenters share personal success stories, noting that for common tasks like web browsing and gaming (especially on the Steam Deck), the experience is seamless.

However, the discussion is tempered by recurring "edge cases" that prevent a full switch for some individuals. These are not broad failures of the OS but specific, often niche, incompatibilities. Key points of friction mentioned include:
*   **Proprietary Software & DRM:** Kernel-level anti-cheat systems in some games, specific professional software (CAD, DVR applications), and cloud services with poor Linux support (like Dropbox's lack of "online-only" files).
*   **Hardware Peripherals:** Niche or complex hardware like VR headsets, sim racing wheels, and some Bluetooth devices can still be problematic.
*   **Perceived Stability:** Some users report experiences of system instability or "rot" over time, attributing it to complex defaults (GNOME, Snap, systemd). Others counter that this is not a typical experience and that modern distros are very stable, with recovery mechanisms (like NixOS rollbacks) being easier than on Windows.

Ultimately, the consensus is that Linux is "good enough" for the vast majority of users, but the final 1% of compatibility for specialized hardware or software remains the biggest hurdle for many would-be switchers.

## [Show HN: OpenWorkers – Self-hosted Cloudflare workers in Rust](https://openworkers.com/introducing-openworkers)
**Score:** 350 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46454693

> **Project:** OpenWorkers is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to Cloudflare Workers, written in Rust. It aims to provide API compatibility with the Cloudflare Workers platform (e.g., the `fetch` handler, `Request`/`Response` objects) to allow for easy code migration and local development. The project uses a custom V8 runtime built with `rusty_v8`, which is independent of Cloudflare's actual runtime. The goal is to enable developers to run worker code on their own infrastructure, avoiding vendor lock-in and potentially reducing costs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the project, with several key themes emerging from the discussion.

There was a significant focus on the project's technical foundation and security. A primary clarification was that OpenWorkers uses a custom V8 runtime, not the official Cloudflare runtime, achieving compatibility at the API level. This led to a critical discussion about sandboxing security. Commenters emphasized that for any sandboxing solution, robust documentation proving its resistance to escape attacks is paramount. Others noted that for self-hosted environments, the security stakes are different from a multi-tenant cloud provider, and that the security of Cloudflare's runtime also relies on their rapid patching of V8 vulnerabilities.

The project's potential use cases were also debated. While some saw it as a tool for vendor lock-in avoidance and cost reduction, others suggested its most immediate value could be for local testing and development of applications destined for Cloudflare's cloud. There was also a comparison to other self-hosting solutions like Rivet and OpenFaas.

Finally, users provided concrete feature requests, including a Kubernetes deployment guide, GitHub integration for auto-deployment on push, and support for Cloudflare Workflows.

## [iOS allows alternative browser engines in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines-jp/)
**Score:** 339 | **Comments:** 270 | **ID:** 46453950

> **Article:** Apple has announced that developers can now use alternative browser engines (other than its own WebKit) for browsers in Japan. This change is a direct response to new Japanese legislation aimed at promoting competition in the digital market. The policy allows developers to build and submit browsers for the Japanese App Store that are powered by engines like Blink (used by Chrome and Edge) or Gecko (used by Firefox). This move follows a similar, but more complex, rollout in the European Union, and represents a significant shift away from Apple's long-standing requirement that all iOS browsers must use WebKit.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of Apple's move, framing it as a reluctant and minimal compliance with legal pressure rather than a genuine embrace of competition. The consensus is that Apple is deliberately making the alternative browser engine option unappealing and difficult to adopt.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Legal Pressure as the Driver:** Commenters universally agree that this change is a direct result of new laws in Japan and the EU, not a voluntary decision by Apple. They see it as a sign that regulatory intervention is necessary to force competition.
*   **Skepticism of Implementation:** Many users believe Apple is "maliciously complying" by creating onerous requirements. These include mandates for memory-safe languages, separate binaries for browser components, and strict vulnerability resolution timelines. Critics argue these rules are designed to be a logistical nightmare, making it economically unviable for companies like Mozilla or Google to port their full-featured engines just for one market.
*   **The "Monoculture" Debate:** A nuanced point is raised about whether forcing competition actually helps. One commenter warns that naive enforcement could simply lead to the entire web on iOS being powered by Google's Blink engine, creating a new monoculture and reducing the diversity of browser engines.
*   **Geographic Fragmentation and US Frustration:** There is significant frustration from US-based users who are excluded from these changes. Commenters see this as a deliberate "divide and conquer" strategy by Apple to make alternatives seem chaotic and inconvenient, thereby discouraging their adoption globally. The EU's experience, where similar rules exist but no third-party engines have shipped yet, is cited as evidence that Apple's implementation is effectively a failure.
*   **Security vs. Control:** While some users acknowledge Apple's stated security and battery life justifications, the prevailing sentiment is that these are pretexts for maintaining control over the platform and its revenue streams.

## [Cameras and Lenses (2020)](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/)
**Score:** 318 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46455872

> **Article:** The article "Cameras and Lenses" by Bartosz Ciechanowski is an interactive educational piece that explains the physics of optics and photography. It starts with the fundamental principles of light, demonstrating how a simple pinhole camera works to project an image. The article then progresses to explain the necessity and function of lenses, detailing how they gather more light and focus it to create a brighter, sharper image. Key concepts like aperture, focal length, depth of field, and the "circle of confusion" are explored using interactive diagrams that allow the reader to manipulate variables (e.g., aperture size, subject distance) and see the optical effects in real-time. The piece serves as a visually-driven, intuitive guide to the science behind how cameras capture images.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the article was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising it as a masterclass in interactive education. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Exceptional Educational Value:** Commenters lauded author Bartosz Ciechanowski for his ability to build complex mental models from the ground up. The interactive elements, particularly the one demonstrating depth of field by adjusting an aperture slider, were highlighted as being far more effective than static text for making concepts "click."
*   **The Human Element vs. AI:** Several users noted that this level of creative, intuitive, and visually rich content is something current AI/LLMs cannot produce. This sparked a brief debate, with one user arguing that the content is essentially "fact regurgitation" that an AI could replicate, though the general sentiment was that the author's unique presentation and design are a distinctly human achievement.
*   **Technical and Scientific Nuance:** A more technical sub-thread emerged where a user critiqued the common visual metaphor for electromagnetic waves (wiggling like a snake), explaining how it can create misconceptions. This led to a discussion on better ways to visualize wave propagation and superposition.
*   **Author's Productivity:** The author's prolific output of high-quality, in-depth articles was a point of admiration and curiosity, with users comparing him to other highly productive figures like Andrej Karpathy and wondering how they manage such consistent, high-level work.
*   **Minor Issues:** A few users reported technical issues with the site on Firefox, though others confirmed it worked for them, suggesting it might be an extension-related problem.

## [I rebooted my social life](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/this-might-be-oversharing)
**Score:** 315 | **Comments:** 251 | **ID:** 46453114

> **Article:** The author, James Omalley, describes his personal journey of "rebooting" his social life after feeling disconnected and lonely. He argues that while online friends and distant close friends are valuable, they cannot replace the need for a local, in-person community. He identifies the key to building such a community as finding or creating a "third space" (a place outside of home and work) centered around a shared activity or interest. He shares his own success in joining a local political party, which provided regular, low-stakes social interaction that blossomed into genuine friendships, and encourages readers to proactively seek out or start similar groups to combat modern social isolation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing their own experiences of seeking community and the challenges involved. A central theme is the modern search for "third spaces" to break the monotony of remote work and home life. Several solutions were proposed: co-working spaces as a substitute for office interaction, joining or starting clubs (like a climbing or board game club), and volunteering. There was a debate on the value of online communities, with some arguing they are a poor substitute for in-person connection due to a lack of physical presence and the potential for excessive screen time, while others defended them as valid communities. The conversation also touched on the difficulties of making friends as an adult, with advice ranging from overcoming the awkwardness of "friend-hunting" to focusing on activities where friendships can develop naturally. A poignant sub-thread addressed the difficulty of helping friends who are trapped in cycles of isolation and depression, highlighting that simply wanting to connect isn't always enough.

## [ACM Is Now Open Access](https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2026/january/acm-open-access)
**Score:** 305 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46454763

> **Article:** The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has announced a transition to a "fully open access" model for its digital library. This means that all articles published by ACM will be freely available to read for everyone, eliminating paywalls for readers. The change is framed as a move to make ACM's extensive and curated library of computer science research more accessible to all, regardless of institutional affiliation.
>
> **Discussion:** The announcement was met with a mix of praise and significant skepticism. While many commenters welcomed the removal of paywalls for readers, the dominant theme of the discussion was a critique of the new model's details and the publisher's claims.

A primary point of contention is that "open access" does not mean "free to publish." The model shifts the cost from readers to authors, who (or their institutions) must pay an Article Processing Charge (APC) of over $1000. Commenters questioned whether this fee is justified, given that peer review is done by volunteers and authors supply the final manuscript. Some argued this fee acts as a necessary gatekeeper to prevent a flood of low-quality submissions, while others saw it as a barrier for researchers without funding.

Several users challenged ACM's claim of being a unique, highly curated open-access provider, pointing out that this Author-Pays model is becoming an industry standard and that free alternatives like OpenAlex already exist. The discussion also clarified that ACM is a non-profit, unlike commercial publishers like Elsevier, and that its revenue is needed to maintain the digital library and support community activities. Finally, some commenters noted that the "free" access for individuals is limited, lacking advanced search features, and that the move will primarily benefit large institutions that can afford the APCs.

## [Meta made scam ads harder to find instead of removing them](https://sherwood.news/tech/rather-than-fully-cracking-down-on-scam-ads-meta-worked-to-make-them-harder/)
**Score:** 270 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46453582

> **Article:** A report from Sherwood News, based on a Reuters investigation, alleges that Meta has a "playbook" to fend off pressure to crack down on scam ads. Instead of removing them, Meta makes them harder for regulators and journalists to find. The strategy involves identifying the search terms used by regulators (e.g., top keywords, celebrity names) and then running those specific searches repeatedly to find and delete the fraudulent ads. This allows Meta to show it is taking action against the scams that are most visible to oversight, while the underlying problem of scam ads being served to the general public may persist.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Meta's alleged strategy, with many commenters viewing it as a deceptive, cynical, and insufficient response to a serious problem.

A central theme is the debate over whether Meta's actions constitute "cloaking" – a black-hat SEO technique used by scammers to show one thing to review bots and another to users. One commenter argues that Meta is ironically using its own sophisticated targeting tools to "cloak" its ad inventory from regulators. However, another counters that the described method of proactively searching for and deleting ads based on regulator search terms is not cloaking, but rather a targeted, reactive cleanup.

Many users express frustration that the core issue remains unaddressed: if Meta can detect these ads, why are they allowed to run in the first place? This sentiment is echoed by a commenter who draws a parallel to "Dieselgate," suggesting a deliberate effort to pass regulatory tests without fixing the underlying problem.

The discussion broadens to include:
*   **Industry-wide problem:** Several commenters point out that Google faces identical issues with phishing sites and scam ads on its platforms, suggesting this is a systemic problem in the ad-tech industry.
*   **Cynicism and lack of solutions:** There is a sense of helplessness, with commenters suggesting the only solution is to stop using Meta's products, which they acknowledge is unrealistic for most. Others call for criminal accountability for Meta's leadership.
*   **Anecdotal evidence:** Users share personal stories of being scammed by ads on Meta's platforms or having poor experiences with Google Ads, reinforcing the article's claims.
*   **Potential for corruption:** One commenter speculates that the inconsistent enforcement of ad rules (e.g., legitimate ads being rejected while scams run rampant) could be due to corruption, with certain advertisers getting preferential treatment.

## [Python numbers every programmer should know](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/python-numbers-every-programmer-should-know/)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46454470

> **Article:** The article "Python numbers every programmer should know" provides a reference guide of key performance metrics for Python's built-in data types and operations. It presents charts with concrete figures for memory usage (e.g., size of an empty list, an integer, a string) and execution time (e.g., cost of accessing a list element, appending to a list, set/dict lookups). The goal is to give programmers an intuitive, quantitative feel for the performance characteristics of the language's fundamental building blocks, helping them make more informed decisions when writing code.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a significant divide on the value of memorizing such specific performance numbers. The central debate is whether this knowledge is practical and necessary or a form of premature optimization.

Many commenters argue that these numbers are largely irrelevant for most programmers. They contend that understanding Big O complexity (e.g., knowing a dict lookup is O(1) and a list search is O(N)) is far more important than knowing the exact constant-time costs. Several users pointed out that if performance is so critical that these micro-optimizations matter, Python is likely the wrong tool for the job, and one should either use a faster language like C/Rust or push the performance-critical code into a C extension (like NumPy or PyTorch). The consensus from this camp is to profile real-world code first rather than relying on generic benchmarks.

On the other side, some defended the article's value, suggesting that while not for every programmer, these numbers help build an "implicit" or "tacit" understanding of performance that influences better design choices. They argue that Python's performance characteristics (like fast dicts) directly shape the language's idioms and popular libraries.

Other key points of discussion included:
*   **Accuracy and Context:** Commenters noted that the numbers are highly dependent on hardware, OS, and Python version, and may not be representative of production environments. Specific examples, like non-ASCII strings or M4 Max vs. Intel Mac memory usage, were cited as cases where the numbers would diverge.
*   **Potential for Misinterpretation:** Some pointed out that the article's wording could be misleading, for example, conflating the speed of membership testing with the speed of iteration.
*   **The "Leaky Abstraction" Argument:** One user argued that performance *always* matters, and even if a programmer doesn't know the numbers, the ecosystem of libraries and tools they use is built by people who do, making the knowledge indirectly relevant.

## [2025 Letter](https://danwang.co/2025-letter/)
**Score:** 236 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46454413

> **Article:** Dan Wang's "2025 Letter" is a comprehensive analysis of the geopolitical and technological competition between the United States and China. The author argues that while the US is rhetorically aggressive about a "Cold War" with China, it is failing to do the necessary preparation, particularly in building physical infrastructure. In contrast, China is quietly and effectively building the industrial and technological foundation for a future where it may be isolated from the West, especially in preparation for a potential conflict over Taiwan. The letter contrasts China's ability to "build" at a massive scale with America's bureaucratic paralysis. It also touches on the culture of Silicon Valley, critiquing its lack of self-expression while acknowledging its meritocratic (or at least, credential-based) nature, and discusses the state of AI development and the changing demographics of tech entrepreneurship.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion overwhelmingly praises Dan Wang's letter and his book, "Breakneck," describing them as balanced, insightful, and essential for understanding the US-China dynamic. Key themes from the comments include:

*   **US vs. China Competence:** A central point of agreement is Wang's critique of the US's lack of strategic preparation compared to China's focused, long-term industrial planning. One comment highlights a particularly resonant line: "Beijing has been preparing for Cold War without eagerness for waging it, while the US wants to wage a Cold War without preparing for it." The discussion often circles back to the US's inability to build large-scale infrastructure as a critical weakness.
*   **Silicon Valley Culture:** The article's observations on Silicon Valley sparked a debate. While some agreed with the critique of its "bland" corporate culture and lack of "drip," others challenged the idea that it is truly meritocratic. One commenter argued that SV simply substitutes traditional credentials (degrees) with different ones (past companies, VC connections), and that the "meritocracy" is more about access and networks than pure talent.
*   **China's Authoritarianism:** One commenter's takeaway from Wang's book was the CCP's willingness to impose immense costs on its citizens for its policy goals (e.g., Zero-COVID, One-Child Policy) and its strategic preparation for a potential decoupling from the West.
*   **Fact-Checking:** A minor point of contention arose over a statistic in the letter about the decreasing median age of Y Combinator founders. While the letter claimed it dropped to 24, a commenter questioned this, citing a recent article that the average founder age was increasing. Another user provided a source to validate Wang's claim.

## [Sony PS5 ROM keys leaked – jailbreaking could be made easier with BootROM codes](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/playstation/playstation-5-rom-keys-leaked-jailbreaking-could-be-made-easier-with-bootrom-codes)
**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46455053

> **Article:** An article from Tom's Hardware reports on the leak of PlayStation 5 ROM keys, specifically the decryption keys for the console's bootloader. The article clarifies that this is not a direct path to a full jailbreak or custom firmware. Instead, it significantly lowers the barrier for hackers by allowing them to decrypt and analyze the official bootloader. This enables a deeper understanding of the PS5's boot process, which is a critical first step in finding new vulnerabilities. The piece also notes that this is an unpatchable issue for Sony, as these keys are burned directly into the APU and cannot be changed. It draws a parallel to the infamous PS3 cryptography mistake and mentions that this leak is likely connected to previous hardware-level research presented at security conferences.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on clarifying the technical implications of the leak and speculating on its origins. The consensus is that the leak is being overhyped by media; while it's a significant development for researchers, it doesn't immediately enable piracy or a full jailbreak.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **Technical Clarification:** Commenters explain that the leak allows for decryption and study of the bootloader, which is a crucial step for finding exploits but is not an exploit in itself. One user notes that to fully compromise the console, hackers would still need to find bugs in the ROM or obtain other protected data like fuse information.
*   **Method of Leak:** Users debated how the keys were obtained. The prevailing theory is that they weren't from a breach of Sony's servers, but were extracted from the hardware itself. This was likely achieved through advanced hardware attacks like fault injection to bypass secure boot, allowing researchers to read the ROM.
*   **Hardware Security Analogy:** The security model was compared to a PC's TPM and Secure Boot, but a more accurate comparison was made to the AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) or Intel's Boot Guard, which is the hardware root of trust that runs before the main OS.
*   **Historical Context:** The discussion referenced the PS3's security failure, with one user correcting another by pointing out that Sony removed the "Other OS" (Linux) feature precisely because it was used in the first PS3 jailbreak.
*   **Speculation on Sony's Countermeasures:** A user speculated that Sony might have anticipated this by including multiple keys in the APU, with a firmware update able to switch to a new key if one was compromised. However, others questioned the practicality of this, as it would break compatibility with older firmware.

## [A website to destroy all websites](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46457784

> **Article:** The article "A website to destroy all websites" is a manifesto against the modern, algorithm-driven web (doomscrolling, engagement bait, corporate platforms). It argues for a return to the "indie web" through the creation of personal websites. The author proposes five steps to reclaim the internet: start small, reduce friction to publishing, don't worry about design, use the IndieWeb (open standards), and share what you've made. The linked website itself is a stylistic choice—a long-form, image-heavy, text-heavy page designed to force the user to slow down and read rather than skim.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the feasibility and philosophy of returning to a personal web, split between nostalgic enthusiasm and pragmatic realism. 

Aesthetics and Accessibility: Several users found the article's design inspiring and a joy to read, though others criticized the small font size and reliance on JavaScript, arguing it hindered skimming. A debate emerged here regarding whether websites *need* to function without JavaScript, with some viewing it as a necessary accessibility feature and others as an obsolete design choice.

The "Indie Web" Reality: While many expressed a desire to return to writing and publishing on personal sites, practical barriers were highlighted. Commenters noted that the hardest parts of the "Indie Web" are not the writing but the technical friction of buying domains, setting up hosting, and securing servers against bots. There was skepticism about the "Join us" step of the author's plan, noting that personal sites lack the built-in community and conversation of platforms like Reddit or Mastodon.

Nostalgia vs. Progress: A significant thread debated whether the "old web" was actually better. Some argued that while the modern web is noisy, it is also far more accessible and offers better paths to monetization for creators than the hobbyist web of the past. The consensus among realists was that while personal sites are great, the trend toward centralized, easy-to-use platforms is unlikely to reverse because the packaging (platforms) matters less to most people than the content itself.

## [The Delete Act](https://privacy.ca.gov/drop/about-drop-and-the-delete-act/)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46449694

> **Article:** The article is an official page from the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) explaining the "Delete Act" (SB 362). This legislation builds upon the existing California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) by creating a centralized mechanism for consumers to request the deletion of their personal data. Under this system, consumers can make a single deletion request to the CPPA, which will then notify all registered data brokers, requiring them to delete the consumer's data and honor future opt-out requests. The goal is to simplify the process of reclaiming one's digital privacy, which previously required individuals to contact hundreds of data brokers individually. The page notes that the centralized deletion service is scheduled to become operational by August 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive, viewing the Delete Act as a significant step forward for consumer privacy, with many commenters comparing it to Europe's GDPR but noting that its centralized, automated approach to notifying data brokers is a key innovation that could make it even more effective. A central theme is the potential for unintended consequences; users worry that a complete absence of data could lead to negative outcomes, such as failing background checks for housing or employment, similar to how having no credit history can be detrimental. There is also debate over whether major tech companies like Google and Facebook qualify as "data brokers" under the law's specific definition, which focuses on businesses that sell data collected from consumers with whom they have no direct relationship. Finally, some users speculate that this state-level legislation could pressure the federal government to enact a national privacy law, as companies may eventually prefer a single standard over complying with a patchwork of state laws.

## [Finland detains ship and its crew after critical undersea cable damaged](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/europe/finland-estonia-undersea-cable-ship-detained-intl)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46456797

> **Article:** Finland has detained a commercial ship and its crew for causing damage to a critical undersea communications cable in the Baltic Sea. This incident is part of a broader pattern of damage to infrastructure in the region, with reports of at least 10 undersea cables being damaged in the Baltic between 2023 and 2025. The article highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions in this area, which is a crucial and narrow waterway for Russian maritime access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the cause of the cable damage, the appropriate response, and the legal challenges involved. A dominant theme is the suspicion of deliberate sabotage, with many commenters immediately attributing the incident to Russia or China, viewing it as a form of hybrid warfare. However, this is countered by skepticism, with some users demanding concrete evidence of state involvement rather than lazy speculation, and others suggesting the issue could be due to poor cable design or placement in shallow, high-traffic waters.

There is a strong consensus that the response to such incidents must be more forceful to create a deterrent. Proposed solutions range from seizing and auctioning off offending vessels to more extreme measures like requiring ships to post massive bonds that would be forfeited if a cable is cut, or even military actions like mining the gulf. A key point of frustration is the perceived failure of the legal system, with commenters noting that previous cases were thrown out due to a lack of proof of intent or jurisdictional issues, leading to calls for governments to act on national security grounds outside of traditional court proceedings.

## [Children and Helical Time](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2025/12/30/children-and-helical-time/)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46452763

> **Article:** The article "Children and Helical Time" proposes that our subjective experience of time follows a logarithmic scale, where time feels longer in retrospect when we are younger. A year feels like a huge portion of a 5-year-old's life, but only a small fraction to a 50-year-old. The author visualizes this as a "helical" path where the years (the loops) get closer together as we age.

The author argues that this explains why childhood memories feel so vivid and "long"—they are packed with novel experiences that rivet our attention. As adults, routine sets in, and life speeds up. The author finds a silver lining in parenthood, suggesting that we can recapture this sense of "helical time" and novelty through "vicarious firsts"—experiencing the world again through the eyes of a child.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharp divide between those who find the article's premise relatable and those who view it as a pessimistic or limited perspective on life.

A significant portion of the comments validate the logarithmic time theory, often citing personal experience where their "best" or "longest" memories come from periods of high novelty and low obligation, such as university or early childhood. However, many counter that the decline in perceived time is not inevitable but a result of a monotonous lifestyle. These users argue that maintaining curiosity and avoiding "autopilot" routines can keep life feeling vibrant and "long" at any age.

The conversation also touches on the role of agency and socioeconomic factors. Several commenters suggest that the ability to pursue novelty is a luxury, and that for those trapped in repetitive work or financial insecurity, life naturally feels like it speeds up. Others challenge the article's timeline, noting that major life events (like marriage or having children) can create intense, vivid memories well into adulthood, regardless of the logarithmic scale. Ultimately, the debate centers on whether time perception is a biological inevitability of aging or a byproduct of how we choose to live.

## [BYD Sells 4.6M Vehicles in 2025, Meets Revised Sales Goal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 201 | **ID:** 46454977

> **Article:** This Bloomberg article reports that BYD, China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, sold 4.6 million vehicles in 2025, successfully meeting its revised annual sales target. The achievement highlights BYD's rapid growth and dominant position in the global EV market, particularly as it expands its sales beyond China's borders.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on BYD's sales figures quickly evolved into a broad debate about the state of the global automotive industry, economic competition, and geopolitical strategy. The conversation is sharply divided, with commenters viewing the news through different lenses.

A central theme is the perceived decline of Western automakers contrasted with the rise of Chinese manufacturing. Many commenters argue that BYD's success is a result of superior product quality and value, suggesting that US and European companies have become complacent and are now facing an existential threat similar to the one they faced from Japanese manufacturers in the 1970s. This view holds that Western companies are relying on protectionist tariffs to survive rather than innovating to compete.

However, this narrative is strongly contested by a second group of commenters who frame BYD's growth as an unfair, state-subsidized threat. They accuse BYD of "dumping" cars on global markets to gain market share, point to reports of stockpiling and questionable debt, and argue that China's auto industry is a strategic arm of the state that undermines Western industrial and military capacity. This perspective sees the situation not as a failure of Western capitalism, but as a necessary defense against predatory state-capitalism.

Finally, there is a more nuanced discussion about the practical realities for consumers and the broader economic context. Commenters outside of the US and EU attest to the high quality and competitiveness of Chinese EVs, noting that even American brands like Tesla manufacture their cars in China. The conversation also touches on the long-term consequences of trade barriers, with some arguing that attempts to contain China's technological progress (like chip bans) are counterproductive, only serving to spur domestic innovation and create a formidable, self-sufficient competitor.

**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 10 | **ID:** 46451124

> **Article:** The article announces the release of flow5, a specialized software tool for the aerodynamic analysis of planes and sails, to open source. The tool is described as a potential flow solver with integrated pre- and post-processing features. Its goal is to make the preliminary design of wings, planes, hydrofoils, and sails more reliable, fast, and user-friendly, particularly for designs operating at low Reynolds numbers. The source code is now available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The community's reaction was one of curiosity and positive reception, with users quickly identifying the software's value for its specific niche. The discussion centered on a few key points: clarifying the software's purpose in designing aircraft and other lifting surfaces, and praising its performance model which scales with processor speed and thread count. There was also a minor thread about the generic naming of software in the "Flow" ecosystem, with one commenter noting the name was particularly fitting. Other comments touched on its potential as a teaching tool and its lineage from a previously open-sourced sail design program.

## [Worlds largest electric ship launched by Tasmanian boatbuilder](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/02/hull-096-worlds-largest-electric-ship-battery-power-launched)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46452937

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports on the launch of the "China Zorrilla," the world's largest electric ship, built by the Tasmanian company Incat. The vessel is a 130-meter catamaran ferry designed to carry 2,200 passengers and 450 vehicles across the River Plate between Argentina and Uruguay. It is powered by a massive 40-megawatt-hour battery system, weighing 250 tonnes. The ship is designed for short, high-frequency crossings and represents a significant step in decarbonizing maritime transport for large-scale ferries.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the technical specifications, cost, and practicality of the new electric ferry, often providing more detail than the source article. Key themes include technical clarifications, economic comparisons, and practical considerations for the ship's operation.

Several users corrected or added to the technical details of the ship. One thread established that the battery weight of 250 tonnes can be compared to the ~700 tonnes of propulsion equipment (engines, fuel tanks) on a conventional vessel, representing a significant weight saving. Another user highlighted that the ship uses aluminum construction and water-jet propulsion (instead of propellers) due to its shallow-water route, details omitted from the Guardian piece.

The cost of the vessel was a major point of discussion. Users debated its reported $200 million price tag by comparing it to other projects: a much smaller electric ferry project in the Azores that was cancelled over a €35 million price, and a US project for smaller ferries costing over $700 million. The consensus was that the price for this large, one-off vessel is surprisingly reasonable.

Operational practicality was also scrutinized. One user pointed out the irony of the ship's flat roof not being covered in solar panels, but this was countered by calculations showing that on-board solar would contribute a negligible amount of energy compared to the ship's massive charging needs. The long charging time (estimated 50 hours ideal, 5-10 days realistic) was questioned, though others noted the ship is only designed for a ~50km crossing and would be recharged at the terminal. Finally, commenters expressed excitement about the quiet and smooth ride of modern electric ferries.

## [Show HN: BusterMQ, Thread-per-core NATS server in Zig with io_uring](https://bustermq.sh/)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46449812

> **Project:** BusterMQ is a high-performance, open-source NATS server implementation written in Zig. It is designed with a "thread-per-core" architecture and leverages Linux's `io_uring` for asynchronous I/O to maximize throughput and minimize latency. The project is positioned as a lightweight, fast alternative to the standard Go-based NATS server, focusing on the core, best-effort delivery NATS protocol without the Jetstream durability layer.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was polarized, with commenters split between technical appreciation for the project's performance goals and skepticism about its implementation and authorship. A central theme was the project's use of Bazel as its build system, which some praised for its suitability in monorepos, while others questioned the choice given that Zig has its own capable, built-in build system. This led to broader speculation that the project might be "AI slop" or "vibe-coded," a suspicion fueled by the single large commit, the professional-looking landing page, and the seemingly incongruous build tool choice. The author confirmed using AI assistance, which prompted further debate on the etiquette of disclosing AI involvement.

Other key points included:
*   **Performance & Architecture:** Users were interested in the thread-per-core/io_uring design and asked for benchmarks against other servers.
*   **Durability:** It was clarified that BusterMQ, like standard NATS, offers best-effort delivery and does not implement the durable Jetstream layer, a deliberate design choice.
*   **Credibility:** Commenters expressed uncertainty about the project's long-term maintenance and the author's background, highlighting the growing challenge of evaluating the provenance and reliability of new open-source projects.

## [Rust--: Rust without the borrow checker](https://github.com/buyukakyuz/rustmm)
**Score:** 115 | **Comments:** 205 | **ID:** 46453062

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for a project named "Rust--". The project's description is "Rust without the borrow checker." It appears to be a tongue-in-cheek or experimental project that proposes a version of Rust that lacks its most famous safety feature. The README is minimal, prompting one commenter to suggest a "motivation section" is needed. The project also includes a "Note for LLMs" and an unconventional "NSFW" license, adding to its satirical or provocative tone.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical and dismissive of the "Rust--" concept. The dominant sentiment is that removing the borrow checker fundamentally undermines the purpose of using Rust. Many commenters framed the project as "C++ with extra steps" or simply a memory-unsafe language, questioning its value proposition.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Purpose and Motivation:** A primary point of confusion was the project's rationale. Users questioned why someone would go to the trouble of creating a "broken" version of Rust instead of just using a different language like C++ or C if they disliked the borrow checker's constraints.
*   **Compiler and Performance:** One user asked if this would lead to faster compile times. The consensus was that it would not, as the underlying error-checking logic would likely still run, even if its results were suppressed.
*   **The Value of the Borrow Checker:** The discussion inadvertently highlighted the importance of the borrow checker. One user brought up the idea of a "borrow checker sans the compiler" as a useful tool for building alternative Rust compilers, though others debated the practicality of this.
*   **Practicality and Alternatives:** The conversation touched on related ideas, such as the "zero dynamic allocation" philosophy, with some users arguing that dynamic allocation is necessary for real-world applications like text editors.

Overall, the community treated the project as a joke or a philosophical curiosity rather than a serious tool, using it as a springboard to discuss the core principles of Rust's design.
