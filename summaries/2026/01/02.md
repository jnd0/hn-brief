# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-02

## [Why users cannot create Issues directly](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3558)
**Score:** 705 | **Comments:** 254 | **ID:** 46460319

> **Article:** The linked GitHub issue explains why the Ghostty terminal emulator project does not allow users to create issues directly. Instead, users must start a GitHub Discussion. The maintainers only create an issue once a discussion has been triaged and a well-understood, actionable item is identified. The stated goal is to ensure that the issue tracker is a clean list of work ready for contributors, filtering out the 80-90% of user reports that are typically misunderstandings, configuration errors, or environmental problems rather than actual bugs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community had a mixed but thoughtful reaction to Ghostty's policy. The general sentiment leaned towards agreement with the philosophy, but several users questioned the practical implementation and suggested simpler alternatives.

Key points of discussion included:

*   **Philosophy vs. Process:** Many commenters supported the core idea of using a filter to protect the issue tracker from noise. They argued that "Issues simply don't scale" and that this separation helps maintainers focus on actionable work. Others noted that this is similar to established software development methodologies like Basecamp's Shape Up, where work is "shaped" before it's started.
*   **Alternative Solutions:** A major theme was whether this two-step process is necessary. Skeptics argued that the same result could be achieved using tags (e.g., "needs-triage," "ready-to-work-on") or issue types within GitHub. They questioned why a separate tool (Discussions) was needed when a simple label could achieve similar filtering.
*   **The "Noise" Argument:** Proponents of the Ghostty method countered that the cultural expectation set by "Discussions first" is different from a tag. They argued that back-and-forth clarification in a dedicated Discussion keeps the eventual Issue clean and free of the "noise" from initial troubleshooting.
*   **Criticism and Evidence:** One commenter challenged GitHub to implement this as a feature, but was met with a rebuttal that there is no concrete evidence this method is more effective than the standard issue system, and that it's based solely on the maintainers' beliefs.
*   **Real-World Example:** A specific example of a memory leak investigation was raised, which was being discussed across multiple platforms (X/Twitter, Discord, and GitHub Discussions) but had not yet been promoted to an official issue. This highlighted both the policy in action and a potential frustration for users who want to see clear progress on known bugs.

## [I'm a developer for a major food delivery app](https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/)
**Score:** 556 | **Comments:** 259 | **ID:** 46461563

> **Article:** The article is a now-deleted Reddit "confession" from an anonymous user claiming to be a developer for a major food delivery app. The author alleges that the company intentionally manipulates the tipping system to maximize its own revenue at the expense of drivers. Specifically, they claim that the app's algorithms are designed to present customer tips to drivers in a way that obscures the true tip amount, and that the company uses these tips to subsidize driver pay, rather than passing them on fully. The author states they have resigned and posted this as a form of whistleblowing, acknowledging they are violating a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the confession's authenticity but largely agrees that the alleged practices are plausible within the gig economy. The central theme is the lack of verifiable evidence; many commenters dismiss the post as "fiction" or an unverified anecdote, while others argue that even without proof, it aligns with the known behavior of venture-backed tech companies.

There is a strong consensus on the exploitative nature of food delivery platforms. Users express frustration with hidden fees, inflated menu prices, and the general distrust of the in-app tipping system. Several commenters share personal anecdotes of poor service, such as orders being stuck in limbo while the restaurant waits for a driver, highlighting the systemic inefficiencies and the tendency for platforms to shift blame.

The discussion also touches on the broader economic model of the gig economy, with one user theorizing that these services only survive due to an "infinite supply of suckers" willing to work as drivers for low pay. The author's decision to post the confession after resigning was viewed as either a foolish risk or a calculated move, adding a layer of intrigue to the story's credibility. Ultimately, the community used the post as a catalyst to vent long-held suspicions about the unethical practices of food delivery apps.

## [FracturedJson](https://github.com/j-brooke/FracturedJson/wiki)
**Score:** 454 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46464235

> **Article:** FracturedJson is a tool and library for formatting JSON data into a more compact, readable, 2D "table-like" structure. It aims to improve upon standard minified JSON and verbose pretty-printed JSON by aligning keys and values in a way that is easier for humans to scan. The project is implemented in C# and TypeScript/JavaScript, with a Python wrapper also available. It supports features like comments, which are not part of the official JSON standard but are often desired for configuration files or debugging contexts.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the utility of the formatting concept, the perennial debate over comments in JSON, and implementation details. A major theme was the debate over comments in JSON. One side argued that Douglas Crockford's original exclusion was a wise decision to prevent misuse and feature creep, citing the "Hyrum's Law" principle that any exposed behavior will be depended upon. The other side found the reasoning "silly," pointing out that comments are essential for configuration files and that the fear of misuse shouldn't preclude a useful feature.

Regarding its use case, commenters saw potential in niche areas like debugging APIs or game development but were skeptical of its use for general human-readable configuration files, for which TOML or YAML are considered superior. There was a recurring joke about the difficulty of YAML, with users advising to "just say Norway." The tool's potential for LLMs was also noted, as the more compact format could reduce token counts and potentially lower API costs.

On the technical side, users immediately requested integration with standard command-line tools like `jq` and were pleased to see the CLI supports piping. A key suggestion was to create a language-independent conformance test suite to ensure consistency across the different language implementations (C#, JS, etc.). Finally, some users discussed the broader concept of "table-like" code formatting, with one sharing an experience building a similar custom formatter for XML.

## [HPV vaccination reduces oncogenic HPV16/18 prevalence from 16% to <1% in Denmark](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.27.2400820)
**Score:** 438 | **Comments:** 239 | **ID:** 46463315

> **Article:** An article in *Eurosurveillance* details the remarkable success of the HPV vaccination program in Denmark. The study shows that the prevalence of the two most oncogenic HPV types (16 and 18) has been reduced from 16% in the pre-vaccination era to less than 1% in vaccinated women by 2021. This has led to a dramatic decline in cervical cancer rates, with Denmark approaching the WHO's threshold for disease elimination.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the vaccine's effectiveness, the challenges in public health messaging, and the logistical aspects of Denmark's success.

Commenters universally praised the vaccine's impact, noting that its benefits extend beyond cervical cancer to include protection against various cancers in men (penile, rectal, nasopharyngeal). A key point of debate was the communication strategy. One user argued that public health messaging has failed men by focusing on female fertility rather than the direct, tangible risks to men, suggesting that a more direct warning about penile cancer would increase uptake.

Several threads explored the nuances and limitations of the data. While the vaccine has nearly eliminated targeted strains, some noted that non-vaccine HPV types still persist and may become more prevalent. A lengthy sub-thread addressed a flagged, anti-vaccine comment, with a moderator and other users dissecting how misleading arguments are constructed by selectively omitting data from clinical trials. This led to a broader point that public health agencies' failure to transparently communicate complex areas—such as vaccine efficacy in individuals with pre-existing infections—creates openings for misinformation.

Finally, the discussion touched on practicalities. The success in Denmark was attributed by some to its robust digital infrastructure for public health notifications, though others countered that similar results are achievable without it. There was also a side conversation about the high cost and limited insurance coverage for adults (particularly men over 26) seeking the vaccine in some countries, creating a barrier despite updated recommendations.

## [Happy Public Domain Day 2026](https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/)
**Score:** 412 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46460440

> **Article:** The article from The Public Domain Review announces that on January 1, 2026, thousands of creative works from 1930 will enter the public domain in countries with a "life plus 70 years" copyright term (like the UK and EU). This "Public Domain Day" marks the release of works whose authors died in 1955. Notable works entering the public domain include the novel "The Maltese Falcon," the film "All Quiet on the Western Front," the first appearance of the character Betty Boop, and works by authors like P.G. Wodehouse and Charlie Parker. The article serves as a celebration of this annual event, which allows these cultural artifacts to be freely copied, adapted, and shared without permission or payment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the complexities, frustrations, and idealistic aspirations of copyright law. A central theme is the confusion surrounding what exactly enters the public domain, especially for collaborative works like music. Users point out that while a composer like Charlie Parker may be deceased, the copyright for specific recordings or contributions from other living artists can keep a work protected, making it difficult for individuals to know what is and isn't free to use. This complexity leads to a cynical view that the system is nonsensical, with some advising to "just pirate it" for non-commercial projects.

The conversation also explores potential reforms to copyright. One popular idea discussed is a tiered system where copyright holders could pay increasing fees for each extension, which would allow valuable corporate IP to remain protected while freeing up less profitable works. However, another user provides a strong counter-argument: this would disadvantage independent artists whose work often only becomes popular decades after its release (citing examples like *A Game of Thrones* and *The Handmaid's Tale*), effectively allowing wealthy corporations to outlast them.

Finally, there is significant discussion on the practical implications of a work being in the public domain. Users clarify that it only means the original work is free from copyright claims; new restorations, translations, or soundtracks are still copyrightable. A major practical hurdle is that public domain status doesn't guarantee access—if a rights holder controls all existing physical copies (like original film reels), they can effectively prevent a work's distribution even if they can't sue for copyright infringement. The thread concludes with a more radical, idealistic call from some users for all works to be in the public domain immediately, arguing that current laws favor corporations over creators and stifle new art.

## [10 years of personal finances in plain text files](https://sgoel.dev/posts/10-years-of-personal-finances-in-plain-text-files/)
**Score:** 385 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46463644

> **Article:** The article "10 years of personal finances in plain text files" details the author's long-term use of a plain text accounting (PTA) system, specifically the Beancount tool, to manage their money. The author advocates for this method over traditional budgeting apps, highlighting benefits like data ownership, version control with Git, powerful search capabilities, and the ability to model complex financial instruments (like RSUs and investments) beyond simple bank transactions. The post also provides practical details on their workflow, such as using one file per year and leveraging importers to automate data entry from bank statements, concluding that the initial setup effort pays off in long-term control and insight.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely validated the author's approach, with many users sharing their own positive, long-term experiences with Beancount and similar PTA tools. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **The Power of Plain Text:** Users celebrated the core benefits of using text files for data: ownership, longevity, searchability with tools like `grep`, and the ability to version control financial history with Git.
*   **Niche but Powerful:** There was a strong consensus that this method is not for everyone. While developers and power users find it versatile for tracking everything from investments to personal metrics, the high barrier to entry—including learning double-entry bookkeeping and the command line—makes it a niche solution.
*   **Time Investment vs. Reward:** One user calculated the time spent on maintenance (60-90 hours over a decade), which sparked a debate. Most argued this was a worthwhile investment for the unparalleled financial clarity and control it provides, contrasting it with the time wasted on less meaningful activities.
*   **The Learning Curve and Ecosystem:** Newcomers acknowledged the steep initial learning curve, which involves choosing between tools (Beancount, Ledger, hledger), setting up importers, and understanding accounting principles. However, experienced users and resources like the Fava GUI frontend and community-written textbooks were highlighted as valuable support.
*   **The "FOSS Dev" Controversy:** A minor point of contention arose regarding the article's author calling themselves a "FOSS dev" while having minimal direct commits to the core Beancount repository. The community largely defended them, noting their significant contributions to the surrounding ecosystem (tutorials, importers, community engagement).

## [39th Chaos Communication Congress Videos](https://media.ccc.de/b/congress/2025)
**Score:** 334 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46464426

> **Article:** The article links to the video archive for the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3), a major annual hacker conference organized by the Chaos Computer Club. The page serves as a central hub for recordings of all talks, workshops, and events from the congress, allowing the community to catch up on presentations they may have missed. The content covers a wide range of topics typical for the event, including cybersecurity, hardware hacking, digital rights, and societal implications of technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around highlighting specific talks, debating the overall quality and political direction of the conference, and a notable controversy surrounding a canceled speaker.

A significant portion of the comments are dedicated to sharing and recommending specific presentations. Cory Doctorow's talk on "enshittification" and the geopolitical pressures on nations to adopt pro-US tech policies is widely praised for its strong analysis. Other popular recommendations include technical deep dives on hacking GPG, vulnerabilities in Bluetooth headphones, and an inspiring talk on in-house electronics manufacturing. There is also a user-submitted list of other popular selections, indicating a broad interest in topics ranging from security analysis of FreeBSD jails to fraud in public transit systems.

A more contentious thread discusses the cancellation of a talk by AI researcher Joscha Bach. The cancellation was reportedly due to the public release of private emails he exchanged with Jeffrey Epstein concerning IQ, race, and gender. While some users defended Bach, arguing that private conversations should not lead to public "cancellation" and that the discussion around his views should be open, others noted that the congress held a separate, unrecorded event to critically address the situation.

Finally, there is a recurring debate about the conference's overall quality. One user laments that the congress is "getting worse and worse," with fewer technical topics. This sentiment is immediately challenged by another user who points to the numerous highly technical talks listed in the discussion as evidence to the contrary, suggesting the perceived decline may be subjective. Another user describes the event as a "strange mix of very good tech talks and left-wing extremism," highlighting the dual nature of the content that some attendees appreciate while others find polarizing.

## [Standard Ebooks: Public Domain Day 2026 in Literature](https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026)
**Score:** 313 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46462702

> **Article:** This article from Standard Ebooks announces the works that will enter the public domain in the United States on January 1, 2026. Under US copyright law, works published in 1930 will become freely available. The article highlights several notable titles from that year, including Franz Kafka's *The Castle*, Agatha Christie's *Giant's Bread*, and Dashiell Hammett's *The Maltese Falcon*. It also serves as a call for volunteers to help digitize and format these newly available books to the project's high-quality standards.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the Standard Ebooks project for its high-quality formatting, typography, and cover art. A contributor to the project is present to answer questions, which leads to several clarifications about the project's scope and copyright law.

Key themes in the conversation include:

*   **Copyright Complexity:** Several users highlight the confusing and jurisdiction-dependent nature of copyright. One commenter provides a detailed example of how a book's public domain status can change over time and differ between countries (e.g., Canada vs. France, and changes in Canadian law affecting works like Faulkner's *As I Lay Dying*). This underscores the article's focus on US law.
*   **The Value of Curation:** A prominent comment introduces the hypothesis that as "AI slop" floods the internet, the public domain will become an increasingly valuable filter for high-quality cultural artifacts. The idea is that time is the ultimate test of quality, and a steady stream of professionally produced public domain works could satisfy a large portion of cultural consumption needs.
*   **Project Details and Appreciation:** Users express appreciation for the project's aesthetic and quality, asking about the process for sourcing book covers. There are also discussions about the practicalities of digital ownership, the difficulty of creating high-quality ebooks from scratch (even with modern OCR), and recommendations for tools that integrate Standard Ebooks into personal libraries.

## [Parental controls aren't for parents](https://beasthacker.com/til/parental-controls-arent-for-parents.html)
**Score:** 302 | **Comments:** 310 | **ID:** 46464652

> **Article:** The article "Parental controls aren't for parents" argues that digital parental control systems are fundamentally broken, designed not to genuinely protect children but to serve the business interests of tech companies. The author, a parent, details his frustrating experiences with the Nintendo Switch and various app stores. He contends that to enable basic, desired functionality (like playing Minecraft with friends), parents are forced to accept a cascade of undesirable side effects, such as exposure to unvetted app stores and the pressure to subscribe to paid online services. The core thesis is that these systems are intentionally designed to exhaust parents into submission, making them "ideal customers" who give up on restrictions and just let their kids use the devices freely.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but reframes the problem, shifting focus from corporate malice to parental responsibility and the inherent flaws of modern platforms. A central theme is the critique of parents who seek technological solutions for what is fundamentally a parenting challenge. Several commenters argue that the only truly effective method is direct, in-person supervision, though others immediately counter that this is an unrealistic luxury in a world where schoolwork and social life are deeply integrated with technology.

Many users shared specific, frustrating experiences that corroborated the author's claims, particularly regarding the notoriously poor user experience of Nintendo's account systems and the "enshittification" of streaming services like Disney+ and Hulu, which mix family-friendly and adult content with inadequate filtering. There was a strong consensus that platforms like Roblox are actively hostile to parental controls.

The conversation also branched into broader societal concerns. One commenter drew a direct line between childhoods of total parental surveillance and the current adult apathy towards privacy violations by corporations and governments. Another point of debate was the "no phone until 16" rule, with some defending it as a necessary boundary while others who experienced it firsthand described it as socially isolating. Ultimately, while the community agreed that the technical tools are inadequate, the debate centered on whether the fault lies with corporate design, parental laziness, or the complex reality of raising children in a digitally saturated world.

## [Ask HN: Who is hiring? (January 2026)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46466074)
**Score:** 222 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46466074

> **Question:** This is a standard monthly "Who is hiring?" thread on Hacker News for January 2026. The post itself is a container for hiring managers to post job listings in the comments. There are no specific questions or content in the original post text.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion consists entirely of job postings from various companies seeking to hire technical talent. The listings cover a wide range of roles, including Senior Full Stack Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Founding Engineers, and Faculty positions. The companies range from early-stage startups like Pango and Piq Energy to established tech companies like Temporal and FetLife.

Key themes across the listings include:
*   **Technology Stack:** A strong emphasis on modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, Node.js), cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes), and AI/LLM integration.
*   **Work Models:** A mix of remote-first, hybrid, and on-site (with locations including the US, Sweden, and India).
*   **Application Process:** Most posts provide specific instructions for applying, typically via a direct email address or a link to a company careers page, often asking applicants to mention Hacker News.
*   **Compensation:** Many listings include salary ranges, which is a common practice in these HN threads.

The "discussion" is limited to a few follow-up questions within comment threads, such as a candidate asking about remote work for a US-based role or inquiring about the specific technology (PHP) used by a company.

## [Clicks Communicator](https://www.clicksphone.com/en/communicator)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 144 | **ID:** 46467057

> **Article:** The article links to the product page for the "Clicks Communicator," a physical keyboard case designed for modern smartphones (initially for iPhone 15/16 series and Samsung S25). It positions itself as a revival of the BlackBerry-style physical keyboard experience, aiming to improve typing speed, accuracy, and ergonomics. The device connects via USB-C or Lightning, includes a dedicated "Command Bar" for shortcuts, and is marketed as a tool for productivity and "unplugging" from the glass screen experience. It costs around $139-$179 depending on the model.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is a mix of nostalgia, skepticism about the "digital minimalism" marketing, and technical curiosity.

There is a strong undercurrent of nostalgia for physical keyboards, with users reminiscing about BlackBerry, Palm Treo, and the efficiency of tactile typing compared to modern autocorrect-heavy glass screens. Many commenters view this as a welcome innovation in a stagnant market.

However, the discussion highlights a divide regarding the product's identity. One prominent commenter argues that the company should market the device as a serious productivity tool for *main* devices rather than leaning into the "second device" or digital detox narrative, which they view as disingenuous. Others counter that the reality of modern life (Instagram, TikTok) necessitates keeping a smartphone as the primary device, making the Clicks keyboard a secondary accessory for work.

Technically, users are interested in the hardware but express a desire for open software support. There are several requests for Linux compatibility, unlocked bootloaders for custom ROMs like GrapheneOS or LineageOS, and criticism of the limited key layout (lack of arrow keys or Ctrl) for use with coding agents or SSH sessions. Ultimately, the consensus is that while the hardware is impressive, its utility depends heavily on whether it can be integrated into a serious workflow or if it remains a niche accessory.

## [Publish (On Your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46468600

> **Article:** The article (linking to the IndieWeb concept of POSSE) outlines a strategy for taking back control of one's online presence. POSSE stands for **P**ublish (on your) **O**wn **S**ite, **S**yndicate **E**lsewhere. The core idea is to create and host content primarily on a personal website that you own and control, and then automatically or manually share ("syndicate") that content to third-party platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Mastodon. This approach contrasts with the more common PESOS (Publish Elsewhere, Syndicate to your Own Site) method, where content is created on siloed platforms and then aggregated on a personal site. POSSE ensures that the user's own site is the single source of truth and that they retain ownership of their data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely embraced the POSSE philosophy, viewing it as a return to the original, decentralized ideals of the web. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **Ownership and Control:** The primary benefit cited was regaining ownership of one's content and identity, preventing "walled gardens" like Facebook from having total control. It was noted that this model creates a "single source of truth" owned by the user.
*   **Practical Implementation:** Users shared their personal workflows. One commenter detailed their process of posting to their personal site first, then manually syndicating to Mastodon, Bluesky, and Twitter. A major pain point identified was the difficulty of automating this process, especially with APIs for platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn.
*   **Technical and Philosophical Context:** The conversation touched on the "IndieWeb" movement and its principles, such as "Friends are more important than federation." Some lamented the failure of older "semantic web" standards (RSS, microformats) to achieve mainstream adoption, which would have made this model easier to implement natively.
*   **Broader Applications:** One user extended the concept beyond social media, framing it as a way to disrupt any marketplace (e.g., a decentralized marketplace for services) by removing the central intermediary.
*   **Counterpoints and Nuance:** While the sentiment was overwhelmingly positive, a few dissenting voices emerged. One commenter argued that this nostalgia for a pre-platform internet is misguided and that one should focus on real-world, non-digital interactions. Another pointed out a practical downside: that major platforms often "down-rank" content that appears to be automated or syndicated from elsewhere, reducing its reach.

## [Marmot – A distributed SQLite server with MySQL wire compatible interface](https://github.com/maxpert/marmot)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46460676

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Marmot," a distributed SQLite server that provides a MySQL wire-compatible interface. It allows users to run SQLite in a distributed cluster, replicating changes across nodes. The project recently added DDL replication and is designed to scale applications like WordPress. It uses a gossip protocol for leaderless replication and can achieve high write throughput (6k-7k inserts/sec in a 3-node setup). The author emphasizes it is production-tested and solves the problem of scaling SQLite-based applications without migrating to a traditional RDBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly positive, with users expressing enthusiasm for the project's recent updates (specifically DDL replication) and its potential to solve scaling issues for SQLite-based applications. A key highlight is the author's confirmation that Marmot successfully runs WordPress, which users view as a major proof of concept for hosting common web applications.

Technical inquiries focused on the architecture:
*   **Sharding/Routing:** Users asked how write scaling is handled. The author responded that the current version replicates every database to every node, but future updates will allow selective replication and proxying writes to a central cluster.
*   **Consistency:** One user questioned if the gossip protocol sacrifices consistency. The author directed them to the project's limitations page.
*   **Comparison to MySQL:** A user asked for the advantages over standard MySQL with active-active replication, though this wasn't answered in the visible comments.

Other use cases mentioned include using Marmot for high-availability archiving and backing up WordPress sites to a NAS. Users also suggested integrations with tools like Litestream for S3 backups, though the author noted Marmot already supports Debezium for data streaming.

## [IPv6 just turned 30 and still hasn't taken over the world](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/31/ipv6_at_30/)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 318 | **ID:** 46465327

> **Article:** The article, published on the 30th anniversary of the IPv6 standard, examines why the protocol has not fully replaced IPv4. It argues that the narrative of IPv6 "taking over" is misleading. Instead, IPv6 has succeeded in its primary goal: absorbing the massive growth of the internet, particularly in mobile, broadband, and cloud environments, thereby preventing the collapse of the IPv4-based internet. The article frames IPv4's continued existence not as a failure of IPv6, but as a consequence of IPv6 successfully shouldering the burden of new growth, leaving IPv4 for legacy systems and specific use cases.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply divided on the practical reality and future of IPv6, with a strong undercurrent of frustration from individual and small-scale users. A central theme is the stark contrast between large-scale adoption and individual experience. While some commenters point to data showing near 50% global adoption and high IPv6 usage in large enterprises, others argue this is misleading. They contend that this adoption is largely driven by mobile carriers and large cloud providers, while fixed-line ISPs, particularly for residential customers, remain a significant barrier, often refusing to provide static IPv6 prefixes or any IPv6 support at all.

This ISP reluctance is a major pain point, especially for self-hosters and hobbyists. They describe a "nightmare" of managing dual-stack environments, dealing with applications and services that lack IPv6 support, and the unreliability of workarounds like tunnels. The lack of static, user-controlled prefixes is a recurring complaint, forcing reliance on dynamic DNS and undermining the protocol's promise of simplifying home server setup.

A significant and passionate counter-argument revolves around privacy and surveillance. One highly-upvoted commenter argues that IPv6's design, by providing a unique, traceable address for each device, is a privacy disaster that enables surveillance by governments and corporations. This view is strongly refuted by others who point out that privacy extensions exist and that ISPs can already link a household's IPv4 address to a subscriber. They argue that browser fingerprinting, not IP addresses, is the primary tracking vector, making the privacy debate around IPv6 somewhat moot. Ultimately, the discussion paints a picture of a protocol that is technically superior and essential for the internet's growth, but whose adoption is hampered by a lack of will from key infrastructure players (ISPs), creating a frustrating and fragmented experience for the technically adept users who want to use it most.

## [A confession from a mainstream food delivery app engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/s/gbrh2zxeou)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46461578

> **Article:** The article is a purported confession from an engineer at a mainstream food delivery app (likely DoorDash or a similar service). The author claims that "Priority Delivery" is a scam that does not actually speed up delivery, but merely sets a boolean flag that is ignored by the dispatch logic. The engineer alleges that the company uses psychological tactics to maximize profits, such as manipulating driver pay and hiding the true tip amount from drivers to ensure orders get accepted. The post describes a toxic work environment focused on squeezing "human assets" (drivers) and customers for every fraction of a percent of margin.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the confession's authenticity. The prevailing sentiment is that the post reads like creative writing or a "creative writing exercise" rather than a genuine leak. Several users pointed out that the technical details and the way the author describes business meetings ("sprint planning meetings where Product Managers discuss how to squeeze another 0.4% margin") feel unrealistic and overly dramatic for a corporate environment.

Regarding the specific claims, there is a split. Some users shared personal anecdotes confirming that "Priority Delivery" seems to work, noting that when they pay the fee, they no longer see "waiting on other delivery" messages and their food arrives faster and hotter. Others, however, argued that the fee is indeed a scam, or at least that the gig economy model is inherently predatory. The discussion broadened to general complaints about the gig economy, including dynamic pricing (surge pricing), tip manipulation, and the lack of regulation. A few users noted that the URL linked in the post was a Reddit link, not a direct article, and that the post was likely a duplicate of a previous submission.

**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 32 | **ID:** 46464120

> **Article:** The article "Assorted less(1) tips" provides a collection of useful command-line options and techniques for the `less` pager. Key tips include using `-R` for proper color rendering, `-X` to prevent clearing the screen on exit, and `-E` to quit automatically if the file is shorter than one screen. It also highlights interactive features like using `&` to filter lines with regexes, `s` to save the current content to a file, and the powerful `+F` command to "follow" a file or stream (similar to `tail -f`), which can be paused to allow for searching and navigation. The article also mentions the ability to customize key bindings using a `.lesskey` file.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates and expands upon the article's tips, with users sharing their personal favorites and alternatives. A major theme is the power of `less` for interactive log analysis. Users heavily endorse the `&` filter and the `s` save command, with one commenter noting the `s` command is perfect for capturing output from long-running processes without pre-committing to a log file. The `+F` (follow) mode is also highlighted as a superior alternative to `tail -f` because it allows for pausing and searching.

Several commenters shared their preferred command-line flags, such as `-X` to avoid screen clearing and the combination `-SE` (or `-SEXIER` for a memorable mnemonic). The discussion also branched out into customization (using `.lesskey` to remap keys), alternatives to `less` like `glow` (for Markdown), `moor`, and `ov`, and a useful trick for literal searching using `Ctrl-R`.

## [FreeBSD: Home NAS, part 1 – configuring ZFS mirror (RAID1)](https://rtfm.co.ua/en/freebsd-home-nas-part-1-configuring-zfs-mirror-raid1/)
**Score:** 123 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46462108

> **Article:** The article is a technical guide for setting up a home NAS using FreeBSD. It focuses specifically on configuring a ZFS mirror (equivalent to RAID1) for data redundancy. The author walks through the process from disk partitioning and ZFS pool creation to setting up datasets and configuring services. The guide is aimed at users who want to build their own storage solution using the robust combination of FreeBSD and ZFS.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a strong interest in FreeBSD and ZFS, with users exploring both the practical benefits and the philosophical motivations behind using them.

A significant portion of the conversation centers on the appeal of a "systemd-free" ecosystem. One commenter highlights that the combination of ZFS and the bhyve hypervisor on FreeBSD is a compelling alternative to Linux for those wishing to avoid systemd, viewing it as the "final piece of the puzzle" for a completely independent system.

The practical value of ZFS is a key theme. For users questioning if it's worth the hassle for a home setup, experienced users point to its superior operational feedback and data integrity features. ZFS is praised for its ability to diagnose hardware issues (like failing drives or bad cables) through checksum errors and event logs. Its snapshot capability is highlighted as a fantastic tool for backups and time-travel, allowing for cheap, frequent snapshots that can be replicated off-site. The consensus is that software RAID like ZFS is often more resilient and flexible than hardware RAID, especially for home use.

Several advanced ZFS features were discussed, demonstrating the depth of knowledge in the community. Commenters brought up the concept of Boot Environments (originating from Solaris), which allows for safe system updates and atomic rollbacks by creating isolated bootable states. This was compared to A/B updates in Android or "system generations" in NixOS. Another technical point was the recommendation to use simple boot devices and reserve ZFS for data volumes, as well as the strategy of using NVMe for metadata to accelerate performance on HDD-based arrays.

Finally, there was some meta-commentary on the state of home NAS solutions. One user questioned the continued need for such detailed, low-level configuration in 2025, suggesting a desire for more integrated, out-of-the-box systems. Another noted that TrueNAS, a popular NAS OS, has now moved to a Debian Linux base.

## [One Number I Trust: Plain-Text Accounting for a Multi-Currency Household](https://lalitm.com/post/one-number-i-trust/)
**Score:** 113 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46463407

> **Article:** The article "One Number I Trust: Plain-Text Accounting for a Multi-Currency Household" describes the author's journey to build a personal accounting system to solve a specific problem: most consumer finance apps fail to accurately track net worth when investments and multiple currencies are involved. The author details their solution using Beancount, a plain-text, double-entry accounting system.

The core of their workflow involves:
1.  **Automating Data Entry:** Writing scripts to download bank statements (primarily PDFs) and parsing the columnar text data to automatically generate Beancount transaction entries.
2.  **Handling Complexity:** Using the system's native features to manage multi-currency conversions and track investment portfolios, providing a single, accurate "number to trust" for their financial standing.
3.  **Achieving Control:** Moving away from opaque, subscription-based apps to a transparent, scriptable, and version-controlled system that offers deep visibility and control over their finances.

The author concludes that the initial time investment was well worth it for the accuracy, control, and financial motivation it provides.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion explored the article's themes, with users debating the utility of double-entry accounting, the state of personal finance software, and the practicality of such a hands-on approach.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on clarifying the purpose of **double-entry bookkeeping**. Several users explained that its primary advantage is acting as a built-in "checksum," where every transaction must balance to zero. This rigid structure makes it easy to spot data entry errors and allows for reliable auditing, as opposed to a simple spreadsheet where mistakes can be easily overlooked.

The conversation then shifted to the **challenges of existing personal finance tools**. Many users agreed that off-the-shelf software often fails those with more complex finances, particularly people dealing with multiple currencies, investment tracking, and stock portfolios. This gap in the market was cited as a key reason for seeking out more powerful, albeit technical, solutions like plain-text accounting (PTA) systems.

However, the discussion also featured a strong counterpoint on the **practicality and time investment** required. Some commenters argued that for personal finances, this level of granularity is overkill. They suggested that a simple monthly spreadsheet entry is sufficient, as the goal is to track net worth, not to run a business where every penny must be accounted for. One user shared an anecdote of being advised to "make more money" rather than meticulously tracking every small expense.

Finally, there were practical discussions about the **workflows and tools** involved. Users shared alternatives for budgeting (like YNAB and its FOSS counterpart Actual Budget) and discussed the challenges of automating data import. The difficulty of parsing "obfuscated" PDFs from banks was a specific technical hurdle mentioned, with users suggesting tools like Tabula as a workaround.

## [Going immutable on macOS, using Nix-Darwin](https://carette.xyz/posts/going_immutable_macos/)
**Score:** 108 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46462719

> **Article:** The article "Going immutable on macOS, using Nix-Darwin" details the author's journey in adopting a declarative, immutable configuration for their macOS environment. The author contrasts the traditional, manual setup of a Mac (installing apps, configuring settings, managing dotfiles) with the Nix-based approach. Using Nix and nix-darwin, the entire system state—including applications, system settings, and shell configurations—is defined in a single configuration file. This allows for a fully reproducible setup, where a new machine can be configured identically with a single command. The author highlights benefits like atomic updates, easy rollbacks, and the elimination of manual "drift" between machines, ultimately framing it as a powerful solution for developers seeking consistency and reliability in their environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a strong divide between those who find Nix's complexity a worthwhile investment and those who see it as an unnecessary hurdle. The primary benefits cited by proponents are the "holy grail" of a fully reproducible system, which dramatically simplifies onboarding new machines and ensures environment consistency, eliminating the versioning conflicts and "dependency hell" common with other package managers. For these users, the initial time investment pays off through long-term peace of mind and saved debugging time.

Conversely, several users argue that the steep learning curve and setup time are not justified, especially for those who don't frequently change hardware. They find simpler solutions like Brewfiles and shell scripts to be "more than sufficient" for their needs. A recurring theme is the trade-off between debugging Nix itself versus debugging random environment issues; proponents prefer the former as it's more predictable and searchable. Practical concerns were also raised, with some users reporting that nix-darwin can be fragile during macOS major version updates, while others stated they have experienced minimal issues. The conversation also branched into related topics like using Nix for development environments (e.g., per-project flakes) and comparisons with immutable Linux distributions like Fedora Silverblue.

## [A small collection of text-only websites](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/a-small-collection-of-text-only-websites/)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46463635

> **Article:** The article "A small collection of text-only websites" presents a curated list of websites that prioritize content over presentation by offering plain text or minimalist versions. Examples include Daring Fireball's `.text` view, NPR's text-only site, and the historically stable Berkshire Hathaway website. The author celebrates the simplicity, speed, and accessibility of this approach, contrasting it with the often bloated and ad-heavy nature of the modern web. The post serves as a showcase of "naked" web design principles.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded positively to the post, largely agreeing that text-only or minimalist websites offer a superior user experience. The discussion expanded on the original article in several key areas:

*   **Additional Examples:** Users contributed several notable text-only sites that were missing from the article, most prominently NPR (`text.npr.org`) and CNN (`lite.cnn.com`). Others mentioned the `.text` extension on Daring Fireball and the minimalist design of `berkshirehathaway.com`.
*   **Historical Context:** Commenters drew parallels to the past. One user recalled that during the 9/11 attacks, CNN had to switch to a text-only version to handle traffic, while another noted the decline of "printer-friendly" versions of websites, which served a similar function of stripping away non-essential elements.
*   **Technical Implementation:** A developer shared a practical approach of serializing view-models into `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.txt` formats for power users, arguing that this forces cleaner data architecture. Another user suggested the `.md` (Markdown) extension as a good option for content-heavy pages.
*   **Broader Philosophy and Humor:** The conversation touched on related protocols like Gemini and Gopher, which are inherently text-based. A humorous comment debated the strict "rules" of text-only sites (e.g., column width, emojis, ASCII art), while another user critiqued a linked "text-only" list for actually containing minimally styled HTML/CSS rather than being truly plain text.
