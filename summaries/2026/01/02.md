# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-02

## [Linux is good now](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/linux/im-brave-enough-to-say-it-linux-is-good-now-and-if-you-want-to-feel-like-you-actually-own-your-pc-make-2026-the-year-of-linux-on-your-desktop/)
**Score:** 688 | **Comments:** 554 | **ID:** 46457770

> **Article:** The article, titled "Linux is good now," argues that 2026 could be the "Year of the Linux Desktop" for users who want to feel in control of their PC. The author points to the growing maturity of the Linux gaming ecosystem, driven by tools like Steam's Proton, and a shift in mainstream perception. The piece suggests that for many users, especially those who primarily use a browser, the experience is now seamless and a viable, often superior, alternative to Windows, particularly in light of Microsoft's recent unpopular decisions regarding user experience and privacy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but adds significant nuance, centering on the trade-offs between Linux's growing maturity and its remaining friction points. The consensus is that while Linux is now genuinely good for gaming and general use, its adoption is often hindered by specific edge cases and the user's own familiarity with other systems.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **The "Windows is the problem, not Linux" argument:** Many commenters frame the switch not as Linux becoming perfect, but as Windows becoming more frustrating due to intrusive behavior and bloat. The sentiment is that the "rough edges" of a Linux distribution like Bazzite are now more tolerable than Microsoft's self-sabotage.
*   **The persistence of "edge cases":** A major counterpoint is that while Linux works for 99% of tasks, the 1% where it fails can be a complete blocker. Examples cited include kernel-level anti-cheat in games, specific professional software (CAD, DVRs), Dropbox's lack of "online-only" sync, and hardware incompatibilities (VR headsets, sim wheels, Bluetooth).
*   **The "familiarity penalty":** Several users argue that Windows isn't necessarily less buggy or more consistent than modern Linux, but that users have simply learned to navigate its specific quirks. The perceived difficulty of Linux is often a "switching cost" in time and effort to learn a new system.
*   **Distro choice and stability:** The debate over Linux's perceived "flakiness" is attributed to specific choices rather than the OS itself. Commenters recommend avoiding heavy defaults like Snap, using stable distributions (Debian, Ubuntu LTS), or immutable systems (NixOS) that offer easy rollbacks to recover from breakages.
*   **The future is mobile integration:** One user notes that the "Year of the Linux Desktop" goalposts have moved, and the real challenge is now achieving the seamless phone/tablet/laptop integration that Apple and Google offer.

## [A website to destroy all websites](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)
**Score:** 486 | **Comments:** 261 | **ID:** 46457784

> **Article:** The article "A website to destroy all websites" is a manifesto advocating for a return to the personal, independent web. The author argues that the modern internet, dominated by algorithmic feeds and corporate platforms, has become a tool for distraction and consumption rather than connection and creation. To "destroy" this dominant model, the author proposes building a "personal web" based on five principles: start small, reduce friction to publishing, don't worry about design, use the IndieWeb (a set of technologies like Webmentions for cross-site conversations), and share what you've made. The article itself is presented in a unique, artistic style with small fonts and integrated images, designed to encourage slow, deliberate reading rather than skimming.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was polarized, centering on the feasibility of the author's vision and the nostalgic versus practical nature of the "old web."

A primary point of contention was the article's own technical and design choices. Several users noted that the site fails without JavaScript and uses a font size that is difficult to read, viewing these as hypocritical flaws. However, defenders argued that these were intentional artistic decisions to force users to slow down and engage with the content, rather than skim, and that browser zoom is an acceptable workaround.

The conversation then broadened to a debate on the practicality and appeal of personal websites versus modern platforms. One side argued that the "old web" is gone for good reasons: the technical barriers (security, hosting) are too high for the average person, and modern platforms offer far greater ease of use, distribution, and potential for monetization. The counter-argument was that these platforms are not inevitable; people successfully created personal sites on services like Geocities and MySpace in the past, and the real barrier is a lack of a cultural catalyst and easy-to-use hosting solutions, not an inherent inability for non-technical people.

Finally, a recurring theme was a critique of the author's proposed solution. While many appreciated the sentiment, some felt the "IndieWeb" approach is too fragmented to create a true community, lacking the centralization of platforms like Reddit or Mastodon. Others pointed out that the core problem isn't just the packaging but the content itself, and that one can still create "fun, small websites" today if they choose to.

## [Bluetooth Headphone Jacking: A Key to Your Phone [video]](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-bluetooth-headphone-jacking-a-key-to-your-phone)
**Score:** 475 | **Comments:** 172 | **ID:** 46453204

> **Article:** The linked content is a video presentation from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3) detailing severe security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth headphones and peripherals that use SoCs from the manufacturer Airoha. The researchers demonstrate a multi-step attack that allows an attacker in physical proximity to silently connect to a device, dump its firmware via an unauthenticated protocol (RACE), and extract sensitive data. Crucially, this includes the Bluetooth Link Keys for all previously paired devices. With this key, an attacker can impersonate the headphones to a victim's phone, gaining a trusted connection to exfiltrate data or execute commands without needing physical access to the headphones again. The presentation criticizes Airoha and several major manufacturers (Sony, Marshall, Jabra) for their handling of the vulnerabilities and releases tooling for users to check their devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the severity of the exploit, the ongoing debate over the removal of the headphone jack, and the general state of Bluetooth technology.

Many commenters expressed alarm at the technical details of the attack, particularly the "four-step" process of gaining a persistent, trusted connection to a phone by stealing keys from the headphones. The vulnerability was seen as a significant threat, with some noting that it validates the security concerns of high-profile individuals like Kamala Harris, who reportedly avoids wireless headphones. There was also criticism directed at manufacturers like Sony for being slow to patch and for the general "race to the bottom" in hardware security.

A significant portion of the discussion pivoted to the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, a change pioneered by Apple. Commenters debated whether this move was a "courageous" step toward the future or a user-hostile decision that forced people toward less secure wireless options. While some argued that wired connections are inherently more secure and reliable, others acknowledged the convenience of Bluetooth and the availability of USB-C DACs as an alternative.

Finally, there was a broader sentiment that Bluetooth is a fundamentally "messy" and insecure standard, with some users expressing long-standing skepticism. The incident was seen as another example of the technology's inherent flaws, with one commenter noting the irony that the exploit could also be used to enable greater user control and customization (e.g., on Linux), turning a security vulnerability into a potential feature.

## [Show HN: OpenWorkers – Self-hosted Cloudflare workers in Rust](https://openworkers.com/introducing-openworkers)
**Score:** 420 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46454693

> **Project:** OpenWorkers is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to Cloudflare Workers. Written in Rust, it uses a custom V8 runtime (`rusty_v8`) to provide API compatibility with the Cloudflare Workers environment (e.g., `fetch` handlers, `Request`/`Response` objects). The goal is to allow developers to run worker code locally or on their own infrastructure without vendor lock-in, while using a familiar syntax.

## [Cameras and Lenses (2020)](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/)
**Score:** 408 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46455872

> **Article:** The article "Cameras and Lenses" by Bartosz Ciechanowski is an interactive, visual explainer on the physics of optics and photography. It builds a comprehensive mental model of how cameras work, starting from the fundamental principles of light and progressing to complex concepts. The piece uses interactive diagrams to illustrate topics such as the pinhole camera, how lenses bend light (refraction), the formation of images, depth of field, and the circle of confusion. The goal is to make these concepts intuitive and visually clear, moving from a simple "bucket of photons" to a sophisticated lens system.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the article as a masterclass in interactive education. The key themes are:

*   **Praise for the Author and Format:** Commenters consistently laud Bartosz Ciechanowski's work for its exceptional quality. The interactive, visual approach is highlighted as being far more effective than static text for building a deep understanding of complex topics. Many express a desire to support the author financially.
*   **Technical and Pedagogical Nuance:** A detailed discussion emerges about the accuracy of visualizing electromagnetic waves. One user points out the common "sinusoidal snake" representation is misleading and can create incorrect mental models, sparking a conversation about better ways to illustrate wave propagation and superposition.
*   **Productivity and Human vs. AI Creation:** The author's high productivity and ability to produce such deep, creative work is a point of admiration. This leads to a brief debate on whether such content is a benchmark for AI, with most agreeing that the unique insight and interactive design are beyond the current capabilities of LLMs.
*   **Minor Issues and Comparisons:** A few users noted technical issues (though these seemed isolated to specific browser setups), and others compared the article's quality to other famous explainers like 3Blue1Brown's videos.

## [I rebooted my social life](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/this-might-be-oversharing)
**Score:** 394 | **Comments:** 296 | **ID:** 46453114

> **Article:** The author describes a personal crisis of loneliness and social isolation after moving to a new city and working remotely. He realized that while he had close friends scattered elsewhere and online acquaintances, he lacked a local "community" – a group of people for casual, spontaneous, and supportive interaction. He outlines his plan to "reboot" his social life by intentionally joining local groups (like a running club and board game cafe) and forcing himself into low-stakes, regular social situations. The article is a call to action for others feeling similarly adrift, arguing that building community requires proactive effort, not passive waiting.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the author's premise, with users sharing their own strategies for combating isolation, particularly in the context of remote work. A dominant theme is the concept of the "third space" – environments outside of home and work – with users mentioning co-working spaces, game shops, and volunteering as effective solutions. Many commenters emphasize the importance of "activity hunting" over "friend hunting," suggesting that friendships form naturally as a byproduct of shared, regular activities like sports, classes, or clubs. The "build it yourself" approach is also celebrated, with users sharing success stories of starting clubs that then inspired others.

However, the discussion also explores the difficulties of this process. Some express deep skepticism about the superficiality of "friend-hunting" in adulthood, while others describe getting stuck in monotonous social circles (e.g., "STEM nerds who only talk shop"). A poignant sub-thread addresses the challenge of helping friends who are trapped in cycles of depression and isolation, highlighting that the desire to socialize must often come from within. The limitations of online-only friendships are also debated, with a consensus that while valuable, they often fail to replace the need for in-person connection and can contribute to screen fatigue.

## [Finland detains ship and its crew after critical undersea cable damaged](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/europe/finland-estonia-undersea-cable-ship-detained-intl)
**Score:** 390 | **Comments:** 372 | **ID:** 46456797

> **Article:** A Finnish investigation has detained a ship and its crew for questioning after a critical undersea data cable connecting Finland and Estonia was damaged. The incident, which occurred on New Year's Day, is part of a pattern of recent damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. Finnish authorities have not publicly confirmed the cause of the damage but are treating the incident as a potential act of sabotage, launching a criminal investigation into potential "serious vandalism." This event follows other recent cable cuts in the region, which have heightened tensions and suspicion towards vessels originating from or traveling to Russia.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by skepticism towards the effectiveness of the legal system and a strong desire for more forceful deterrents against these incidents. Many commenters express frustration that previous cases involving damaged cables were dismissed due to a lack of proven intent or jurisdictional issues. This leads to calls for alternative measures, such as seizing and auctioning offending vessels, requiring exorbitant financial bonds for ships passing through sensitive areas, or even more aggressive actions like blockades or military force.

A central theme is the debate over culpability. While many users immediately assume Russian state involvement, others caution that this is difficult to prove in court without concrete evidence linking the ship's crew or owners to a state-sponsored act of sabotage. The discussion highlights the complexity of modern maritime operations, where a ship's flag, owner, charterer, and recent ports of call can all be from different nations, making it hard to label a vessel as definitively "Russian." The geopolitical context is also analyzed, with users noting the strategic importance of the Baltic Sea as Russia's only warm-water access to the Atlantic and a potential chokepoint in any future conflict. Finally, some users point out that the shallow nature of the Baltic Sea may make cables inherently more vulnerable to accidental damage from anchors, questioning whether all incidents are malicious.

## [iOS allows alternative browser engines in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines-jp/)
**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 341 | **ID:** 46453950

> **Article:** Apple has announced that developers can now use alternative browser engines (like Blink from Chrome or Gecko from Firefox) for their browsers in Japan, instead of being forced to use Apple's WebKit. This change is a direct response to new Japanese regulations aimed at promoting competition in the digital market. The policy applies to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, and includes specific technical and security requirements for these alternative engines, such as using memory-safe languages and adhering to vulnerability disclosure standards. This move follows a similar rollout in the European Union, also driven by regulatory pressure (the Digital Markets Act).
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of Apple's move, viewing it as a reluctant compliance with regulation rather than a genuine embrace of competition. The consensus is that Apple is deliberately making the process difficult to discourage developers.

Key themes include:

*   **Regulatory Force vs. Goodwill:** Commenters universally agree that this is a reaction to Japanese and EU laws, not a voluntary decision by Apple. They point out that Apple is only making these changes in regions where it is legally forced to do so.

*   **Hostile Implementation:** Many argue that Apple is complying with the letter of the law but not the spirit. The requirements are described as "onerous," and commenters point to Apple's history of creating complex rules, bad APIs, and overzealous enforcement to stifle competition. One user notes that even in the EU where this was previously announced, no major third-party browsers have shipped their own engines, suggesting the barriers are too high.

*   **The "Monoculture" Concern:** A recurring point is the fear that forcing competition could ironically lead to a web engine monoculture, with Google's Blink dominating everywhere, similar to its dominance on desktop. This raises concerns about the health of the web ecosystem.

*   **Apple's Justification:** Some users acknowledge Apple's stated reasons for keeping WebKit (security, battery life, standardization) but others dismiss these as a cover for anti-competitive motives. The memory-safety requirement for third-party engines was highlighted, with users questioning if Apple's own WebKit (written in C++) would meet the same standard.

*   **Geographic Fragmentation:** There is significant frustration from US-based users who don't have these options. Commenters theorize that Apple is using this geographic fragmentation as a deliberate strategy to make alternative app stores and browsers a logistical and legal nightmare, thereby preserving the App Store's dominance.

*   **Practical Viability:** The general sentiment is that a usable, full-featured Firefox or Chrome on iOS is still a long way off, if it ever arrives. The environment is seen as too hostile for major companies to invest the resources required to port and maintain their engines, especially for a limited market like Japan.

## [Python numbers every programmer should know](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/python-numbers-every-programmer-should-know/)
**Score:** 334 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46454470

> **Article:** The article "Python numbers every programmer should know" presents a collection of benchmarked performance metrics for Python operations. It covers memory usage (e.g., size of an empty list, an integer, a string), and execution speed for common tasks (e.g., dictionary lookups, list comprehensions, string concatenation). The goal is to provide concrete, order-of-magnitude figures that help developers build an intuitive understanding of the performance characteristics of Python's built-in data structures and operations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees that the article is a useful reference but challenges the premise that these specific numbers are essential knowledge for "every programmer." The conversation revolves around a few key themes:

*   **Context is Crucial:** Commenters argue that this level of micro-optimization is only relevant for "serious" Python developers working on performance-critical applications. For general scripting or high-level application logic, Python is often chosen specifically because developers *don't* need to know these numbers.
*   **Pragmatism Over Memorization:** A recurring point is that it's more effective to understand general principles (like time/space complexity) and to use profiling tools to find real-world bottlenecks, rather than memorizing specific benchmarks. When performance does become an issue, the consensus is to push the critical code into a faster, compiled language (like C or Rust) rather than trying to micro-optimize in pure Python.
*   **Accuracy and Nuance:** Several users pointed out that the numbers are not absolute; they vary significantly with hardware, Python version, and object specifics (e.g., non-ASCII strings). Others corrected specific claims, such as clarifying that list *iteration* is fast, while membership testing is slow.
*   **The "Leaky Abstraction" Argument:** One counterpoint argued that even if a programmer doesn't need the numbers explicitly, understanding them is valuable. This knowledge informs better API design, explains why certain idioms are preferred (e.g., f-strings over repeated concatenation), and helps developers understand the performance implications of the libraries they use.

## [ACM Is Now Open Access](https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2026/january/acm-open-access)
**Score:** 322 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46454763

> **Article:** The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) announced that its Digital Library is now fully Open Access. This means that all research articles published by ACM are freely available to read and download by anyone, without a subscription. The move is presented as a major step towards making computer science knowledge more accessible globally. However, the article clarifies that the model shifts the cost from readers to authors. Institutions participating in the "ACM Open" initiative will have publishing costs covered, but authors from non-participating institutions will be required to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs) to publish their work, unless they qualify for a waiver.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the ACM's announcement is mixed, with most commenters expressing skepticism about the "open" nature of the new model. The primary point of contention is that while the content is free for readers, authors must pay significant fees (APCs of over $1000) to publish. Many argue this is not true open access but rather a shift to an Author-Pays model, which could create barriers for researchers without institutional funding.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Critique of the APC Model:** Commenters question the justification for the high fees, noting that peer review is done by volunteers and that ACM is a non-profit, unlike commercial publishers like Elsevier. There is suspicion that the fee is primarily a "gate" to prevent an overwhelming number of low-quality submissions.
*   **Defense of ACM's Costs:** A counterpoint from an ACM volunteer argues that the fees are necessary to support the "hidden" costs of the ecosystem, such as maintaining the digital library infrastructure, long-term archiving, plagiarism detection, and supporting community activities. They stress that ACM is not a for-profit entity and uses its revenue to fund the field.
*   **Alternative Resources:** In response to paywalled metadata and other limitations, users pointed to free, alternative databases like OpenAlex, which provides comprehensive scholarly metadata without charge.
*   **Broader Context:** Some users discussed the implications for other publishers and noted that this model is becoming an industry trend. Others raised concerns about the potential for this content to be primarily used for training Large Language Models (LLMs) rather than being read by humans, though it was noted that much of this research is already available on arXiv.

## [2025 Letter](https://danwang.co/2025-letter/)
**Score:** 305 | **Comments:** 210 | **ID:** 46454413

> **Article:** Dan Wang's "2025 Letter" is a comprehensive annual review contrasting the United States and China. The central thesis is that China is characterized by "hard" infrastructure and a disciplined, long-term state capacity, enabling it to build rapidly and prepare for geopolitical isolation. In contrast, the US is defined by "soft" infrastructure—dynamic software, culture, and finance—but is hampered by regulatory gridlock and an inability to execute large-scale physical projects. Wang explores this dichotomy across various domains, including AI development (where China's hardware constraints are forcing efficiency), the cultural dynamics of Silicon Valley, and the broader geopolitical posturing of both nations. The letter argues that while the US excels in innovation and culture, its lack of physical construction capability is a critical vulnerability in a world of increasing competition.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with many commenters praising the article as a balanced and insightful analysis of the US-China dynamic. Several users specifically recommended the author's book, "Breakneck," for a deeper dive into the subject. Key themes from the conversation included:

*   **Geopolitical Strategy:** A frequently quoted line from the article—"Beijing has been preparing for Cold War without eagerness for waging it, while the US wants to wage a Cold War without preparing for it"—resonated strongly. Users debated the US's lack of a clear strategy for manufacturing and its relationship with China.
*   **Critique of Silicon Valley Culture:** While some appreciated the article's affectionate portrayal of the Bay Area's intellectual vibrancy, others found it to be a "puff piece." A significant counter-argument was that Silicon Valley is not truly meritocratic but is instead driven by credentialism (based on which companies you've worked for) and networking.
*   **Infrastructure as a Differentiator:** The core theme of "hard" vs. "soft" infrastructure was a major point of agreement, with commenters seeing it as the key differentiator in the AI race and overall national competitiveness.
*   **Minor Disagreements:** A few points of contention arose, such as a debate over whether tech titans like Elon Musk are genuinely funny, and a question about the accuracy of the article's claim that the median age of Y Combinator founders has decreased.

## [Meta made scam ads harder to find instead of removing them](https://sherwood.news/tech/rather-than-fully-cracking-down-on-scam-ads-meta-worked-to-make-them-harder/)
**Score:** 299 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46453582

> **Article:** An article from Sherwood News, based on a Reuters investigation, alleges that Meta has developed a "playbook" to fend off regulatory pressure regarding scam ads on its platforms. Instead of proactively removing all fraudulent advertisements, Meta reportedly focused its efforts on making them harder for regulators and journalists to find. The strategy involved identifying the specific search terms and celebrity names used by Japanese regulators to find scam ads, then running those same searches internally to delete only the ads that were discovered. This allowed Meta to claim it was taking action while leaving much of the fraudulent content on the platform, invisible to the specific search methods used by oversight bodies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Meta's alleged strategy, with many commenters viewing it as a cynical and deceptive practice. A central theme is the profound irony of Meta, a company that builds AI to detect "cloaking" (showing different content to review bots and users), allegedly using similar techniques against regulators. One commenter described it as a "Dieselgate for Meta," drawing a parallel to the Volkswagen emissions scandal.

However, there was some debate about the specifics. One user argued the article provided no evidence Meta was lying, while another clarified that the strategy wasn't cloaking in the technical sense, but rather a targeted deletion effort based on the known search patterns of regulators.

The conversation broadened to include:
*   **Industry-wide problem:** Several users pointed out that Google faces identical issues with scam ads and phishing sites, suggesting the problem is endemic to the ad-tech industry.
*   **Systemic failures:** Commenters shared personal anecdotes of being scammed by Instagram ads or having legitimate ads rejected for unclear reasons, leading to speculation that either corrupt employees are involved or the system is fundamentally broken.
*   **Lack of accountability:** There was a strong sense of frustration with the lack of consequences for Meta, with commenters concluding that the company's immense profitability and jurisdictional protections prevent meaningful action.
*   **Proposed solutions:** Suggestions ranged from the simple ("Don't use Meta") to inquiring about new regulatory frameworks, like Australia's, that might force companies to change their behavior.

## [I'm a developer for a major food delivery app](https://old.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/)
**Score:** 253 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46461563

> **Article:** The article is an anonymous "confession" posted to Reddit by a self-described developer for a major food delivery app. The author claims that the company intentionally manipulates the tipping system to maximize its own revenue at the expense of drivers. Specifically, they allege that the app's algorithm withholds tip information from drivers when presenting them with a new order, preventing drivers from using the tip amount as a factor in deciding whether to accept a job. The author states they have lost all morale and have put in their two weeks' notice, posting anonymously from a burner device due to a fear of legal repercussions from their NDA.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the confession's authenticity but largely agrees that the described business practices are plausible. The central debate revolves around whether the post is genuine evidence or simply "fiction." Many commenters argue that while the post itself is unverified, it aligns perfectly with the known behavior of venture-backed tech companies, which often prioritize growth and profit over ethical treatment of workers. The core allegation—that companies use tips to subsidize driver pay and manipulate driver behavior—is widely accepted as a likely industry standard.

Beyond the specific claim, the conversation broadens to a general critique of the food delivery model. Commenters share personal anecdotes of poor service, such as orders being stuck in "preparing" status while the restaurant waits for a driver, and express distrust in the entire system. A recurring theme is the dehumanization of gig workers, with one commenter noting that the term "human assets" is just a slightly more blunt version of the common corporate euphemism "human resources." The consensus is that the entire ecosystem is built on exploiting an "infinite supply of suckers" willing to work as drivers, and that consumers who want to ensure their tip goes to the worker should do so in cash.

## [Sony PS5 ROM keys leaked – jailbreaking could be made easier with BootROM codes](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/playstation/playstation-5-rom-keys-leaked-jailbreaking-could-be-made-easier-with-bootrom-codes)
**Score:** 252 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46455053

> **Article:** An article from Tom's Hardware reports on the leak of PlayStation 5 ROM keys, specifically the decryption keys for the console's bootloader. These keys are burned into the AMD APU and are fundamental to the console's secure boot process. The leak, attributed to research by "The Cybersec Guru," is significant because it allows hackers to decrypt and analyze the PS5's bootloader, which is normally encrypted and inaccessible. This provides a much deeper understanding of the console's security architecture. However, the article and discussion clarify that this is not a "magic bullet" for a full jailbreak. It is a powerful research tool that simplifies a major hurdle, but further exploits are still needed to compromise the system. The keys themselves are considered unpatchable as they are physically part of the APU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion provides significant nuance and correction to the article's claims. The consensus is that while the leak is a major development for researchers, it does not immediately enable piracy or a full jailbreak. Key points from the discussion include:

*   **Clarification of Impact:** The primary benefit of the leak is that it allows hackers to decrypt and study the official bootloader. This enables them to understand the system's inner workings, which is a crucial first step, but it doesn't provide a direct path to running unsigned code. As one commenter put it, it "would just allow further study."

*   **Technical Nature of the Leak:** Users clarify that these are *decryption* keys, which must be present on every console for it to function. The leak likely resulted from a sophisticated hardware-level compromise, such as using fault injection to bypass security and extract the keys from the APU, rather than a simple server breach at Sony.

*   **Correction on Unpatchability:** A key point of debate is the claim that the issue is "unpatchable." One user speculates that Sony could have used eFuse technology to allow the APU to switch to a backup key if the primary one is compromised. However, others question the practicality of this, as it would require all software to be signed with the new key, potentially breaking compatibility.

*   **Context and History:** Commenters drew parallels to past console hacking scenes. The PS3's famous security failure (where Sony reused a static key) was mentioned, as was the fact that Sony removed the "Other OS" (Linux) feature from the PS3 precisely because it was a vector for the first jailbreak, correcting a user who thought keeping it would have prevented hacks.

*   **Technical Details:** The discussion also touched on how the keys were likely extracted (e.g., "chip-off" or more advanced fault injection with an SPI emulator) and what these keys are analogous to on a PC (the hardware root of trust, like Intel's Boot Guard, which runs before the OS and secure boot).

## [BYD Sells 4.6M Vehicles in 2025, Meets Revised Sales Goal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 359 | **ID:** 46454977

> **Article:** Bloomberg reports that Chinese automaker BYD sold 4.6 million vehicles in 2025, successfully meeting its revised sales target. The article frames this achievement within the context of intense competition in the Chinese domestic market and increasing trade barriers erected by Western nations to protect their own industries. It highlights BYD's continued growth as a dominant force in the global electric vehicle sector.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted and often contentious view of BYD's success and its implications. The conversation is split between acknowledging BYD's manufacturing prowess and viewing it as a geopolitical and economic threat.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the nature of China's industrial model. One side argues that BYD's success is a natural outcome of fierce domestic competition, contrasting it with a perceived stagnation and reliance on protectionism in the West. The other side counters that BYD's growth is fueled by massive state subsidies and a "dumping" strategy aimed at crippling foreign competitors, with some commenters pointing to reports of excess inventory and suspicious financials as evidence of an unsustainable "Evergrande business model."

The discussion also broadens into a geopolitical analysis. Several users frame the rise of the Chinese auto industry as a direct threat to Western military-industrial capacity, arguing that the loss of a robust automotive manufacturing base would cripple the West's ability to sustain a major conflict. This is contrasted with a more consumer-focused perspective, where commenters outside of the US and EU express surprise at the dominance and quality of Chinese cars in the rest of the world, with some sharing personal experiences of BYD's value proposition compared to Western brands like Tesla and Audi.

Finally, the conversation touches on the perceived failures of Western industrial policy. Commenters criticize US and EU automakers for being slow to innovate and overly reliant on lobbying and tariffs rather than competition. The chip ban on China is debated, with some seeing it as a short-sighted policy that will ultimately backfire by forcing China to develop its own advanced capabilities, much like the Soviet Union did with the atomic bomb.

## [Why users cannot create Issues directly](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3558)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46460319

> **Article:** The linked GitHub issue is a policy document explaining why the Ghostty terminal emulator project does not allow users to create issues directly. Instead, users must start with a GitHub Discussion. The maintainers only convert a discussion into an issue once it has been thoroughly vetted and is a "well-understood, actionable item." The stated goal is to ensure that the issue tracker is a clean, high-signal list of work ready for contributors, reducing noise and the time maintainers spend on user support, configuration errors, and environmental problems that masquerade as bugs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates Ghostty's approach, framing it as a pragmatic solution to the universal problem of issue tracker noise. The core debate centers on whether this process is a genuine improvement or simply a different workflow for the same triage effort.

Many commenters argue that traditional issue trackers are overwhelmed by user questions and non-actionable reports, making it difficult for contributors to find real work. They see the Discussion-first model as an effective filter that separates support from development. Proponents believe this separation of concerns is culturally important, setting clearer expectations for users and creating a more focused environment for developers.

However, a significant counter-argument questions the actual efficiency gains. Skeptics point out that the initial triage work—reading and understanding a report—remains the same regardless of whether it's a discussion or an issue. They suggest that the same outcome could be achieved using tags or labels on issues (e.g., "needs-triage" vs. "ready-to-work"). A few also noted that the policy doesn't prevent discussions from becoming noisy and that the ultimate goal should be to centralize bug reports, which are currently scattered across platforms like X (Twitter) and Discord.

Other tangents included the practical impact of this policy on users (one user abandoned Ghostty due to a memory leak that wasn't being tracked as an issue) and suggestions for how GitHub could better support this workflow natively with features like issue types or better project boards.

## [Can Bundler be as fast as uv?](https://tenderlovemaking.com/2025/12/29/can-bundler-be-as-fast-as-uv/)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46458302

> **Article:** The article, by Ruby developer Aaron Patterson, investigates whether Bundler (Ruby's package manager) can achieve the significant speed improvements seen in `uv` (a new Python package manager). The author analyzes `uv`'s speed by referencing a previous HN article, "How uv got so fast," which highlights several key strategies. These include: ignoring potentially incorrect upper-bound Python version constraints to reduce backtracking; using a single package index to avoid redundant network calls; skipping Python's bytecode compilation during installation; and leveraging a global cache and a more efficient dependency resolution algorithm (PubGrub). The article concludes that while a "rewrite in Rust" is one path, there are substantial algorithmic and design improvements Bundler could adopt to get much faster in the short term.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on whether package manager speed is a critical issue and the specific trade-offs involved in achieving it.

A primary debate was whether this level of performance is necessary. Some veteran developers expressed that package manager speed has never been a significant concern for them, unlike compilers or linkers. However, others countered that in modern development workflows—such as frequent CI/CD runs, spinning up ephemeral cloud dev environments, and managing large corporate projects with hundreds of dependencies—slow package managers create a major and costly bottleneck.

The conversation then delved into the specific optimizations `uv` employs, with a particularly critical eye toward its correctness. One commenter argued that `uv`'s speed is partly achieved by "being wrong," citing its practice of ignoring upper-bound Python version constraints and its different handling of multiple package indexes. This sparked a rebuttal from others who defended these choices as pragmatic and secure. They argued that upper bounds are almost always defensive and rarely predictive, and that `uv`'s single-index approach prevents dependency confusion attacks, a known security vulnerability in `pip`.

Finally, the discussion touched on the Ruby ecosystem's specific challenges. Some commenters pointed out that the core issue isn't just speed but also developer experience, such as the "mess" of managing multiple Ruby versions. Others noted that `uv`'s success comes from being a new, well-designed tool that doesn't have to replicate `pip`'s legacy flaws, suggesting a similar path for Ruby might be more effective than just patching Bundler. The conversation also mentioned alternative dependency resolution strategies like Minimal Version Selection and the potential of Ruby's Fibers for optimizing I/O-bound tasks.

> **Article:** This article from The Public Domain Review announces the works entering the public domain on January 1, 2026. In the US, works published in 1929 will enter the public domain, including the novel *The Maltese Falcon* by Dashiell Hammett, the song "The Charleston," and films like *All Quiet on the Western Front* and *The Broadway Melody*. In "life + 70" jurisdictions (like the UK and EU), works by authors who died in 1955 are being released, such as C.S. Lewis (*The Chronicles of Narnia*), Arthur C. Clarke, and Agatha Christie (*Destination Unknown*). The article also highlights the entry of early Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop cartoons, though it notes these are only the earliest, specific versions of these characters. The piece serves as a celebration of cultural heritage becoming freely available for reuse and adaptation.

## [50% of U.S. vinyl buyers don't own a record player](https://lightcapai.medium.com/the-great-return-from-digital-abundance-to-analog-meaning-cfda9e428752)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 189 | **ID:** 46454944

> **Article:** The article, "The Great Return from Digital Abundance to Analog Meaning," argues that the resurgence of vinyl is not about a return to superior audio technology, but a reaction against the intangible nature of digital streaming. In an era of infinite digital access, physical media like vinyl records have transformed from a mere audio format into a "token of identity" and a tangible way to support artists. The author posits that vinyl offers a sense of ownership, permanence, and meaning that streaming services, with their "marginal value" payouts and ephemeral libraries, cannot provide. It is a deliberate choice for friction and substance in a world of frictionless digital consumption.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates and expands upon the article's premise, exploring the multifaceted reasons behind the vinyl revival. A central theme is the shift in purpose: vinyl is no longer just for listening but has become a physical artifact representing one's identity and connection to an artist. Many commenters, who identify as part of this trend, state they buy vinyl primarily to financially support musicians, often listening to the music digitally via services like Plex or Jellyfin. This act is framed as a more direct form of patronage in an era of negligible streaming payouts.

Beyond financial support, the discussion highlights the appeal of physical ownership and the "ritual" associated with vinyl. It serves as a collectible, a piece of wall art, or a "totem" that makes a relationship with an artist tangible. This is contrasted with the "digital clutter" of streaming libraries, where saved songs lose meaning. The concept of "friction" is also praised; the deliberate act of buying and playing a record fosters a deeper appreciation and better-curated personal library than the passive, endless scrolling of streaming platforms.

However, the trend is not without its critics. Some view it as a "cargo cult" or a form of performative archaism for social media, creating unnecessary physical "stuff" and potential e-waste. A notable counterpoint warns against the negative impact of buying tickets to shows one cannot attend, as it harms venue planning. A particularly memorable anecdote described a father's five-year plan to get his daughter to appreciate high-fidelity audio by first gifting her a "shittiest briefcase record player," illustrating how intentional friction can cultivate a deeper appreciation for quality.

## [Children and Helical Time](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2025/12/30/children-and-helical-time/)
**Score:** 164 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46452763

> **Article:** The article "Children and Helical Time" proposes that our perception of time is logarithmic, meaning it feels like it passes more slowly in youth and accelerates as we age. The author illustrates this with a graph showing a child's year as a large fraction of their life, making it feel longer, while an adult's year is a much smaller fraction. The author finds this concept "depressing" in middle age but finds solace in the idea of "vicarious firsts" – re-experiencing the wonder and novelty of the world through the eyes of his children, which he describes as a "helical" pattern of revisiting these experiences on a new turn of life's spiral. The article also references the role of novelty in riveting our attention and making time seem to slow down, a phenomenon that becomes rarer in adulthood.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deeply divided reaction to the article's logarithmic time theory. Many users found the concept completely alien to their own lives, arguing that their most vibrant and "longest" feeling memories are from adulthood – such as having children, getting married, or pursuing passions – rather than a childhood they may not even remember vividly. A significant counter-argument emerged that subjective time is not a function of age, but of novelty, change, and emotional intensity. Several commenters suggested that a "boring" or routine adult life, particularly a monotonous job, is what causes the feeling of time accelerating, not age itself. The author of the post clarified in a comment that the graph was a simple illustrative tool, not a scientific claim. There was also a recurring theme that personal agency and a conscious choice to avoid "autopilot" living are key to maintaining a vibrant perception of time at any age.
