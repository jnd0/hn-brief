# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-02

## [Linux is good now](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/linux/im-brave-enough-to-say-it-linux-is-good-now-and-if-you-want-to-feel-like-you-actually-own-your-pc-make-2026-the-year-of-linux-on-your-desktop/)
**Score:** 615 | **Comments:** 523 | **ID:** 46457770

> **Article:** The article "Linux is good now" from PC Gamer argues that 2026 could be the "Year of the Linux Desktop." The author contends that Linux has matured significantly, becoming a viable and even superior alternative to Windows for many users, especially gamers. The primary driver for this shift is not Linux's perfection, but Microsoft's own missteps with Windows 11, including intrusive AI features, aggressive telemetry, and the forced integration of Copilot. The piece highlights that gaming on Linux, thanks to Valve's Proton, is now surprisingly effective, and the OS offers users a sense of ownership and control that Windows no longer does.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, but with significant caveats. The consensus is that Linux has reached a tipping point, not necessarily because it has become flawless, but because Windows has become more frustrating for many users. This sentiment is captured in the comment that "2026 is very much not the year of the Windows desktop."

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **The "Good Enough" Threshold:** Many commenters, including those who have recently switched, attest that for common use cases like web browsing and gaming, the experience is smooth and "just works." The improvements in gaming, driven by Proton and acknowledged by the mainstream press, are seen as a major milestone.
*   **Persistent "Edge Cases":** Despite the progress, several users point out specific, often niche, problems that prevent a full switch. These include kernel-level anti-cheat in games, professional software incompatibilities (CAD, specific Dropbox features), and hardware support issues (VR headsets, sim wheels, Bluetooth devices).
*   **The Stability Debate:** A recurring argument is whether Linux desktops are inherently flaky or if user experience varies wildly by choice of distribution. One user described systems becoming slow and unpleasant over time, blaming heavy defaults and background services. Others countered that this wasn't their experience with more stable distros like Ubuntu or Debian, suggesting that specific choices or hardware quirks are often the culprit.
*   **The Familiarity Problem:** A key barrier to adoption is familiarity. One commenter noted that Windows and Linux are both "rough" in different ways, but users have already learned to navigate Windows's rough edges. Switching requires learning a new set of problems to solve.
*   **Recovery and Control:** The discussion touched on system stability, with some warning of unrecoverable black screens. However, others argued that Linux is often easier to recover from than Windows due to its transparency, and features like NixOS's rollbacks offer powerful safety nets that Windows lacks.

## [Bluetooth Headphone Jacking: A Key to Your Phone [video]](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-bluetooth-headphone-jacking-a-key-to-your-phone)
**Score:** 453 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46453204

> **Article:** This article, a presentation from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3), details a series of critical vulnerabilities in Bluetooth chipsets manufactured by Airoha, a dominant supplier for many popular headphone brands. The exploit chain allows an unauthenticated attacker in physical proximity to silently connect to a target's headphones (e.g., Sony WH-1000XM5, Marshall Major V, Jabra Elite 8 Active). The attacker can then dump the device's flash memory via the unauthenticated RACE protocol to extract the Bluetooth Link Key. This key is used to establish a "trusted relationship" with the paired phone. Once the key is stolen, the attacker can impersonate the headphones, connect to the user's phone, and gain a privileged position to potentially compromise the device. The researchers also demonstrate how to read and write the headset's firmware, opening the door for both malicious attacks and user-led patching or customization.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, focusing on the technical details, the implications for consumer technology, and the broader context of Bluetooth security.

Many commenters expressed concern and validated long-held suspicions about Bluetooth's inherent insecurity. One user provided a clear, step-by-step breakdown of the attack, emphasizing the severity of stealing the Bluetooth Link Key to impersonate a trusted device. This vulnerability was seen as a vindication for systems like OpenBSD, which has historically resisted implementing Bluetooth due to its complexity and security risks. The general sentiment was that the "race to the bottom" in consumer electronics has created major security gaps, even in premium hardware.

A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, a trend popularized by Apple. Users noted the irony that the push for wireless convenience has introduced major security vulnerabilities. While some defended the move, citing the convenience of Bluetooth and the availability of USB-C DACs, the prevailing mood was critical of the industry's decision to eliminate a simple, secure, and reliable analog option.

Finally, the conversation touched upon the real-world impact and disclosure process. It was noted that major vendors were slow to respond to the researchers, with Sony receiving particular criticism. The vulnerability was also linked to a recent public statement by Vice President Kamala Harris, who mentioned she avoids wireless headphones for security reasons, adding a layer of real-world relevance to the technical findings. The community also discussed the potential for this exploit to be used by state actors and the frustrating experience of poor user interface design in Bluetooth devices, such as the lack of signal strength indicators.

## [A website to destroy all websites](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/)
**Score:** 447 | **Comments:** 254 | **ID:** 46457784

> **Article:** The article "A website to destroy all websites" is a manifesto advocating for a return to a more personal, creative, and less commercialized web. The author argues that the modern internet is dominated by algorithmic feeds, corporate platforms, and "doom-scrolling," which stifles genuine creativity and connection. To counteract this, they propose building a "Personal Web" by creating small, individual websites. The article concludes with five practical steps: start small, reduce friction to publishing, don't worry about design, use the IndieWeb (a set of open standards for interoperability), and share what you've made. The goal is to reclaim the web as a medium for personal expression rather than passive consumption.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely supportive of the article's sentiment but critical of its practicality and novelty. A central point of debate was the article's reliance on JavaScript, with some users arguing it fails the core ethos of the old web, while others defended it as a valid design choice. The feasibility of the call to action was questioned, with commenters highlighting significant barriers to entry for non-technical users, such as the cost and complexity of domains and hosting, which were much simpler in the era of services like Geocities.

Many users expressed nostalgia for the "old web" of personal sites and forums, but a counter-argument emerged that the modern, centralized web is simply more accessible and offers a clearer path to monetization for creators. A recurring theme was the tension between the desire for a decentralized, bespoke web and the convenience of platforms like Substack, which handle design and distribution for everyone. Ultimately, while many agreed with the article's idealistic vision, the discussion concluded that significant friction remains for the average person to create and maintain a personal website.

## [Show HN: OpenWorkers – Self-hosted Cloudflare workers in Rust](https://openworkers.com/introducing-openworkers)
**Score:** 405 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46454693

> **Project:** OpenWorkers is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to Cloudflare Workers, implemented in Rust. It uses the `rusty_v8` library to provide a custom V8 runtime, aiming for API compatibility with Cloudflare Workers (e.g., `fetch` handlers, `Request`/`Response` objects) to make it easy for developers to migrate existing code. The project's goal is to reduce vendor lock-in and offer a cost-effective, self-hosted solution for running serverless functions. The author is actively developing the project, with a CLI and GitHub integration planned for the future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively to the project, with several key themes emerging. The most prominent discussion point was **security and sandboxing**. Commenters expressed concern about the difficulty of ensuring a sandbox is truly secure against code escapes. The consensus was that while the V8 runtime level is important, the primary security advantage of official services like Cloudflare is their dedicated security teams and rapid patching of V8 vulnerabilities, which a self-hosted project may lack.

Other major topics included:
*   **Technical Clarification:** Users confirmed that OpenWorkers is a custom runtime, not a wrapper around Cloudflare's official runtime, and discussed its current limitations (e.g., lack of Durable Objects, WebSockets).
*   **Use Cases:** The project was seen as highly valuable for reducing vendor lock-in and for local development and testing of applications intended for Cloudflare deployment.
*   **Roadmap & Features:** There was strong interest in future features like Kubernetes deployment guides, GitHub integration for auto-deploys, and support for Cloudflare Workflows.
*   **Alternatives:** Some users noted that Cloudflare has already open-sourced its own runtime (`workerd`) and compared OpenWorkers to other self-hosting platforms like Rivet.

## [iOS allows alternative browser engines in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines-jp/)
**Score:** 378 | **Comments:** 328 | **ID:** 46453950

> **Article:** Apple has updated its developer policies to allow alternative browser engines in Japan, specifically to comply with Japan's "Act on Promotion of Competition in the Smartphone and Software Market." This change mirrors a similar allowance previously made for the European Union (DMA). The policy requires that any alternative engine must be memory-safe, and it imposes strict security and privacy requirements, such as separate binaries for the engine and a ban on sharing user data between the app and the engine. The change is geographically restricted to Japan.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of Apple's implementation, viewing it as a reluctant, minimal compliance with the law rather than a genuine embrace of competition. The consensus is that Apple is deliberately making the requirements so onerous and geographically fragmented that third-party browsers (like Firefox or Chrome) will find it impractical to ship their full engines, especially for a single market like Japan.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Skepticism of Apple's Motives:** Users argue that Apple is "maliciously complying" by creating logistical nightmares and overly strict rules. They point out that despite similar laws in the EU, no major third-party browser engines have been released, suggesting the barriers are too high.
*   **The "Monoculture" Concern:** One user raised a counterpoint that forcing competition could simply entrench the dominant Blink engine (used by Chrome), creating a monoculture similar to the old Internet Explorer era. However, others countered that Apple's current approach is not the right solution.
*   **Technical and Policy Barriers:** Commenters dissected the requirements, noting the irony that Apple mandates memory safety while WebKit (Safari's engine) is written in C++, though Apple is moving toward safer C++ practices. The requirement for separate binaries and strict data isolation was highlighted as a major hurdle that violates the spirit of the law.
*   **Regional Frustration:** US-based users expressed frustration that Apple implements these changes only where legally forced, denying US users the benefits of competition and data privacy rights (like GDPR or deletion rights) available elsewhere.
*   **General Distrust:** The conversation devolved into broader criticisms of Apple and Google's "walled gardens," with some users advocating for de-googled Android or Linux phones, though others admitted they were locked in by ecosystem integration and UX.

## [I rebooted my social life](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/this-might-be-oversharing)
**Score:** 375 | **Comments:** 292 | **ID:** 46453114

> **Article:** The article "I rebooted my social life" by James O'Malley describes his personal journey to combat loneliness and find a sense of community after realizing his social life was insufficient. He argues that while online friends and distant close friends are valuable, they cannot replace a local, active community. O'Malley details his proactive approach: he identified his interests (specifically, finding a local pub quiz team and a board game group) and deliberately sought out these activities in person. He emphasizes that building community requires effort and stepping out of one's comfort zone, but is essential for well-being and provides a support network that online interactions cannot replicate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many commenters sharing their own struggles with loneliness and strategies for building community. A central theme is the modern challenge of finding meaningful connection, particularly for adults, remote workers, and those who have moved to new places.

Several practical solutions were proposed and debated:
*   **The "Third Place":** Many users highlighted the need for a "third space" outside of home and work. Suggestions for these spaces included co-working offices (even for remote workers to get social interaction), local game shops for tabletop RPGs, and community centers.
*   **Activity-Focused vs. Friend-Focused:** A key piece of advice was to focus on the activity first ("activity hunting") rather than "friend hunting." This approach lowers the pressure and allows friendships to form naturally over shared interests, whether through joining a rock climbing club, a book club, or volunteering.
*   **Leading by Example:** One commenter shared a powerful story of starting a local climbing club, which in turn inspired another parent to start a board game club, illustrating that taking the initiative can create a ripple effect.
*   **The Role of Online Communities:** While the article distinguished between online and local communities, some commenters defended the value of online groups. However, others countered that relying solely on online friends can lead to excessive screen time and doesn't replace the tangible benefits of in-person interaction.

The discussion also touched on the difficulties of the process. One user expressed frustration with superficial connections and the unnatural feeling of seeking out friends as an adult. Another commenter offered direct advice to overcome this, suggesting getting housemates or simply pushing through the initial awkwardness. A recurring concern was the quality of existing communities, with one user lamenting that their social circle had become an uninspiring echo chamber of "STEM nerds," prompting advice to deliberately seek out new and different hobbies to broaden their network.

## [Finland detains ship and its crew after critical undersea cable damaged](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/31/europe/finland-estonia-undersea-cable-ship-detained-intl)
**Score:** 367 | **Comments:** 333 | **ID:** 46456797

> **Article:** CNN reports that Finland has detained a vessel and its crew for allegedly damaging a critical undersea cable in the Gulf of Finland. This incident is part of a broader pattern of damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, with reports of multiple cable cuts occurring between 2023 and 2025. The article highlights the geopolitical sensitivity of the region, which is a key maritime route for Russia and home to vital telecommunications and energy links for Baltic nations. The detention signals a more aggressive response from authorities following previous incidents that failed to result in prosecutions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by skepticism regarding the ability of legal systems to deter these actions. Many commenters argue that the current international legal framework is inadequate, pointing to a previous case that was thrown out due to a lack of proof of intent or jurisdiction. This has led to calls for more forceful physical deterrents, such as seizing and auctioning offending ships, or even military action like blockades or mining the gulf. However, other users caution that such measures could escalate the situation into an act of war or severely damage the regional economy.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on attribution. While some users immediately blame Russia, others demand concrete evidence linking the state to the sabotage, noting the complexity of ship ownership and the difficulty of proving intent. A few also floated the possibility of China being involved. Finally, some commenters offered alternative perspectives, suggesting the damage could be due to poor cable design and placement in shallow waters, or analyzing the strategic importance of the Baltic Sea as a geopolitical choke point for Russia's naval and trade access.

## [ACM Is Now Open Access](https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2026/january/acm-open-access)
**Score:** 321 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46454763

> **Article:** The article announces that the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is transitioning to a fully open access model for its Digital Library. This means that all articles published by ACM will be freely accessible to readers worldwide. The move is positioned as a major step towards making scientific research more available. However, the article clarifies that while access is free for readers, authors or their institutions will be required to pay Article Processing Charges (APCs) to publish their work, with waivers available under specific criteria.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and critical of the announcement, focusing on the nuances of the new model. The primary point of contention is that "open access" does not mean "free to publish." Commenters quickly pointed out that authors will face charges of over $1000 per article, which many see as a significant barrier, especially for independent researchers or those from less-funded institutions.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Author-Pays Model:** The dominant theme is criticism of the APC model. Users question the justification for the high fees, arguing that peer review is done by volunteers and that the primary cost for ACM is simply hosting PDFs. There is concern that this shifts the financial burden from readers to authors, potentially stifling research output.
*   **Skepticism of ACM's Claims:** Many commenters challenged the ACM's assertion of being a unique, highly curated open-access provider. They note that many other publishers are adopting similar models and that the "highly curated" aspect is debatable. The discussion highlights that ACM is a non-profit, which distinguishes it from for-profit giants like Elsevier, but this doesn't fully quell concerns about the new fees.
*   **The Purpose of Gatekeeping:** A counterpoint was raised about the need for financial barriers to prevent an overwhelming flood of low-quality or nonsensical submissions to conferences and journals. One commenter shared a vivid anecdote about a persistent "crank" to illustrate that some cost is necessary to maintain the sanity of the volunteer review system.
*   **Alternative Models and Information Sources:** Users pointed to alternatives. One commenter highlighted OpenAlex as a completely free and open alternative for metadata and research discovery. Another suggested that an "arXiv-overlay" model, where a journal simply curates existing preprints, could be a more efficient future.
*   **Confusion over "Fully Open":** A detailed comment clarified that even reader access isn't completely free, as the "Basic Edition" for individuals lacks advanced search features, and corporate/government pricing structures remain complex. This reinforces the feeling that the announcement is more marketing than a fundamental shift to universal openness.

## [Python numbers every programmer should know](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/python-numbers-every-programmer-should-know/)
**Score:** 316 | **Comments:** 137 | **ID:** 46454470

> **Article:** The article "Python numbers every programmer should know" presents a reference chart of performance and memory metrics for Python's built-in data types and operations. It provides specific, tangible numbers for common tasks, such as the memory footprint of an empty tuple (48 bytes), the time to create a list of 1,000 integers (115 µs), or the speed of a membership test in a set versus a list (200x faster for sets with 1,000 items). The goal is to give Python developers a concrete, intuitive feel for the cost of their code, helping them reason about performance and memory usage without needing to benchmark everything from scratch.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a divided view on the utility of the article's specific numbers. The central debate is whether memorizing such micro-benchmarks is valuable knowledge or a form of premature optimization.

Many commenters argue that these numbers are largely irrelevant for most Python programmers. Their core points are:
*   **Python is inherently slow:** If performance is a critical concern, Python is often the wrong tool for the job, and developers should switch to a lower-level language like C or Rust.
*   **Focus on Big-O:** Understanding algorithmic complexity (time and space) is far more important than knowing the exact cost of a single operation. A good algorithm in Python will always beat a poor one, regardless of micro-optimizations.
*   **Profile, don't guess:** Instead of memorizing charts, developers should use profiling tools to identify real-world bottlenecks in their specific applications and then optimize the critical paths, often by pushing that code into a C/Rust extension (like NumPy or PyTorch).

Conversely, a minority of commenters defended the value of this knowledge. They argued that:
*   **Performance is a leaky abstraction:** Even if you don't need these numbers daily, understanding them implicitly informs better API design, library choices, and coding habits (e.g., why f-strings are preferred for concatenation).
*   **It builds intuition:** The numbers provide a quantitative justification for the "feel" of performance that experienced developers develop over time.

A final, practical point raised by several users is that these numbers are not universal; they are highly dependent on the specific hardware, OS, and Python version, and can be misleading if treated as absolute truths.

## [Meta made scam ads harder to find instead of removing them](https://sherwood.news/tech/rather-than-fully-cracking-down-on-scam-ads-meta-worked-to-make-them-harder/)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46453582

> **Article:** An article from Sherwood News, based on a Reuters investigation, reports that Meta has a "playbook" to fend off pressure to crack down on scam ads. Instead of proactively removing all fraudulent advertisements, Meta allegedly focused on making them harder for regulators and journalists to find. The strategy involved identifying the specific search terms used by ad library users in Japan (e.g., celebrity names) and then repeatedly running those searches to find and delete the fraudulent ads that appeared. This approach allows Meta to claim it is taking action while leaving a vast number of other scam ads that aren't targeted by these specific searches active on the platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Meta, with commenters viewing this as a deceptive, PR-driven tactic rather than a genuine effort to protect users. The central theme is that Meta is prioritizing the appearance of compliance over actual safety.

A key point of debate is the specific method Meta used. One commenter argues this isn't true "cloaking" (a black-hat SEO technique), but rather a targeted deletion based on what they expect regulators to search for. However, another commenter strongly refutes this, labeling the practice as "cloaking" and drawing a parallel to the Volkswagen "Dieselgate" scandal, arguing that Meta is deliberately showing a different, cleaner version of its platform to inspectors than what regular users experience.

Many users express broader frustration with the prevalence of scams across all major ad platforms, not just Meta. Several commenters share personal anecdotes about seeing blatant scams on YouTube and Google Search, suggesting the problem is systemic. One user theorizes that there may be internal corruption or that high-spending advertisers are given preferential treatment, allowing their scams to bypass the strict rules that affect smaller advertisers.

The discussion concludes with cynical remarks about the lack of consequences for Meta, with commenters suggesting the company continues these practices because "money" and a lack of effective regulation allow it to.

## [2025 Letter](https://danwang.co/2025-letter/)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 198 | **ID:** 46454413

> **Article:** Dan Wang's "2025 Letter" is a comprehensive annual review contrasting the United States and China. The central thesis is that China excels in "hard tech" and infrastructure—building physical things at scale—while the US dominates in "soft tech" and culture, particularly in software, AI, and creating a vibrant, innovative environment.

Wang argues that the US is defined by its chaotic, creative energy, exemplified by Silicon Valley's culture and the Bay Area's social life. However, this comes at the cost of an inability to execute large-scale infrastructure projects due to vetocracy and regulatory hurdles. Conversely, China is portrayed as a highly disciplined, engineering-focused state capable of immense feats of construction and industrial policy but lacking in cultural dynamism and individual freedom. The letter also touches on the geopolitical "Cold War" dynamic, suggesting China is preparing for decoupling while the US is more focused on the conflict than the necessary domestic preparation. A notable data point is the claim that the median age of a Y Combinator founder has dropped significantly, suggesting a youth-driven boom in US startup culture.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely positive, with many users praising the article as a balanced and insightful read, particularly recommending Dan Wang's book. The conversation coalesces around several key themes:

*   **US vs. China Competence:** A primary point of agreement is the article's framing of the two nations' strengths. Users highlighted the line, "Beijing has been preparing for Cold War without eagerness for waging it, while the US wants to wage a Cold War without preparing for it," as a sharp summary of the dynamic. The core contrast of China's ability to build infrastructure versus America's focus on software and culture was widely discussed.
*   **Critique of Silicon Valley's "Meritocracy":** A significant counterpoint emerged against the author's claim that Silicon Valley is the most meritocratic part of America. Several commenters argued that "merit" is often determined by networking, prior employment at prestigious companies ("credentialism"), and access to venture capital, rather than pure skill or hard work.
*   **Cultural Observations:** The article's descriptions of Silicon Valley's culture sparked debate. While some appreciated the portrayal of its earnest and conversational nature, others found it to be a "puff piece" or criticized the lack of broader cultural output ("drip") compared to cities like New York or Tokyo.
*   **Data Point Scrutiny:** The statistic about the falling median age of Y Combinator founders was questioned, with one user pointing to conflicting reports that the average founder age is actually increasing, suggesting the distribution might be skewed.

## [Sony PS5 ROM keys leaked – jailbreaking could be made easier with BootROM codes](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/playstation/playstation-5-rom-keys-leaked-jailbreaking-could-be-made-easier-with-bootrom-codes)
**Score:** 247 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46455053

> **Article:** An article from Tom's Hardware reports on the leak of PlayStation 5 ROM keys, specifically the decryption keys for the console's bootloader. These keys are burned into the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) and are fundamental to the console's secure boot process. The article clarifies that this leak does not immediately enable a full jailbreak or custom firmware. Instead, it provides a crucial tool for security researchers, allowing them to decrypt and analyze the official bootloader. This deeper understanding could help them identify new vulnerabilities in the boot chain, making future jailbreaks potentially easier. The piece also references Sony's past security challenges, such as the PS3's cryptographic flaw, for context.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on clarifying the technical implications of the leak and speculating on its origins. A central theme was correcting the media's "hype," with users agreeing that the keys are a powerful tool for research but not a master key for piracy. They explained that while the keys allow decryption of the bootloader, enabling further study, they don't automatically grant the ability to sign and flash custom firmware.

The conversation also explored how the keys could have been extracted. The consensus was that this likely involved a sophisticated hardware-level attack on the APU itself, such as fault injection to bypass security checks, rather than a simple breach of Sony's corporate servers. This led to a debate on whether the vulnerability is truly "unpatchable." Some users theorized that Sony could have implemented a system of multiple, unused keys burned into the silicon, allowing them to switch to a new key via a firmware update if one was leaked, though others questioned the practicality of this approach.

Finally, participants contextualized the leak within the broader history of console security. They drew parallels to PC security features like TPM and Secure Boot, but noted that the PS5's "root of trust" is much deeper in the hardware, akin to Intel's Management Engine. The discussion also touched upon the PS3's infamous jailbreak, correcting a misconception that removing its "Other OS" feature caused the hack, when in fact the hack's discovery prompted the feature's removal.

## [BYD Sells 4.6M Vehicles in 2025, Meets Revised Sales Goal](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-01/byd-sells-4-6-million-vehicles-in-2025-meets-revised-sales-goal)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 341 | **ID:** 46454977

> **Article:** This Bloomberg article reports that BYD, China's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, sold 4.6 million vehicles in 2025, successfully meeting its revised annual sales target. The achievement highlights BYD's continued rapid growth and dominance in the global EV market, even amidst intense domestic competition and increasing trade barriers erected by Western countries.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on BYD's sales figures is multifaceted, centering on the competitive prowess of Chinese automakers, the geopolitical and economic implications for the West, and skepticism about BYD's business practices.

A primary theme is the sheer competitive advantage of Chinese EVs. Many commenters, including some with personal experience, attest to the high quality and value proposition of cars from BYD and other Chinese brands like Xiaomi. They argue that outside of protected markets in the EU and US, Chinese manufacturers "utterly dominate," offering superior products for significantly lower prices. This success is often contrasted with the perceived stagnation and lack of compelling options from legacy Western automakers.

However, this economic success is deeply intertwined with national security concerns. One prominent viewpoint argues that ceding the automotive industry to China poses a strategic threat to Western military capabilities by hollowing out a critical industrial base. This leads to a debate on the role of protectionism and subsidies. While some see tariffs as a necessary, albeit temporary, measure to allow Western companies to adapt, others argue that this protectionism only fosters complacency, citing the US auto industry's struggles in the 1970s. Commenters also debate the extent of state support, with many acknowledging that BYD receives heavy subsidies while also pointing out that Western companies and Tesla also benefit from government support.

Finally, a significant portion of the discussion is dedicated to skepticism about BYD's reported success. Commenters raised concerns about potential "dumping" of unsold inventory and questioned the company's financial health, drawing parallels to China's real estate crisis and accusing BYD of using a debt-fueled "Evergrande business model." These points were countered by others who downplayed the financial risks and explained the stockpiling as a normal part of the automotive supply chain.

## [Can Bundler be as fast as uv?](https://tenderlovemaking.com/2025/12/29/can-bundler-be-as-fast-as-uv/)
**Score:** 205 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46458302

> **Article:** The article, "How Bundler got so slow," by Aaron Patterson, analyzes the performance issues in the Ruby package manager, Bundler. The author identifies several key bottlenecks: the process of resolving dependencies from scratch for every invocation, the lack of a global cache shared across different Bundler instances, and the overhead of repeatedly downloading and parsing package metadata (gemspecs). The post contrasts this with other ecosystems, noting that RubyGems.org now provides dependency information via an API, which could be leveraged to avoid downloading and parsing individual gem files. It also references the "How uv got so fast" post for comparison, highlighting how the Python community is tackling similar problems by redesigning their package manager to take advantage of changes in their registry. The article concludes by suggesting practical improvements like a global cache and better concurrency for I/O-bound tasks, rather than a premature rewrite in Rust.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News revolved around several key themes. A primary point of comparison was the Python package manager, `uv`. One commenter criticized `uv` for taking shortcuts, such as ignoring upper-bound Python version constraints, to achieve its speed. However, others defended this as a pragmatic choice, arguing that upper bounds are often defensive and that Python 4 is unlikely. The security implications of `uv`'s handling of multiple package indexes was also debated, with some seeing pip's behavior as a security hole.

The conversation also explored the technical details of package management. Commenters noted that modern package managers like `uv` can be faster because they leverage a central database of pre-parsed dependency information from the registry, avoiding the need to download and parse individual package files. In contrast, older tools like `pip` and Bundler must perform this work locally. The use of YAML for package metadata was discussed, with some suggesting more efficient formats like JSON or protobufs could improve parsing speed.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader ecosystem issues. Some commenters argued that Bundler's slowness is not the most critical problem facing Ruby, pointing to issues like documentation quality and the complexity of managing multiple Ruby versions. Others expressed a desire for a Bundler replacement to adopt modern dependency resolution strategies like Minimal Version Selection. The feasibility of performance improvements was debated, with some suggesting concurrency models like fibers or threads for I/O-bound tasks.

## [Happy Public Domain Day 2026](https://publicdomainreview.org/blog/2026/01/public-domain-day-2026/)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46460440

> **Article:** The article from The Public Domain Review celebrates Public Domain Day 2026, marking the day when works from 1929 entered the public domain in the United States. Due to US copyright law (life of the author plus 70 years, or 95 years for corporate works), this is the first year since 1998 that new works have been released. The article highlights notable works entering the public domain, including the original "Mickey Mouse" (specifically the *Steamboat Willie* version of the character), the novel *The Maltese Falcon*, the film *All Quiet on the Western Front*, and the character Betty Boop. It also notes that while these works are free for reuse, later iterations of these characters and films remain under copyright, meaning creators must stick to the specific 1929 versions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the complexities and frustrations of modern copyright law. A major thread involves the difficulty of determining the public domain status of recorded music. Users explain the distinction between the copyright of the musical composition (which may be public domain if the composer died in 1929 or earlier, like Charlie Parker) and the copyright of the specific sound recording (which is often owned by corporations and lasts much longer), making it legally risky to use old recordings.

There is significant debate regarding the length of copyright terms. While some users express happiness that classic works like *The Maltese Falcon* are finally available, others argue that copyright lasts indefinitely (effectively "life of the author + 75 years" or "95 years" for corporations), stifling culture. A proposed solution of "pay-to-extend" copyright terms (paying increasing fees for longer protection) was debated; while it might limit corporate control, others argued it would unfairly disadvantage independent artists whose works might only become popular decades after release.

Finally, users discussed the practical implications of a work entering the public domain. They noted that while the *rights* are free, one must still acquire a copy of the work to distribute it. Restorations or new translations of public domain works (like the film *Metropolis*) may contain new copyrighted elements, and physical copies (like Blu-rays) may have anti-cirumvention protections that are legally difficult to bypass, even if the underlying content is free to use.

## [Children and Helical Time](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2025/12/30/children-and-helical-time/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 46452763

> **Article:** The article "Children and Helical Time" proposes that our subjective experience of time is logarithmic, not linear. It argues that a single year feels vastly longer to a child (e.g., one year is 1/5th of a 5-year-old's life) than to an adult (e.g., 1/45th of a 45-year-old's life), causing childhood to feel expansive and vibrant. The author suggests this creates a "helical" model of life where we are constantly re-experiencing our youth through the novel "firsts" of our children. This vicarious experience, combined with the "urgency" of parenting, serves as a defense against the monotony and time-acceleration of adult routine.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a deep divide on the article's premise. Many commenters strongly identify with the logarithmic time theory, sharing personal anecdotes of how their childhood summers seemed to last forever while recent years have blurred together. For these individuals, the article resonates as a poignant, if depressing, truth about aging and the loss of novelty. They often link this feeling to the "autopilot" nature of adult life and routine work.

However, a significant and equally passionate group of users finds the article's premise completely alien. They argue that their most vibrant and meaningful memories are from adulthood—such as having children, getting married, or pursuing passions—and that a fulfilling adult life can be just as novel and "long" as a childhood. This camp posits that the feeling of time accelerating is not an inevitable consequence of age, but rather a result of a boring, unfulfilling life or job. The debate centers on whether time perception is a universal mathematical function of age or a variable dependent on lifestyle, curiosity, and emotional state. A key sub-theme is the role of autonomy and freedom from obligation (e.g., financial independence, not being an employee) in creating a life that feels rich and memorable, regardless of age.

## [50% of U.S. vinyl buyers don't own a record player](https://lightcapai.medium.com/the-great-return-from-digital-abundance-to-analog-meaning-cfda9e428752)
**Score:** 160 | **Comments:** 173 | **ID:** 46454944

> **Article:** The article, "The Great Return from Digital Abundance to Analog Meaning," analyzes the resurgence of physical media, specifically vinyl records, in an era of digital streaming. The author posits that this trend is not about a return to a superior audio format, but a rejection of the "marginal value" and intangibility of streaming services. Vinyl has evolved from a purely functional audio format into a "token of identity," a collectible art object, and a tangible way to financially support artists who receive negligible payouts from streaming platforms. The article frames this as a cultural shift where consumers are actively seeking meaning, ownership, and a deeper connection with artists, which digital abundance fails to provide.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates and expands upon the article's premise, focusing on the motivations behind buying vinyl without playing it. A central theme is that physical media has become a form of merchandise or art. Users compare buying records to purchasing posters, t-shirts, or other collectibles, describing them as "artifacts," "totems," or "relics" that represent a fan's relationship with an artist and can be displayed in the home.

Supporting artists financially is a major driver. Several commenters admit to buying expensive vinyl as a direct donation or substitute for concert tickets they can't attend, viewing it as a way to compensate for the near-zero payouts from streaming services. However, one user cautions against buying tickets to shows one cannot attend, as it can negatively impact venue planning and block real attendees.

A compelling counterpoint is offered on the utility of physical media itself. One user argues that the "friction" of physical ownership helps build a better, more intentional personal library compared to the endless, disorganized "liked" playlists on streaming services, which he says work against the goal of curating a meaningful collection.

The discussion also touches on the experiential and generational aspects. A user shared a story about his father intentionally buying his granddaughters a cheap record player to teach them to appreciate good audio quality, a "five-year play" that sparked an interest in high-fidelity sound. While some commenters expressed a strong preference for the convenience of digital and found physical media to be an annoying burden, the overall sentiment acknowledges that for many, vinyl's value lies in its tangibility, the ritual of playing it, and its function as a piece of art, rather than its audio fidelity.

## [Why users cannot create Issues directly](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3558)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46460319

> **Article:** The linked GitHub issue explains that the Ghostty project does not allow users to create issues directly. Instead, users must start a discussion. The maintainers then triage these discussions and only convert them into issues once they are well-understood, actionable, and ready for a contributor to work on. The stated goal is to ensure the issue tracker is a clean, high-signal list of work items, avoiding the noise of user errors, configuration issues, and unrefined feature requests that typically flood open-source trackers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community had a mixed but thoughtful reaction to Ghostty's policy. The core debate centered on whether this two-step process is an efficient workflow or simply shifting the same work.

Several users supported the approach, arguing that it acts as a necessary filter. They believe it prevents the issue tracker from being cluttered with "noise" (misunderstandings, user errors) and ensures that any issue listed is a well-vetted, actionable task. This saves contributors time by letting them focus on coding rather than triage. Others noted that this is a common strategy for scaling large projects and that GitHub Discussions are culturally better suited for initial user support conversations.

However, a significant counter-argument questioned the actual efficiency gains. Skeptics pointed out that the initial triage work—reading and understanding a user's report—is the same regardless of whether it starts as a "Discussion" or an "Issue." They argued that the process could be replicated simply by using tags (e.g., "needs-triage" vs. "ready-to-work-on") within the issue tracker itself, or by using GitHub's built-in "Projects" feature for managing work-in-progress. The discussion also highlighted a real-world consequence of this policy: a critical memory leak investigation was spread across multiple platforms (Discussions, X/Twitter, Discord) and had not yet been promoted to an "official" issue, which led one user to abandon the software.

## [Worlds largest electric ship launched by Tasmanian boatbuilder](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/02/hull-096-worlds-largest-electric-ship-battery-power-launched)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46452937

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports on the launch of the "China Zorrilla," the world's largest electric ship, built by the Tasmanian company Incat. The vessel is a 130-meter roll-on/roll-off ferry designed to carry 2,200 passengers and 450 vehicles across the River Plate between Buenos Aires and Colonia del Sacramento. It is powered by a massive 250-tonne battery with 40 megawatt-hours of capacity. The ship is designed for short, high-frequency crossings and represents a significant step in decarbonizing maritime transport.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the technical specifications, practicality, and cost of the new electric ferry. A key point of interest was the weight of the battery system, with users comparing the 250-tonne battery to the roughly 700 tonnes of engines, gearboxes, and fuel in a conventional vessel, concluding the electric version is significantly lighter overall.

Several practical aspects of the ship's design were highlighted, noting that it uses an aluminum hull for weight savings and a water-jet propulsion system instead of propellers, which is better suited for the shallow waters of the River Plate. The logistics of charging were also questioned, with one user calculating that a full charge could take up to 10 days under realistic conditions, which seems impractical for its intended frequent service. The feasibility of adding solar panels to the ship's roof was also debated, with the consensus being that the power generated would be a negligible amount compared to the ship's massive energy needs.

The conversation also touched upon the project's context. Users noted that the ship was originally commissioned with a dual-fuel (LNG/diesel) engine before being redesigned as fully electric. The cost of the vessel (around $200 million) was compared to other ferry projects, with many agreeing it was a reasonable price for a large, custom-built, zero-emission ship. Finally, commenters expressed excitement about the quiet and smooth passenger experience of such electric ferries, contrasting it with the fumes and vibration of traditional ships.
