# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-06

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 847 | **Comments:** 376 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article from Low Orbit Security presents an analysis of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomalies that occurred on March 7, 2019, preceding the massive power blackout in Venezuela. The author observes that on this date, internet traffic destined for Venezuela's state-owned ISP (CANTV) was temporarily and unusually re-routed through networks belonging to Telecom Italia Sparkle and GlobeNet. This rerouting happened approximately 24 hours before the power outage began. The author posits that this was not a coincidence but rather a deliberate network manipulation, possibly as a preparatory step for a coordinated cyber-physical attack. The piece suggests this could have been used to monitor, disrupt, or prepare the digital infrastructure for the subsequent blackout, which severely impacted the nation's communications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article primarily revolves around the geopolitical implications of the event and the nature of modern cyber warfare. Many commenters interpreted the BGP anomalies as evidence of a sophisticated state-sponsored operation, with some explicitly linking it to US military capabilities and speculating on the strategic goals, such as intercepting communications or creating chaos by disrupting services like WhatsApp.

A significant portion of the debate centered on the vulnerability of the internet's core infrastructure. Several users noted that BGP is inherently insecure, making it a potent tool for disruption or espionage. The conversation also branched out into a broader critique of US foreign policy, with users drawing parallels to threats against Greenland and past military actions like the use of graphite bombs to disable power grids in Iraq and Yugoslavia. This led to a discussion on the reliability of American technology, with users debating whether dependence on US tech stacks is a necessary evil or a critical vulnerability for other nations. While some argued that non-US powers like China or Russia offer no safer alternative, others pointed out that Venezuela, under sanctions, was likely not using American tech, complicating the narrative. The thread concluded with a general sense of unease about the capabilities of cyber-warfare and the potential for such events to drive nuclear proliferation as a deterrent.

## [enclose.horse](https://enclose.horse/)
**Score:** 729 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46509211

> **Article:** The article links to "enclose.horse," a daily puzzle game. The objective is to enclose a horse within a grid using a limited number of wall blocks, while also trying to trap "cherries" to increase the score. The game is single-player, with a new puzzle available each day, and players can compare their solutions against an "optimal" solution calculated by the game's engine.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to the game, frequently comparing its daily, shareable nature to Wordle. The discussion focused on three main areas: gameplay mechanics, the technical implementation, and the underlying algorithmic problem.

Players offered feedback on the user interface, noting that the 3D visual effect of the walls was sometimes annoying and that right-clicking on tiles could be finicky. There was some confusion about the rules, with one user expecting the horse to move in response to placed blocks, which led to a discussion about similar "pursuit" games and John Conway's Angel problem. Regarding replayability, users debated whether the single daily puzzle was a feature or a flaw, with most agreeing that the daily challenge format was appropriate.

Technically, the author (Scaevolus) revealed that the optimal solutions are computed using Answer Set Programming (ASP) with the Clingo engine. They provided a code snippet demonstrating how the problem is modeled as a set of logical constraints to maximize enclosed area within a wall budget. This led to a discussion on the computational complexity of the problem (likely NP-hard) and alternative approaches like constraint programming.

## [Google broke my heart](https://perishablepress.com/google-broke-my-heart/)
**Score:** 492 | **Comments:** 249 | **ID:** 46505518

> **Article:** The article, titled "Google broke my heart," details author Jeff Starr's frustrating and ultimately futile battle with Google over a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown request. Starr discovered a website that had copied the entirety of one of his books. He filed a DMCA notice with Google to have the infringing link removed from search results. However, Google repeatedly rejected his request, citing "insufficient information" without ever specifying what information was missing or what proof they required. Despite Starr's repeated attempts to provide more documentation, including his ID and copyright details, he was met with automated, unhelpful responses. The author expresses deep disappointment, feeling that the system is broken and that a large corporation is indifferent to the struggles of independent creators.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article delves into the systemic issues of content moderation, corporate responsibility, and the power dynamics between individuals and tech giants. A central theme is the frustration with Google's opaque and seemingly automated support system. Many commenters argue that the core problem is the lack of clear guidelines on what constitutes acceptable proof of ownership, leaving creators like Starr in a "runaround" loop.

Opinions are divided on the root cause. Some suggest this is a consequence of Google replacing human moderators with AI or low-skilled support, leading to a system that is rigid and unresponsive. Others, however, point to the broader context of rampant abuse of the DMCA system, which is often used as a "dislike button" to suppress competition or content. From this perspective, Google's heightened skepticism and stringent (though poorly communicated) verification process are a necessary, albeit flawed, response to prevent fraudulent takedowns.

The discussion also offers practical, if cynical, advice. The most common recommendation is to "hire a lawyer," as legal professionals know how to navigate corporate bureaucracy and get a response from teams that are otherwise inaccessible. Other suggestions, like using PGP signatures or registering copyright, were met with skepticism, as commenters doubted these would be effective against an impersonal corporate machine. Ultimately, the consensus is that creators should not view Google as a "friend" or "ally" but as a bureaucratic corporation that must be treated with formal, legalistic pressure to achieve results.

## [The Post-American Internet](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/)
**Score:** 463 | **Comments:** 330 | **ID:** 46509019

> **Article:** The article "The Post-American Internet," by Cory Doctorow, argues that the US is abdicating its role as the dominant, rule-setting power of the internet. This creates a power vacuum, leading to a fracturing of the global digital space into competing spheres of influence (e.g., US, EU, China). Doctorow frames this as an opportunity to escape "enshittification"—the process where platforms degrade service to extract profit—which he argues is a direct result of US tech monopolies. He suggests that other powers, particularly the EU, can create a more open and competitive digital ecosystem by using regulation to break up monopolies, enforce interoperability, and repeal US-centric laws like the DMCA's anti-circumvention clauses, which would empower users and developers to build alternatives.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise of a "post-American" internet but expresses significant skepticism about the viability and desirability of the alternatives, particularly those led by the EU.

A central debate revolves around the feasibility of technological independence. One side argues that breaking free from US tech is technically and economically difficult, pointing out that companies like Apple and Microsoft could "brick" EU infrastructure overnight, and that users are too lazy to adopt non-mainstream alternatives. The other side counters that this threat is overblown, citing the immense financial incentive for US companies to remain in the European market, and that legalizing jailbreaking would spur an ecosystem of user-friendly alternatives.

The EU's role is viewed with deep ambivalence. While many commenters support the EU's consumer protection goals, there is a strong undercurrent of distrust regarding its own agenda. A recurring theme is the EU's "surveillance state" tendencies (e.g., chat control), which are seen as a parallel, and perhaps worse, threat to freedom compared to US corporate "enshittification." This leads to a sense that while the US is a declining power, the EU's vision for the internet may simply trade one form of control for another.

Finally, the discussion touches on the geopolitical context. Some argue that the US's aggressive use of sanctions and trade pressure makes it rational for other nations to defy US-centric copyright and IP laws. However, others caution that the US has historically used its military and intelligence apparatus to enforce economic compliance, suggesting that true independence is a much larger political challenge than just building new technology.

## [Brave overhauled its Rust adblock engine with FlatBuffers, cutting memory 75%](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/36-adblock-memory-reduction/)
**Score:** 422 | **Comments:** 227 | **ID:** 46501894

> **Article:** Brave published an article detailing a major overhaul of its adblock engine, which is written in Rust. The primary change was replacing JSON-based filter list parsing with FlatBuffers, a serialization format. This optimization resulted in a significant 75% reduction in memory usage, saving approximately 45 MiB for the default adblock configuration. The article notes that this memory saving scales with the number of additional block lists a user enables. The engine also leverages open-source Rust crates from the Servo project for CSS parsing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion围绕 several key themes:

**Impact of the Memory Savings:**
There was a debate on whether saving 45 MiB is significant. Some commenters initially dismissed it, but others clarified that this is the baseline saving for default lists and scales with user configuration. The context of per-tab processes and site isolation was raised, with the counterpoint that copy-on-write memory deduplication likely mitigates the impact of multiple processes using the same library.

**Technical Implementation & Ecosystem:**
The use of Rust and its ecosystem was a central topic. Commenters praised the engine's open-source nature and its use of shared crates (like those from Servo). This sparked a debate on the Rust ecosystem's tendency towards static linking versus traditional dynamic library sharing, with concerns about memory inefficiency and supply-chain security (similar to npm).

**Browser Competition & Features:**
The discussion broadened into a comparison between Brave and Firefox. A user mentioned considering a switch to Brave for its native vertical tabs, which prompted others to highlight Firefox's powerful extensions (like Sidebery) and its own native vertical tab support.

**Brave's Business Model & Reputation:**
Several comments addressed common criticisms of Brave. Commenters clarified that Brave does not replace ads with its own by default; its opt-in ad-rewards system was contrasted with the non-consensual tracking of other browsers. The "affiliate link" controversy was also mentioned as a past issue that Brave has since discontinued. A question about Brave being a "cryptocurrency pump-and-dump" was met with a firm denial.

**Other Points:**
*   A user noted the iOS release notes did not mention the efficiency improvements, leading to a discussion on whether the iOS version is a true port or a wrapper around Safari's rendering engine.
*   A user expressed a desire for a "de-bloated" version of Brave for Linux distros, to which a developer responded that a "Brave-origin" version is being considered.
*   Mobile limitations were discussed, with the lack of extensions being a key barrier for some, though others noted Brave's built-in adblocking and dark mode are compelling alternatives.

## [AWS raises GPU prices 15% on a Saturday, hopes you weren't paying attention](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/aws_price_increase/)
**Score:** 394 | **Comments:** 261 | **ID:** 46511153

> **Article:** The Register reports that AWS has increased the price of its GPU-heavy "Capacity Blocks" by 15% without direct notification to customers. The article frames this as a company hoping to implement a price hike quietly over a weekend. AWS Capacity Blocks are a pricing model designed to guarantee access to scarce GPU resources for a set period, distinct from standard on-demand instances. The article also notes that this price hike occurred just seven months after AWS announced significant price *reductions* for other GPU instance types, highlighting a contrast in pricing strategies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the implications of the price hike, the state of the GPU market, and broader concerns about the future of personal computing.

Several users debated the cause of the price increase. The consensus leans toward supply and demand dynamics, specifically a shortage of high-end hardware driven by the AI boom. Some argued that rising prices suggest hardware is becoming *more* valuable, contradicting recent industry trends of extending GPU depreciation lifespans. Others noted that this specific price hike applies to "Capacity Blocks" (guaranteed supply) rather than standard on-demand instances, suggesting it is a targeted adjustment for high-demand, reserved resources rather than a general rate hike.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the "enshittification" of cloud services and the reliability of AWS. Users expressed skepticism about AWS's reputation for lowering prices, with one user pointing out that AWS had previously warned of a price update in January 2026 (though not the direction). There was also a side discussion about the rising costs of hardware (GPUs, RAM, storage) and the fear that the market is shifting toward a "thin client" future where consumers rent computing power via subscriptions rather than owning their own hardware.

Finally, users shared tools to track cloud pricing and debated whether owning a personal GPU is becoming more cost-effective than renting.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 309 | **Comments:** 546 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An Ars Technica article reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming its users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok, while announcing no new technical measures to prevent this. The article details how X's official "Safety" account responded to reports of Grok being used to create CSAM by stating that users who prompt the AI for illegal content will be suspended, just as if they had uploaded it themselves. Critics, including AI safety researchers, point out that the company has not implemented basic safeguards, such as system-level prompts, to instruct Grok not to generate such material. The piece also highlights the broader issue of Grok being used to create non-consensual sexual imagery of public figures and everyday users, with the company's stance seen as an attempt to shift legal and moral responsibility away from itself.

## [Sega co-founder David Rosen has died](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies)
**Score:** 242 | **Comments:** 35 | **ID:** 46502239

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports the death of David Rosen, co-founder of Sega. It outlines his life, starting as a GI in post-WWII Japan where he founded a photo booth business ("Rosen Enterprises") which eventually merged with other companies to form Service Games (SEGA). The article traces his role in transforming Sega from a jukebox and arcade machine importer into a major video game company, highlighting key milestones like the development of the SG-1000 and Master System before he eventually left the company he helped build.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is characterized by a mix of nostalgia, historical surprise, and meta-commentary on HN submission dynamics. 

Many commenters expressed surprise at the revelation that Sega was founded by an American GI rather than a Japanese company, noting the irony that a company with such a distinct Japanese identity was started by an American. This led to reflections on Sega's complex corporate history, specifically the often-strained relationship between Sega of Japan and its Western offices.

There is significant praise for Sega's legacy, particularly their "stellar" arcade output and hardware. Several users highlighted Sega's modern approach to intellectual property compared to competitors like Nintendo, specifically commending Sega for embracing fan projects (like *Sonic Mania*) and emulation, whereas Nintendo is criticized for taking down similar projects.

A sub-thread emerged regarding the book *Console Wars*, with one user recommending it for Sega history, while another countered that David Rosen himself had criticized the book for inaccuracies regarding internal conflicts. Finally, a few users veered off-topic to complain about the inconsistency of HN's submission algorithm, noting that the article had been submitted multiple times previously without success.

## [Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/)
**Score:** 235 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46505975

> **Article:** Donut Lab has announced an all-solid-state battery with a claimed energy density of 400 Wh/kg. The announcement is linked to the launch of new electric motorcycles from its parent company, Verge Motorcycles. The company claims the battery enables a motorcycle range of 370 miles and can be charged to 80% in 10 minutes (with one marketing document claiming a full charge in 5 minutes). The battery is said to be non-lithium and uses abundant materials, with manufacturing reportedly starting in Finland.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by significant skepticism, tempered by the potential of the technology. The prevailing sentiment is "huge if true," with many commenters immediately flagging the announcement as potential vaporware or a scam due to the lack of established history, patents, or independent testing.

Key points of skepticism include:
*   **Lack of Track Record:** Commenters note that Donut Lab is a relatively new entity and lacks partnerships with major established brands, which is a red flag for unproven technology.
*   **Inconsistent Claims:** Users pointed out conflicting charging time claims between the press release (5 minutes for a full charge) and a promotional video (10 minutes for 80%), questioning the technical feasibility.
*   **Vague Technology:** The company avoids specifying the battery's chemistry, leading to speculation that it might be a sodium-ion variant (which typically has lower energy density) or that they are relying on a silent partner.

However, several users provided evidence suggesting the project is legitimate:
*   **Tangible Product:** Verge Motorcycles, the parent company, has physical stores in California where the motorcycle can be viewed, and they are taking pre-orders. This moves it out of the purely "digital vaporware" category.
*   **Source of Tech:** Commenters identified that the battery technology likely comes from Nordic Nano, a Finnish company that Donut Lab has invested in. This provides a plausible origin for the innovation.
*   **Manufacturing Footprint:** Links were shared indicating a factory is operational in Finland, with production starting in late 2025.

Ultimately, the community is waiting for real-world validation, with some suggesting local users in Silicon Valley should physically verify the product at the Verge store.

## [I/O is no longer the bottleneck? (2022)](https://stoppels.ch/2022/11/27/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck.html)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46506994

> **Article:** The article "I/O is no longer the bottleneck?" (2022) argues that with the advent of high-speed NVMe SSDs (which can reach speeds of several GB/s), the traditional bottleneck of I/O has been superseded by memory bandwidth limitations for a single CPU core. The author demonstrates that on modern hardware, a single core's memory bandwidth (around 6 GB/s on x86) is often the limiting factor for data-intensive tasks like parsing, rather than the storage device itself. This implies that software optimizations should shift focus from minimizing I/O operations to maximizing memory access efficiency, such as using zero-copy data formats to bypass the CPU's memory bandwidth ceiling.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance and context. A central theme is that the concept of an "I/O bottleneck" has always been more complex than just sequential read speeds; it historically included factors like disk seek times and, as one commenter notes, the fundamental latency vs. throughput trade-offs in software design.

Several users expand on the memory bandwidth limit, clarifying that the ~6 GB/s figure applies to a single core, while total system bandwidth (all cores combined) can be much higher. This leads to a debate on the architectural reasons for this limit, with speculation centering on the bus between the core and the caches/memory controller. The discussion also highlights practical implications, such as the potential for zero-copy serialization formats (like the one mentioned by a commenter) to "break" this limit by reducing the amount of data that needs to be moved.

Other points of interest include:
*   **Cloud vs. Hardware Reality:** A counterpoint that in cloud environments, I/O is often artificially throttled by providers as a billing metric, keeping it relevant as a bottleneck.
*   **Software Sluggishness:** A user questions why modern software (like Windows or messaging apps) feels slower despite hardware advancements. The consensus points to poor software architecture, specifically waiting for I/O on the main GUI thread, rather than hardware limits.
*   **Future Architectures:** A speculative thought experiment was raised about a future where storage and memory are unified (e.g., via CXL or persistent memory), eliminating the distinction between `malloc()` and file I/O, though others noted that ensuring true persistence (`fsync`) will always require special handling.

## [C Is Best](https://sqlite.org/whyc.html)
**Score:** 218 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46511470

> **Article:** The article "Why Is SQLite Coded In C?" by D. Richard Hipp, the creator of SQLite, defends the choice of C for the project. Hipp acknowledges that C is often criticized as outdated and unsafe but argues it is the ideal choice for SQLite's specific goals: extreme portability, stability, and longevity. He refutes common arguments for switching to modern languages like C++ or Rust. For instance, he argues that C++'s complexity and lack of a stable ABI make it unsuitable, while Rust's immaturity, complex build process, and lack of a standard OOM (Out-of-Memory) handling mechanism are significant drawbacks for a foundational library. The document concludes with an open-minded but pragmatic stance, stating that while they are not dogmatically attached to C, no other language currently meets their stringent requirements for "boring," stable, and universally portable software.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely mirrors the pragmatic tone of the article, with a strong consensus that C was the right choice for SQLite given its specific goals of stability and portability. Many commenters emphasize that the choice of a language is a means to an end, and for SQLite, C's "boringness" and decades of refinement are its greatest assets.

Key themes in the debate include:
*   **C vs. Modern Languages:** The primary debate is between C's simplicity and the safety features of Rust. While many agree with SQLite's reasoning, some argue that Rust's memory safety could prevent future CVEs, though others counter that SQLite's excellent track record proves C can be used safely with sufficient discipline.
*   **C Syntax and Complexity:** A minor debate erupted over C's syntax. One commenter claimed it was "too rich," which was met with surprise, with others clarifying they likely meant C++.
*   **Alternative Candidates:** Zig was mentioned as a potential future language due to its C compatibility, but it was quickly dismissed as being too immature for a project like SQLite.
*   **Specific Criticisms:** A notable point of contention was Rust's handling of OOM errors, a criticism also voiced by Linus Torvalds. A Rust advocate clarified that this is a misconception, as Rust gives full control over memory allocation, similar to C, especially in `no_std` environments.
*   **Historical Context:** Commenters noted that the article has been updated over the years and that C's dominance was partly solidified by historical decisions, like the GNU project's mandate to use C for portability.

Overall, the discussion validates the article's points, acknowledging that while other languages have their strengths, SQLite's requirements make C the most logical and proven tool for the job.

## [Why didn't AI “join the workforce” in 2025?](https://calnewport.com/why-didnt-ai-join-the-workforce-in-2025/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 301 | **ID:** 46505735

> **Article:** Cal Newport argues that 2025 was not the year AI "joined the workforce" because the gap between AI hype and real-world capability remains vast. He critiques the optimistic predictions of AI agents, citing examples like ChatGPT Agent failing at simple, multi-step tasks (e.g., selecting a value from a drop-down menu) that a human could do easily. Newport contends that the current generation of AI is fundamentally ill-suited for general agency because it operates on text, while most human-computer interaction is graphical. He concludes that we should stop focusing on hypothetical future capabilities and instead assess AI based on its actual, present-day performance.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News presented a divided view on the article's thesis, with debate centering on how to measure AI's impact and what constitutes "work."

Several users supported Newport's skeptical stance, arguing that the hype is disconnected from reality. They pointed out that the most successful AI applications, like coding assistants (Codex, Claude Code), thrive because they operate in constrained text-based environments with clear, objective feedback loops (compilers, linters). This contrasts sharply with the "hellscape" of graphical user interfaces that AI struggles to navigate. Others echoed the article's call to focus on current capabilities rather than future predictions, using analogies to emphasize that real-world problems exist in the present, regardless of future roadmaps.

Conversely, other commenters felt Newport was looking in the wrong places and underestimating AI's existing impact. A key counter-argument was the massive, albeit less visible, adoption of AI for tasks like homework, evidenced by the collapse of companies like Chegg. This suggests AI is already disrupting established systems, even if not in a formal "workforce" context. Furthermore, some argued that AI is already being used to automate "bullshit jobs" from within organizations, with clever employees using it to dramatically increase their productivity. This quiet automation may not show up as immediate job losses, but it is fundamentally changing the nature of work and will eventually lead to significant headcount reductions.

A third thread focused on the economic and practical realities of AI adoption. One user noted that job losses are often tied to expectations and hype cycles rather than immediate productivity gains, leading to companies making premature cuts. Another highlighted a crucial distinction: while AI can perform tasks, it lacks accountability. You can't "fire" an AI when it makes a costly mistake, which remains a significant barrier to full automation in many business-critical roles.

## [65% of Hacker News Posts Have Negative Sentiment, and They Outperform](https://philippdubach.com/standalone/hn-sentiment/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46512881

> **Article:** The article analyzes the sentiment of Hacker News posts and comments using a machine learning classifier. The key finding is that posts with negative sentiment significantly outperform others, receiving 65% more comments and 35% more upvotes on average. The author, Philipp Dubach, also notes that 65% of all HN posts have a negative sentiment. He plans to publish a more detailed paper on these findings and has made his data collection code available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely agrees with the article's premise, treating the finding that negativity performs better as an expected and well-understood phenomenon. Many commenters offered explanations for this behavior, ranging from evolutionary psychology—where prioritizing negative information is a survival mechanism—to simple user behavior, where agreement is often expressed with a silent upvote rather than a comment.

Several users questioned the methodology, particularly the article's claim of an average post score of 35, which was considered unusually high. The author of the original article appeared in the comments to acknowledge this potential skew, explaining that his sampling method might favor higher-voted posts and promising to investigate it further.

The tone of the discussion was largely humorous and self-aware, with comments like "BREAKING: 'HN is negative' confirmed by numbers!!" and jokes about the most effective clickbait titles ("Richard Stallman is Dead"). A recurring theme was the distinction between "negative sentiment" as a black-box classification and "critical discourse," which many argued is essential for substantive conversation and a natural counter to overly positive "slop" or "trade press."

## [Strange.website](https://strange.website/)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46506596

> **Article:** The article links to "Strange.website," a personal, idiosyncratic website that uses abstract, surreal, and text-heavy design. The content is esoteric and presents a strong, opinionated vision of the internet, rejecting modern web conventions in favor of a more chaotic and personal aesthetic. It includes a "I'm Feeling Lucky" style button that links to other random, strange sites on the web.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is sharply divided. Many users celebrate the site as a refreshing return to the "old internet" of personal, hand-crafted, and creative websites, praising its artistry and individuality. The site's design is frequently compared to the experimental novel "House of Leaves" due to its unconventional layout and use of colored text, a connection the site's own colophon confirms.

However, a significant counter-argument emerges, with some commenters finding the site to be self-important, pretentious "gibberish." They challenge the nostalgic narrative, suggesting that the "weird old web" is a romanticized myth and that the site's style is more akin to an LLM prompted to be "edgy." This sparked a debate about the nature of web history and the validity of such artistic expression. A separate, but related, discussion branched off to debate whether the internet itself is still fantastic while the "web" (as a medium) has become worse. Overall, the comments reflect a community grappling with nostalgia, the definition of creativity online, and the value of idiosyncratic projects in a standardized digital world.

## [GBC Boot Animation 88×31 Web Button](https://zakhary.dev/blog/gbc-web-button)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 14 | **ID:** 46507963

> **Article:** The article details the author's process of creating a high-quality, animated 88x31 pixel web button that mimics the Game Boy Color (GBC) boot animation. The author explains the technical challenges of capturing the animation accurately, which involved using an emulator's debugger to step through the game's code and extract the raw tile data and color palettes. They then recreated the animation pixel-by-pixel in a graphics program, ensuring it was faithful to the original. The final result is a crisp, looping GIF that captures the nostalgic feel of the classic handheld's startup sequence, presented as a modern homage to the vintage web button aesthetic.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters expressing nostalgia for the "web button" (88x31 pixel graphic) era of the internet. Many reminisce about using these buttons in the 1990s to show support for causes or to proudly display the tools they used to build their sites (like Notepad). The technical execution of the author's project is praised, and several users share personal stories about their own Game Boy Color hardware. The conversation also branches into related topics, such as the "userbar" trend in forum signatures and the existence of large online archives dedicated to preserving these vintage web artifacts. While there is a brief, minor exchange about self-promotion, the overall tone is one of appreciation for the detailed, niche project.

## [How Y Combinator made it smart to trust founders](https://elbowgreasegames.substack.com/p/when-good-actors-can-trust-each-other)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 113 | **ID:** 46501677

> **Article:** The article argues that Y Combinator (YC) revolutionized venture capital by creating a high-trust ecosystem that benefits founders. It contrasts the traditional VC model, which was often adversarial and mistrustful, with YC's approach of betting on the founder's character and competence rather than a polished business plan. This model fosters long-term relationships and aligns incentives, making it "smart to trust" capable founders. The piece also touches on the evolution of this model and its potential future, particularly in the context of AI and changing market dynamics.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion provides a multifaceted analysis of the article's claims, largely supporting the core idea while exploring its nuances, limitations, and evolution.

Key themes include:

*   **Applicability to Other Industries:** A central thread is whether YC's trust-based model can be replicated in other sectors, specifically the video game industry. While some are optimistic that small, clever teams can leverage new tech like AI to thrive, others are skeptical, pointing out that gaming is a hit-driven, capital-intensive B2C industry, fundamentally different from the B2B software world where YC's model excels.

*   **The "Golden Age" and Its Decline:** Many commenters reflect on the original YC ethos ("by hackers, for hackers") as a response to the "disingenuous and exploitative finance bro types" of the dot-com era. There is a recurring sentiment that YC has changed, with some suggesting it's now more about selling companies to an "old boys' network" and is filled with "nepo founders" and fraud. The question of whether the high-trust model can survive YC's recent pivot to prioritizing AI startups is also raised.

*   **The Founder Selection Process:** The discussion delves into *how* YC achieves its high-trust environment. It's described as a three-tiered filter: 1) Founder background (e.g., good engineers, Ivy League, ex-founders), 2) The idea itself, and 3) A very brief interview. This suggests YC primarily selects for a certain type of competent person upfront, rather than trying to build trust from scratch with anyone.

*   **The "Dark Side" of the Model - Employee Equity:** A significant counter-narrative emerges, arguing that while YC's model may protect founders from VCs, it has created a new problem: early employees are often "screwed" with sub-market salaries and minuscule ISO grants instead of real equity. This challenges the idea that the ecosystem is beneficial for *all* participants.

*   **Analogies and Broader Principles:** The model is compared to the military doctrine of *Auftragstaktik* (mission tactics), which emphasizes entrusting competent subordinates with wide latitude to achieve a goal. This reinforces the idea that YC's success is rooted in a deep-seated belief in founder autonomy and competence.

## [Pentagon moves to punish Democratic senator over 'seditious video'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8039wg1rdo)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46504159

> **Article:** An article from the BBC reports that the Pentagon, under the authority of Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly, is moving to punish retired Rear Admiral and current Democratic Senator from Illinois, Mark Kelly. The potential punishment includes the revocation of Kelly's military pension. The action is a response to a video Kelly released in which he encouraged service members to disobey "illegal orders," specifically referencing the potential deployment of military personnel to U.S. cities to quell civil unrest. The Pentagon alleges this constitutes "seditious" activity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, focusing on the political, legal, and procedural implications of the Pentagon's actions. A primary theme is the legal basis for the punishment. Several commenters argue that Kelly's statements were not seditious but were a restatement of established military doctrine regarding the duty to disobey illegal orders. They question the legality of punishing a retired officer for statements made after his service and predict the move will not survive legal scrutiny.

The political motivations behind the action are heavily scrutinized. Commenters suggest the Pentagon's move is a politically motivated attempt to intimidate dissidents and curry favor with the MAGA base, with one user noting that the extreme nature of the act benefits the perpetrator's political standing. There is also speculation that this could backfire by elevating Kelly's political profile.

Finally, a significant portion of the discussion is meta-commentary about Hacker News itself. Several users complain that the article was "flagged" and temporarily removed from the front page, viewing it as a form of censorship and a brand risk for the platform. This sparks a debate about moderation, with some defending the system and others wishing for an "unflag" option to counteract what they perceive as politically motivated suppression.

## [Gatekeepers of Law: Inside the Westlaw and LexisNexis Duopoly](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/gatekeepers-of-law-inside-the-westlaw)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46502736

> **Article:** The article, "Gatekeepers of Law," argues that Westlaw and LexisNexis form a duopoly that privatizes and paywalls American law. It contends that while the law itself is in the public domain, these companies have built a lucrative business by selling access to and annotation of legal codes and court documents. The piece highlights the high cost of accessing court records through systems like PACER and the difficulty of obtaining public legal data, which creates a significant barrier for journalists, researchers, and the general public. This effectively makes the legal system opaque and inaccessible to anyone who cannot afford expensive subscriptions, turning a fundamental pillar of democracy into a commercial enterprise.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expanding on the theme of legal information inaccessibility with specific, often personal, examples. A central point is that the problem extends beyond the duopoly to the government itself; one commenter notes that even official state websites can have outdated laws, and another provides a detailed account of the bureaucratic nightmare of obtaining court documents, transcripts, and data in Illinois, describing it as intentionally obfuscated.

Several users highlight the critical role of non-profit efforts to counter this trend, with the Free Law Project and its CourtListener service being praised as the "best org" for providing free access to legal documents. Other projects like PlainSite, Reclaim The Records, and MuckRock were also mentioned as valuable resources. The discussion also touched on the legal boundaries of this issue, referencing the Supreme Court case where Georgia failed to copyright its state laws, though one commenter clarified the ruling's nuance pertained to "official" annotations.

A key debate emerged around the feasibility of solving the problem. While some expressed deep pessimism, stating that fixing the legal data system is a prerequisite for any meaningful policy change, others countered that such discouragement is unproductive and pointed to successful free legal databases in other countries like Australia's AustLII. The conversation also delved into the economic mechanics, with one user arguing that PACER's per-page fees incentivize data hoarding by large firms over efficient querying by newcomers, thereby reinforcing the duopoly.
