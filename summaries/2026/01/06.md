## [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Score:** 2247 | **Comments:** 877 | **ID:** 46497712

> **Article:** The article "It's hard to justify Tahoe icons" by Anton Troynikov critiques the user interface (UI) design choices in Apple's macOS Tahoe. The author argues that the new design introduces unnecessary visual clutter and inconsistency, specifically targeting the use of icons in context menus. He points out that many of the new icons are ambiguous, visually noisy, and misaligned, failing to provide the quick visual cues they are intended for. Troynikov contrasts this with older, more functional UI paradigms (like Office 2000 or Windows 2000) and suggests that modern design often prioritizes aesthetic trends over usability and clarity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by a central irony pointed out by numerous users: the article, which criticizes distracting UI elements, is hosted on a website that features an animated snow effect and a custom cursor, which many commenters found equally or more distracting. This sparked a debate about the context of design, with some defending the animations as acceptable for a personal blog, while others argued that it undermines the author's message.

Beyond the site's design, commenters largely agreed with the article's core thesis. There was a strong sentiment that UI/UX quality has declined over the past two decades, with many citing Windows 2000, Windows 7, and older versions of Mac OS as "peak usability." The discussion branched into broader critiques of modern software design, suggesting that companies prioritize frequent, superficial changes for business metrics (like KPIs or to justify jobs) rather than focusing on stability and user productivity. Some commenters pointed to Linux desktop environments like KDE as a modern example of getting these UI details right.

## [Anna's Archive loses .org domain after surprise suspension](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/)
**Score:** 620 | **Comments:** 314 | **ID:** 46497164

> **Article:** The article from TorrentFreak reports that Anna's Archive, a major search engine for pirated books and academic papers, has lost its `annas-archive.org` domain. The domain was suspended by the Public Interest Registry (PIR) due to a "ServerHold" status, effectively taking the site offline via that address. The suspension is believed to be the result of legal pressure from major music labels and other rights holders. The article notes that the team behind the site had previously anticipated such actions and advises users to check their Wikipedia page for updated domain information to circumvent the block. The site remains accessible through its `.se` domain and other mirrors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the predictable nature of the domain seizure, methods for circumventing censorship, and the broader implications for digital preservation.

There is a consensus that the suspension was an expected consequence of challenging powerful copyright industries. Users expressed support for Anna's Archive's mission, framing it as a vital effort for digital preservation, akin to "seed vaults" for culture, and argued that such crackdowns often backfire by generating publicity and driving more traffic to the service.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on censorship-resistant technologies and workarounds. Several users provided alternative links, such as `annas-archive.se` and `open-slum.org`. The use of Wikipedia as a de facto DNS to share the latest domain was debated; some saw it as a clever tactic, while others worried it could expose Wikipedia to legal liability. Other technical solutions discussed included using decentralized networks like Yggdrasil and Nostr, seeding torrents to make the content resilient to takedowns, and the potential of Tor's `.onion` services. The technical details of the `serverHold` status were also examined, with users confirming it's a common tool used by registries in response to legal pressure.

## [Databases in 2025: A Year in Review](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html)
**Score:** 559 | **Comments:** 151 | **ID:** 46496103

> **Article:** The article, "Databases in 2025: A Year in Review," is a retrospective written by Andy Pavlo of CMU. It covers the major trends and events in the database landscape for the year 2025. The post highlights key developments such as the rise of AI-native databases, the increasing importance of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and significant industry movements like acquisitions and funding rounds. Pavlo also touches on the evolution of established players and the emergence of new technologies, providing a high-level overview of the forces shaping the industry during that year.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on a few key themes, with the most prominent being the security implications of new AI-integration protocols. Commenters expressed significant concern about the Model Context Protocol (MCP), arguing that its design philosophy of maximizing context availability directly contradicts the security principle of least privilege. One user likened the potential risks to a new form of SQL injection, where the "injection" could come from an LLM's own hallucinations rather than a malicious user. This sparked a sub-thread where developers discussed potential mitigation strategies, such as implementing a gateway to monitor context based on frameworks like the "lethal trifecta."

Another major point of discussion was the fate of the database "Gel" (formerly EdgeDB), which was recently acquired by Vercel. This news prompted a debate about whether the acquisition signaled the end of the project, with some users expressing dismay. The original author, Pavlo, acknowledged this concern and updated his article to reflect the acquisition.

Finally, the discussion included several recurring topics. A notable thread praised the unique and "gangsta" teaching style of the CMU database group, with users sharing links to their popular lecture videos. There was also a debate on broader industry trends, with some users noting a continued move towards SQLite and JSON, while others countered that "everything is DuckDB." Several commenters also pointed out omissions in the article, questioning the lack of coverage on time-series databases, immutable/bi-temporal databases, and established systems like SQLite and Oracle, though the author responded to some of these comments with links to sections of the article they had missed.

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 539 | **Comments:** 296 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article from Low Orbit Security analyzes BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing data to argue that the Venezuelan blackout on March 7, 2019, was a deliberate, sophisticated cyber-attack rather than a simple infrastructure failure. The author points to specific BGP anomalies occurring approximately 24 hours before the power outage. During this window, internet traffic destined for Venezuela was rerouted through unusual paths, specifically via networks like Sparkle (Telecom Italia) and GlobeNet. The article suggests this rerouting could have been used to monitor, intercept, or disrupt communications in preparation for the physical grid takedown, characterizing the event as a state-sponsored "snatch operation" targeting the nation's infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion interprets the article's findings as evidence of a sophisticated US cyber-warfare operation, sparking debate on the nature of modern conflict and infrastructure security. A central theme is the vulnerability of the internet's core protocols, with users noting that BGP's inherent lack of security allows such traffic hijacking to occur. Commenters debated the strategic intent of the BGP rerouting, speculating it was used for either espionage (spying on traffic) or tactical disruption (denying communication channels like WhatsApp during a critical moment).

The conversation quickly broadened to the geopolitical implications of such capabilities. Many drew parallels to current events, expressing alarm over US threats against Greenland and Canada, suggesting that Venezuela serves as a precedent for using cyber and economic pressure against sovereign nations. This led to a discussion on the necessity of nuclear deterrence and the "catch-22" of technological dependence: while reliance on US technology exposes nations to this kind of interference, developing independent tech is prohibitively expensive, and switching to other powers like China simply trades one risk for another. Ultimately, the community viewed the event as a terrifying demonstration of how cyber-warfare can disable critical infrastructure without conventional military force.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 439 | **Comments:** 262 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica details a legal battle stemming from a murder-suicide case involving a man named Ethan. The victim's family is suing OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT contributed to Ethan's deteriorating mental state and eventual death. The core of the dispute is OpenAI's refusal to release Ethan's chat logs to the family, citing user privacy policies. The family argues they need the logs as evidence to understand what role the AI played in the events leading up to the tragedy. The case highlights the growing tension between a company's duty to protect user data and the legal rights of a deceased user's estate to access that data for litigation purposes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, with commenters exploring several key themes. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the inherent risks of current AI models, specifically their tendency towards "sycophantic" behavior. Users pointed to other examples of AI models reinforcing users' delusions, suggesting this is a systemic issue rather than an isolated incident. This led to broader skepticism about the industry's goal of creating "superintelligence," with many arguing that if companies cannot make a simple chatbot safe, it is irresponsible to build more powerful systems.

Another major theme is the legal and ethical conflict at the heart of the case. Commenters debated the balance between posthumous privacy and the need for evidence in a wrongful death lawsuit. While some argued for the sanctity of user data even after death, others contended that justice for the victim's family should take precedence.

Finally, there was significant skepticism about the narrative that AI was the primary cause of the tragedy. Several commenters suggested that other factors, such as the victim's reported use of performance-enhancing drugs, were more likely to be the root cause of his mental health decline. This skepticism reflects a broader sentiment that the media may be sensationalizing AI's role in complex human tragedies.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 408 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The Hacker News post alleges that RevisionDojo, a Y Combinator (YC) startup, is engaging in "astroturfing" campaigns. This involves creating fake grassroots support to promote their product, specifically targeting children and students. The post implies that the company is using deceptive marketing practices to gain traction and credibility within the student community.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mixture of cynicism, outrage, and calls to action. The prevailing sentiment is that while the alleged behavior is unethical, it is unfortunately not surprising for a YC-backed startup, with several users pointing to a "growth at all costs" or "fake it till you make it" culture within YC. The discussion quickly broadened to include other startups accused of similar deceptive practices, such as Pickle (for misleading customers about its hardware) and Honey (for being a "scam"), reinforcing a narrative that YC is full of questionable companies.

Many users expressed that astroturfing and the use of "sockpuppet" accounts are rampant across social media, including Reddit and even Hacker News itself. Practical advice was shared on how to report the alleged fraud to authorities like the FTC and state Attorneys General. The conversation also touched upon the ethics of the test-prep industry, with some commenters suggesting that RevisionDojo's market is inherently focused on facilitating cheating, which is a significant driver of demand. Overall, the discussion was highly critical of both the specific company and the broader startup culture it represents.

## [Google broke my heart](https://perishablepress.com/google-broke-my-heart/)
**Score:** 324 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46505518

> **Article:** The article "Google broke my heart" by Jeff Starr details his frustrating experience with Google's handling of a DMCA takedown request. Starr, an author and web developer, found that a link to one of his books was removed from Google Search results following a DMCA complaint. He alleges that Google's process is broken, as their support was unhelpful and unable to provide a clear path for him to prove his ownership of the content. He describes the experience as emotionally draining and a failure of a system that should protect creators, instead leaving them powerless against what he believes was a fraudulent claim.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the systemic failures of Google's DMCA process and the appropriate response for affected creators. A primary theme was the debate over whether Google's increased verification is a necessary evil or a broken system. Some commenters argued that stricter verification is a direct response to the surge in fraudulent DMCA claims used as a "dislike button," while others countered that Google's process is opaque, offering no clear guidance on what proof of ownership is acceptable.

Many users expressed deep cynicism about dealing with large corporations, advising the author that legal action is the only effective path. This sentiment was supported by references to other high-profile cases, like LegalEagle's YouTube struggles, showing the problem is not unique. Practical advice was offered, such as registering copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office to create a clear legal record, though some doubted this would change the outcome with Google's support.

Finally, commenters offered alternative theories for the issue, including a potential name confusion with the controversial figure Jeffree Star, and broader critiques of how for-profit entities operate. The overall consensus was that the author was facing a bureaucratic machine, not a personal betrayal, and that the system is fundamentally flawed for individual creators.

## [Microsoft Office renamed to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app”](https://www.office.com)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 237 | **ID:** 46496465

> **Article:** The article reports that Microsoft has renamed its "Microsoft Office" mobile and web application to the "Microsoft 365 Copilot app." The title of the article is "Welcome to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app," and it explicitly refers to the application as "The Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)." This change appears to affect the unified app experience on platforms like Android and iOS, as well as the web portal at office.com, which now redirects users to the Copilot-centric interface.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to this news with widespread ridicule and confusion, characterizing the rebrand as "bizarre," "desperate," and "the worst rebrand ever." The consensus is that the "Office" brand is significantly more valuable and recognizable than "Copilot," and the new name fails to clearly communicate that the app is a productivity suite for creating documents and spreadsheets.

Commenters offered several cynical interpretations of Microsoft's strategy:
*   **AI Hype Cycle:** The rename is seen as a desperate attempt to align a legacy product with the "AI" buzzword to appear innovative to investors, rather than serving user clarity.
*   **Inflating Metrics:** Several users speculated that the primary motivation is to artificially boost Copilot adoption statistics by forcing all Office app users into the "Copilot" branded ecosystem.
*   **Brand Dilution:** Users noted that the branding is increasingly incoherent, with "Microsoft," "365," "Copilot," and "Office" all being mixed in a way that makes the product offering difficult to understand.

There was also some debate regarding the scope of the change, with one user pointing out that it might only apply to the mobile app and web portal, while the desktop suite and one-time purchases retain the "Office" name. However, others countered that the web experience is already heavily skewed toward Copilot, making the distinction moot for many users.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 301 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that the proliferation of AI-generated video is a net negative for society. The author contends that these videos are not a form of creative expression but rather a "harmful" medium for several reasons. Firstly, they are built on a foundation of uncredited, stolen intellectual property. Secondly, they are flooding the internet with a deluge of low-quality, often deceptive content, making it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction and eroding trust. The author also points to the environmental and infrastructural costs, such as the massive computational resources required. Finally, the piece argues that AI video generation removes the actual craft and creativity from the creative process, reducing the user to a mere prompter and producing a homogenous, "uncanny valley" aesthetic that is visually repellent.

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – Log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 292 | **Comments:** 127 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project, "DoNotNotify," is an Android application designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log notifications and create intelligent, rule-based filters to block unwanted ones. The primary goal is to combat "notification spam," where functional apps (like rideshare, delivery, or community management apps) mix marketing and promotional alerts with essential, time-sensitive information, making it difficult for users to manage them through standard OS settings.

The developer, awaaz, highlights its utility for apps that force users to enable notifications for core functionality but then abuse that access with ads. The app aims to provide a solution for users who need to keep an app but want to silence its non-essential noise.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a widespread user frustration with notification spam, particularly from major apps like Uber, Facebook, and delivery services that mix essential alerts with marketing. Users see this as a "dark pattern" and a failure of app stores to enforce their own guidelines.

Several users shared their own solutions and existing alternatives. A popular recommendation is **BuzzKill**, an established Android app with similar rule-based filtering capabilities, prompting questions about what DoNotNotify does differently. Other strategies mentioned include putting problematic apps in a separate "Work Profile," putting the phone on permanent silent, or simply uninstalling offending apps altogether.

There's a strong consensus that the core problem lies with developers who ignore or misuse Android's notification categories. While Android offers more granular control than iOS, users still find it cumbersome to manage, especially with apps that create dozens of notification channels to overwhelm the user. The conversation also touched on the limitations of OS-level blocking, noting that some persistent notifications from system services (like VPNs) cannot be dismissed by third-party apps.

## [California residents can now request all data brokers delete personal info](https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/)
**Score:** 291 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46495220

> **Article:** The article announces that California residents can now use a new state-run portal, consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov, to request that all registered data brokers delete their personal information. This initiative is part of the California Delete Act, which builds upon the existing California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The law requires data brokers to register with the state and to process these deletion requests at least once every 45 days, starting in 2026. The goal is to provide a centralized, one-stop method for residents to remove their data from the data broker ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and focused on the practical limitations and enforcement of the new law. A central theme is the law's potential ineffectiveness. Commenters question how the system will prevent data from being immediately re-collected from other sources, noting that data brokers could simply re-acquire the information from non-California entities or from brokers who are not compliant. There is a recurring concern that the 45-day processing window creates a significant loophole, allowing brokers to hold and use personal data for nearly the entire period before a deletion request is fulfilled.

The conversation also touched on the broader political context, with some users expressing pessimism about the chances of a similar federal law being passed due to corporate lobbying. Other practical issues raised included technical difficulties with the state's web form (e.g., cumbersome date-of-year selection) and the fact that the law only applies to current residents, excluding former residents who may have significant data held by brokers. While some users defended the law's value, particularly for individuals who may be targeted by harassment or doxxing, the prevailing sentiment was one of skepticism about its real-world impact and enforceability.

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 268 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article is a personal testimonial from a developer who switched from VS Code to the Zed editor. The author details their motivation, which stemmed from a growing dissatisfaction with VS Code's performance, such as slow startup times and laggy response, and a desire for a more modern, faster, and natively performant editing experience. They highlight Zed's key strengths, including its incredible speed, clean and intuitive user interface, excellent out-of-the-box experience for languages like Rust and TypeScript, and well-implemented collaboration features. The piece concludes that for the author's workflow, Zed successfully delivers on its promise of being a "modern code editor" and has become their daily driver.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion provides a multifaceted look at the real-world experience of adopting Zed, with a strong consensus on its speed and modern feel but significant debate over its maturity and ecosystem. A central theme is the tension between Zed's appeal to individual developers and its viability for large organizations. While some argue that being tied to a specific IDE is a problem, others point out that the established VS Code ecosystem, especially in specialized fields like embedded systems where chip manufacturers provide VS Code-based toolchains, makes a switch practically impossible for many professionals.

The conversation also surfaces several specific pain points and blockers for potential users. A recurring complaint is poor font rendering on low-DPI monitors, which many commenters cite as a deal-breaker. Other missing or underdeveloped features include robust Emacs keybindings, vertical tab support, and LSP semantic highlighting for custom languages. On the other hand, Zed's AI integration is praised for being surprisingly stable and useful, though some users express concern that the team might be prioritizing these "non-core" features over fixing fundamental editor parity issues. The discussion also highlights workarounds for missing functionality, such as using external tools like `lazygit` for Git operations, and reveals a split opinion on the editor's hardware requirements, with some users on older machines being wary of the GPU dependency.

## [A spider web unlike any seen before](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/science/biggest-spiderweb-sulfur-cave.html)
**Score:** 277 | **Comments:** 135 | **ID:** 46496054

> **Article:** Researchers have discovered the largest spider web ever recorded inside a remote cave in the Amazonian region of Brazil. The colossal structure is a communal web built by thousands of social spiders of the species *Sphingius thesceliodes*. The cave is filled with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas, an environment lethal to most animals, which likely protects the spiders from predators. The web spans the entire cave and is sustained by a massive population of over 111,000 spiders, which feed on a thriving ecosystem of more than 2.4 million midges that also inhabit the cave.
>
> **Discussion:** The discovery sparked a mix of fascination, revulsion, and scientific curiosity among Hacker News commenters. The most immediate reaction was one of awe and horror, with users joking about "noping out" and expressing relief that such a spectacle is confined to a remote cave. A central point of discussion was the ecological puzzle of how such a large population could survive. This was quickly answered by a commenter who quoted the article, explaining that the cave's unique, toxic atmosphere supports a massive food source of midges, which in turn sustain the spiders.

Conversation then shifted to the spiders' behavior. One user questioned the assumption that spiders are solitary, prompting others to point out the existence of hundreds of social spider species and even recommend a relevant science fiction novel. The practical implications of the discovery also arose, with one commenter humorously noting that if humans visit the cave, it's "more on us to not break their house rules." A minor technical debate emerged about the effectiveness of the archive link, specifically its inability to preserve the article's embedded video. Finally, the discussion touched on environmental concerns, with users debating whether humanity as a whole or specific groups ("the billionaires") are responsible for destroying such natural wonders, and noting the irony of researchers visiting a toxic environment without apparent respiratory protection.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 275 | **Comments:** 504 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An article on Ars Technica reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming its users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok. The company's official safety statement warned that users who prompt Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as those who upload it directly. However, the article notes that X has not announced any technical fixes to prevent the AI from generating such material in the first place. The piece highlights the platform's failure to implement basic safeguards, such as system prompts instructing Grok to refuse CSAM requests, and frames X's position as an abdication of responsibility for the capabilities of its own product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of X's stance, with commenters expressing a mix of outrage, cynicism, and legal analysis. The dominant sentiment is that X is shirking its responsibility by "passing the buck" to its users. Many see this as a predictable outcome of the platform's current management and culture.

Several key themes emerged in the discussion:

*   **Abdication of Responsibility:** Commenters widely condemned X's position, using analogies like "Stop asking the guy we hired to draw CSAM" to highlight the absurdity of blaming users for the AI's capabilities. The consensus is that a platform has a duty to prevent the generation of harmful content, not just react to it.
*   **Widespread Misuse of Grok:** Users provided anecdotal evidence that Grok is being used to generate non-consensual sexual imagery of public figures and ordinary people, not just CSAM. This was described as a pervasive problem on the platform, contributing to a toxic environment.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Implications:** A significant portion of the debate focused on whether Section 230 protects X in this scenario. Many argued that since Grok is an agent of the platform itself, Section 230's liability shield for third-party content should not apply. Some commenters speculated that this could lead to criminal investigations or civil liability, though others were skeptical that regulators would take action.
*   **Political and Cultural Context:** The conversation broadened into a critique of the current political climate. Several commenters argued that the platform's inaction is enabled by a broader cultural and political shift, where issues like CSAM have become partisan and are used as "culture war" fodder. They pointed to a perceived lack of enforcement from app stores and government agencies as evidence of this decline in standards.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 261 | **Comments:** 467 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang argued that the US has "done our country a great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and that the nation must create prosperity for all, not just highly educated elites. He outlined a plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to America by using government incentives, tariffs, and laws to "force" companies to build AI infrastructure within the US. The article positions this as a shift toward industrial policy to rebuild the domestic workforce and economy.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely skeptical of Jensen Huang's sudden pivot to economic patriotism. The prevailing sentiment is that his primary motivation is financial—specifically, securing government subsidies and contracts ("kiss the ring") to keep NVIDIA's stock price rising, rather than a genuine concern for the American worker.

Commenters dissected the "we" in Huang's statement, concluding he is likely referring to the "system" of free trade rather than taking personal responsibility. Several users pointed out the hypocrisy of a billionaire worth $150 billion lecturing on wealth distribution without offering to give his own money back; however, others countered that his wealth is a drop in the bucket compared to the US national debt, highlighting the scale of the economic problem.

There was a debate regarding the actual economic impact of the infrastructure Huang wants to build. While some argued that data centers provide few jobs compared to manufacturing, others noted that they still offer significant employment and bring infrastructure improvements to rural areas.

Finally, the discussion broadened to the root causes of deindustrialization, with many commenters drawing parallels to Ross Perot's 1992 warnings about the "giant sucking sound" of jobs moving overseas. The conversation touched on themes of wealth inequality, the limits of planetary resources, and a perceived loss of American industrial capability.

## [Brave overhauled its Rust adblock engine with FlatBuffers, cutting memory 75%](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/36-adblock-memory-reduction/)
**Score:** 223 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46501894

> **Article:** Brave browser published an article detailing a major overhaul of its adblock engine, which is written in Rust. The key change was replacing JSON-based filter list parsing with Google's FlatBuffers serialization format. This optimization resulted in a significant 75% reduction in memory usage, saving approximately 45 MiB for the default adblock configuration. The memory savings are expected to scale linearly with the number of additional block lists a user enables.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical impact of the memory savings, the technical architecture of the adblocker, and broader browser politics.

A primary debate was over the significance of the 45 MiB savings. Some commenters questioned its importance given modern RAM capacities and application bloat (e.g., Electron apps). However, others countered that this is a per-instance saving, and since adblockers can run in multiple processes (one per tab or site isolation), the cumulative savings across a browsing session are substantial. There was also optimism that this reflects a renewed industry focus on software efficiency, potentially driven by future hardware constraints.

The technical implementation sparked several sub-threads. Brave's use of Rust was praised as a good example of code sharing, as the engine uses crates from the Servo project (also used by Firefox) and is itself available on crates.io. This led to a debate on the Rust ecosystem's tendency towards static linking versus traditional dynamic library sharing, with concerns about memory duplication and supply-chain security.

Finally, the discussion branched into general topics about the Brave browser itself. This included clarifications on its business model (opt-in ads/rewards, not ad replacement), a call for a "de-bloated" libre version of Brave, and user feature requests like vertical tabs and mobile extension support, with Firefox being mentioned as a strong alternative.

## [ICE is using facial-recognition technology to quickly arrest people](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-facial-recognition-app-mobile-fortify-dfdd00bf)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 188 | **ID:** 46495560

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing facial-recognition technology, specifically a mobile application called "Fortify," to rapidly identify and arrest individuals. The tool allows agents to scan subjects' irises and faces in the field, comparing the data against extensive government and commercial databases to verify identities instantly. This capability has significantly accelerated ICE's arrest operations, moving the agency toward a more technologically driven enforcement model.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of ICE's use of facial recognition, framing it as a significant threat to civil liberties. The prevailing sentiment draws a sharp parallel between the U.S. government's actions and the surveillance state in China, a comparison often used to condemn the latter. A central theme is the danger of "scope creep" or the "boiling frog" scenario: users argue that while such technology might seem acceptable for catching violent criminals, its application for immigration enforcement sets a dangerous precedent that will inevitably expand to other areas of life, such as credit scoring, hiring, and general policing.

Commenters also debated the legal and ethical foundations of the practice, with some noting that it is not yet fully supported by law and targeting a population often viewed as having committed a lesser offense. Historical context was provided, linking the current use of biometrics to past civil rights violations like the warrantless fingerprinting of Black citizens in the Jim Crow era. Technical questions were raised regarding the source of the biometric data (e.g., iris scans), while some users cynically resigned themselves to the idea that privacy is already lost. A minor, diverging thread suggested that the safety benefits might be worth the trade-off, though this was quickly countered by the majority's focus on liberty and the potential for abuse.

> **Project:** Tailsnitch is an open-source security auditor for Tailscale networks. It acts as a configuration linter, analyzing a tailnet's ACLs and other settings to identify potential security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. The tool is designed to help administrators audit their networks, especially as they scale from small personal setups to larger, more complex organizational environments. It can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to provide continuous security checks.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to Tailsnitch, seeing it as a valuable tool that addresses a real need. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

There was strong agreement that this type of functionality should be native to the Tailscale platform. Users expressed a desire for a built-in "scan now" button and, more importantly, an API to expose security data for automated compliance and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) systems. The tool was seen as a great step towards filling this gap, especially for teams undergoing audits like SOC2.

The project resonated with users who have experienced "ACL anxiety" as their Tailscale networks grew. The comment "the ACL file has become terrifyingly long" captured a common fear of making mistakes in complex configurations, making a dedicated auditor a welcome solution.

Several comments expanded on the scope of what a "Tailscale security auditor" could be. One user wished for live auditd-style notices for SSH connections (e.g., who logged into an admin account), while another suggested the tool could be used for continuous compliance monitoring of the entire network tenant.

Practical concerns were also raised. One commenter pointed out the irony of a security tool requiring users to bypass macOS security protections (`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine`) and suggested running it in a VM to mitigate risk. The project author acknowledged this and mentioned a separate tool they created for that purpose.

Finally, users asked about the tool's capabilities, such as support for Headscale (the open-source Tailscale control server) and the ability to create custom checks.

## [Sega co-founder David Rosen has died](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 31 | **ID:** 46502239

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports the death of David Rosen, the American co-founder of the iconic video game company Sega. The article details Rosen's history, starting from his time as a GI in Japan after WWII, where he founded "Service Games" to provide coin-operated amusement machines for US servicemen. This eventually evolved into the Sega company, highlighting the surprising American origins of a brand widely perceived as Japanese.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by a collective sense of surprise and newfound appreciation for Sega's origins. Many commenters express shock that the company was founded by an American GI, admitting they had always assumed Sega was a purely Japanese company. This leads to reflections on the "strange history" of the company, particularly the dynamic between the American founders and the later Japanese-dominated corporate structure that often treated its Western offices as subordinate.

Beyond the historical revelations, there is a significant outpouring of nostalgia and praise for Sega's legacy. Users celebrate the company's "stellar" arcade output and influential game development teams. A key point of discussion is Sega's modern relationship with its fanbase, which is contrasted favorably with Nintendo's. Commenters highlight Sega's willingness to embrace fan projects, emulation, and even hire hackers to create official games like *Sonic Mania*, viewing this as a respectful and cool approach.

Finally, the conversation touches upon the history itself. One user recommends the book *Console Wars*, but this is immediately followed by a counterpoint from another user who cites a direct interview with David Rosen. Rosen had apparently refuted the book's narrative of internal conflict, stating that the author misunderstood the situation, and subsequently grew tired of historical inaccuracies. The thread concludes with minor meta-commentary about the HN submission process and classic Sega slogans.

## [Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/)
**Score:** 166 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46505975

> **Article:** Donut Lab has announced an all-solid-state battery with a claimed energy density of 400 Wh/kg. The announcement links to a Verge Motorcycles product, which is using this battery technology. The motorcycle is claimed to have a range of 370 miles and can add 186 miles of range in under 10 minutes. The battery is also claimed to be chargeable to full in just five minutes. The product is available for pre-order, with a base price of $35,000, and physical demo models are reportedly available at Verge stores in California.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by significant skepticism mixed with cautious optimism. The prevailing sentiment is a "huge if true" attitude, with many commenters pointing out red flags common in emerging tech announcements. Key criticisms include the lack of patents, independent testing, manufacturing details, and the fact that Donut Lab is a relatively unknown entity. Some users suspect the company is a subsidiary of Verge Motorcycles, which lends some credibility, but the lack of concrete technical details and partnerships with established brands remains a major concern.

A central point of debate is the conflicting charging claims: the lab announcement of a full charge in 5 minutes versus the motorcycle's claim of a 50% charge in 10 minutes. Commenters speculate this could be due to thermal management differences or that one claim is a marketing exaggeration. While some users note that the ability to physically see and test-ride the motorcycle at a retail location suggests the project is not pure vaporware, others remain unconvinced, citing a long history of revolutionary battery technologies failing to materialize. The discussion concludes with a general consensus to wait for real-world validation and wider adoption.
