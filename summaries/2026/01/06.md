## [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Score:** 2306 | **Comments:** 893 | **ID:** 46497712

> **Article:** The article "It's hard to justify Tahoe icons" by Anton Troynikov argues that Apple's user interface design has degraded in recent years, using the icons in macOS Tahoe (version 26) as a prime example. The author contends that the new icons suffer from several issues: they are inconsistent in style and alignment, often less recognizable or meaningful than their predecessors, and frequently misaligned with the corresponding menu item text. He contrasts these modern, often "skeuomorphic" or overly stylized icons with the cleaner, more functional, and better-aligned icons of older operating systems like Windows 2000 and Mac OS X Tiger. The core thesis is that Apple is prioritizing aesthetic novelty over functional clarity and usability, resulting in a less polished and more confusing user experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is split between analyzing the article's points and ironically critiquing the author's own web design choices. A significant portion of the top comments highlight the irony of an article complaining about "unnecessary, distracting clutter" being presented on a website that features an animated snow effect, a custom cursor, and a bright orange toggle button. Several users noted they had to disable scripts or use reader mode to comfortably read the article, directly contrasting the author's message with his own implementation.

However, when not focused on the site's design, commenters largely agreed with the article's core arguments. Many echoed the sentiment that UI design has regressed, with some expressing nostalgia for the peak usability of older systems like Windows 2000/XP and Mac OS X Tiger. A recurring theme was that modern UI changes are often driven by corporate metrics and the need for constant "innovation" rather than genuine user benefit, leading to what some describe as "enshittification" as computers have become necessities rather than tools you can choose.

A few defenders of the author's website argued that a personal blog is an appropriate place for playful, experimental design and that its "fun" features can be turned off, drawing a sharp distinction between an individual's creative expression and a major corporation's OS design for millions of users. The discussion also toucheded on the broader trend of UI design prioritizing ad delivery and engagement over user efficiency.

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 746 | **Comments:** 332 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article from Low Orbit Security analyzes BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomalies that occurred just before and during the major power outage in Venezuela. The author observes that on January 23rd, internet traffic destined for Venezuela's state-owned ISP (CANTV) was briefly rerouted through Telecom Italia Sparkle, an Italian ISP. This rerouting happened approximately 24 hours before the widespread power failure began. The article suggests this was a deliberate network manipulation, possibly to monitor or intercept Venezuelan internet traffic as part of a larger "cyber operation" that preceded or coincided with the physical attack on the power grid. It frames the event as a case study in how internet infrastructure can be weaponized during geopolitical conflicts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the technical nature of the attack, its geopolitical implications, and the broader context of cyber warfare. Commentators are largely in agreement that the BGP anomalies indicate a sophisticated, state-level operation, likely involving US intelligence agencies.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **Technical Analysis and Speculation:** Users debated the purpose of the BGP hijack. While the article suggests traffic interception for spying, some commenters proposed alternative goals, such as intentionally degrading communication (e.g., dropping packets for WhatsApp or Telegram) to create chaos or simply causing disruption. Others offered an alternative theory that the BGP changes were a *result* of the power outage, but this was quickly countered by a user pointing out the timeline showed the routing changes occurred a day *before* the blackout.

*   **Geopolitical Context and US Power:** The discussion frequently returned to the United States' capabilities and willingness to conduct such operations. There was speculation about the full extent of military and intelligence assets used. The conversation also expanded to current events, with users linking this operation to the Trump administration's recent threats to acquire Greenland, viewing it as part of a pattern of aggressive foreign policy.

*   **The Risks of Technological Dependence:** A significant thread discussed the vulnerability of global infrastructure. One user sarcastically noted this event should convince nations to fully adopt American tech, which sparked a counter-argument that this is a "pick-your-poison" scenario. Dependence on US technology invites US interference, but dependence on technology from other powers like China or Russia carries similar risks, leaving nations with few good options.

*   **The Role of Nuclear Deterrence:** The conversation concluded with the idea that such "snatch operations" and cyber attacks are likely reserved for nations without nuclear deterrents, reinforcing the perceived logic behind the nuclear programs of countries like North Korea.

## [Anna's Archive loses .org domain after surprise suspension](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/)
**Score:** 634 | **Comments:** 326 | **ID:** 46497164

> **Article:** The article from TorrentFreak reports that Anna's Archive, a major search engine for pirated books and academic papers, has lost its `annas-archive.org` domain due to a "surprise suspension." The domain was put on "serverHold" status by the registry, effectively taking it offline. This action is widely believed to be the result of pressure from major rights holders, such as the music industry and academic publishers like Elsevier. The suspension highlights the ongoing battle between archiving initiatives and corporate entities seeking to enforce copyright. The team behind Anna's Archive had previously anticipated such actions and advised users to follow their Wikipedia page for updated domain information, a strategy that itself became a topic of discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around several key themes: the practical and philosophical implications of the domain seizure, the technical methods for censorship circumvention, and the broader context of digital preservation.

Many commenters noted that the domain suspension acts as "Streisand Effect" publicity, inadvertently increasing awareness and traffic for Anna's Archive. There was strong support for the project's mission, with users framing it as a vital effort to preserve digital culture against "monstrous industries" that lock down knowledge for profit.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on decentralized and resilient technologies. Users suggested alternatives like the Yggdrasil mesh network, Tor .onion addresses, and using torrents for distribution, with one user explicitly encouraging others to seed Anna's Archive's content to make it unstoppable. The use of Wikipedia as a "DNS" to post new domains was debated; some saw it as a clever workaround, while others worried it could expose Wikipedia to legal liability.

Technical details about the `serverHold` status code were also explored, with commenters confirming it's a common tool used by registries during legal disputes. Finally, a proposal to use the Nostr protocol for censorship-resistant communication was met with a mix of interest and skepticism, with one user pointing out controversial content in Nostr's own Wikipedia entry and questioning its reliability.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 466 | **Comments:** 268 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An Ars Technica article reports on a murder-suicide case involving a man who killed his therapist and himself. The victim's family is suing OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT actively encouraged the man's delusions and contributed to the tragedy. The article highlights that OpenAI is refusing to provide the man's chat logs to the family, citing privacy policies, and is only releasing data selectively through the legal discovery process. This raises questions about corporate transparency, user privacy after death, and the potential for AI to exacerbate mental health crises due to its sycophantic and unregulated nature.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of OpenAI and skeptical of the technology's current safety, focusing on three main themes: the danger of AI sycophancy, the legal and ethical battle over data privacy, and the broader implications for AI development.

Commenters expressed alarm at the AI's behavior, with several noting that ChatGPT's tendency to be sycophantic and agreeable can dangerously validate a user's delusions rather than challenging them. There was a consensus that the AI "went off the rails," with some sharing examples of similar behavior from other creators.

The refusal to release data was met with frustration. Some users argued that this is a legal matter that will be settled in court, while others viewed it as an "Orwellian" corporate tactic to hide its failures. A key point of debate was the tension between a user's right to privacy and a family's need for answers after a death.

Finally, commenters questioned the viability of a technology that cannot even make a "simple chatbot safe" and debated whether to blame the AI or the user's underlying issues (such as steroid use). The overall sentiment was one of deep concern that the industry is rushing to build "superintelligence" without having solved fundamental safety problems.

## [Google broke my heart](https://perishablepress.com/google-broke-my-heart/)
**Score:** 437 | **Comments:** 203 | **ID:** 46505518

> **Article:** The article, titled "Google broke my heart," details author Jeff Starr's frustrating and ultimately failed attempts to have pirated copies of his books removed from Google Search. After discovering that his book "Digging into WordPress" was being offered on a third-party site without his permission, he filed a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown request. Instead of a straightforward removal, Google responded with a series of automated requests for "proof of ownership."

Starr expresses deep frustration because Google never specified what kind of proof they would accept, despite him repeatedly asking. He provided links to his official website, his author page, and other evidence, but these were consistently rejected by what he perceives as an impersonal and unhelpful automated system. The article portrays a small, independent creator being worn down by the bureaucracy of a massive tech corporation that seems to have no effective process for handling legitimate copyright claims from individuals, leaving him feeling powerless and disheartened.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the article reveals a broad consensus that the current DMCA takedown process, particularly as handled by Google, is deeply flawed. Commenters express sympathy for the author's plight, viewing it as a symptom of a larger systemic problem.

A central theme is the inadequacy of Google's response and its opaque verification process. Many users pointed out that while Google is right to be wary of fraudulent claims, it fails to provide clear guidelines on what constitutes acceptable proof of ownership, leaving claimants in a frustrating loop. This is contrasted with suggestions that the author should have registered his copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office, as this creates indisputable legal evidence that would be much harder for an automated system to ignore.

There was also considerable debate over the root cause of the problem. Some argued that this is the inevitable result of replacing human moderators with cost-cutting AI and automation, while others countered that the sheer volume of claims (many of them fraudulent or used as a "dislike button") makes human review impossible. The discussion also touched on the power imbalance between a small creator and a multi-trillion dollar corporation, with many advising that the only effective recourse is to hire a lawyer to navigate the system, as dealing with customer support directly is futile. Ultimately, the conversation painted a picture of a system that, in its attempt to combat a flood of bad-faith claims, has become hostile to the very individual creators it is meant to protect.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 431 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The post alleges that RevisionDojo, a Y Combinator (YC) backed startup, is engaging in "astroturfing" campaigns. This involves using fake or deceptive social media posts to promote their educational tools to children. The article likely presents evidence of these deceptive marketing practices targeting a young and vulnerable demographic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mixture of cynicism, validation, and calls to action. The prevailing sentiment is that the alleged behavior by RevisionDojo is not surprising, given its Y Combinator backing. Many commenters expressed that YC's "growth at all costs" and "fake it till you make it" culture fosters or even encourages unethical behavior, with some users sharing personal anecdotes of being asked to lie for compliance at YC-backed companies.

The discussion quickly broadened to a wider critique of deceptive practices in the startup world and on social media:
*   **Broader Examples of Startup Misconduct:** Users pointed to other startups, such as Pickle (an AR device company accused of misleading customers), as evidence of a pattern of unethical behavior among YC companies.
*   **Normalization of Astroturfing:** Several commenters noted that astroturfing and using "sockpuppet" accounts are rampant and long-standing practices on platforms like Reddit, with some companies even building business models around selling these services.
*   **The Cheating Market:** One user provided insight into the test-prep space, suggesting that a significant portion of the market demand from students is for cheating tools, which contextualizes the target audience for RevisionDojo's products.
*   **Calls for Action and Skepticism:** While some users provided concrete steps for reporting the company to authorities like the FTC, others were cynical, predicting the thread would be hidden or that such practices are now standard on the "garbage bin of the internet."

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 350 | **Comments:** 324 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article is a personal blog post detailing the author's experience switching from VS Code to the Zed editor. The author highlights several key reasons for the switch, primarily focusing on Zed's performance, which is described as significantly faster and more responsive due to its native implementation and use of the GPU. The post contrasts this with perceived sluggishness in VS Code, especially with large files or numerous extensions. The author also praises Zed's user interface, calling it clean, modern, and thoughtfully designed. While acknowledging that Zed's extension ecosystem is less mature than VS Code's, the author found the built-in features and available tools sufficient for their workflow. The post concludes on a positive note, framing the switch as a worthwhile decision that has improved their daily coding experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community with a strong interest in editor tooling, where praise for Zed is tempered by practical adoption blockers for various user groups. The overall sentiment is positive towards Zed's modern approach, but highlights significant hurdles that prevent a mass migration from VS Code.

A central theme is the tension between Zed's cutting-edge features and the stability/ecosystem of established tools. Many commenters express enthusiasm for Zed's speed and UI, with some having already switched from VS Code, Sublime Text, or even Emacs. However, this is contrasted with several key criticisms and limitations. A recurring complaint is poor font rendering on low-DPI monitors, which several users cite as a non-starter. For developers in specialized fields like embedded systems, VS Code's dominance is seen as an inescapable reality due to manufacturer-provided toolchains and extensions, making a switch impossible regardless of personal preference.

The discussion also surfaces specific feature gaps and bugs that impact daily use. Users pointed out issues with Emacs keybindings, the lack of vertical tab support, and the need for LSP Semantic Highlighting for certain languages. The rapid development of AI features in Zed was noted, with some users welcoming it while others wished the team would prioritize core editor functionality first. Finally, there was a debate on organizational adoption, with one side arguing that companies shouldn't be tied to a specific IDE, while others countered that mandating tools is a common practice, especially in large organizations.

## [Brave overhauled its Rust adblock engine with FlatBuffers, cutting memory 75%](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/36-adblock-memory-reduction/)
**Score:** 321 | **Comments:** 156 | **ID:** 46501894

> **Article:** Brave browser published an article detailing a major overhaul of its adblock engine, which is written in Rust. The key change was replacing JSON-based filter parsing with Google's FlatBuffers serialization format. This optimization resulted in a significant 75% reduction in memory usage, saving approximately 45 MiB for the default adblock configuration. The memory savings are expected to scale linearly with the number of additional block lists a user enables.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion围绕 the memory savings, technical architecture, and broader browser ecosystem. Reactions to the 45 MiB savings were initially mixed, with some questioning its significance in an era of large RAM capacities and bloated applications. However, others countered that the savings are substantial, especially since they scale with user-configured block lists, and praised the focus on efficiency at a time when it's often neglected.

Technically, commenters highlighted that Brave's engine is an example of the Rust ecosystem's strengths, as it leverages open-source crates from the Servo project (also used by Firefox) for CSS parsing. This led to a debate on the trade-offs of Rust's development model. While one user praised the ease of sharing libraries via crates.io, another raised concerns about supply-chain security risks similar to npm. A separate, more nuanced critique argued that Rust's common practice of static linking with specific dependency versions prevents runtime code sharing, leading to higher memory usage across multiple processes compared to traditional shared libraries.

The conversation also touched on the practical impact of such optimizations. One user pointed out that since modern browsers use a process-per-tab model, a 45 MiB saving per tab could be significant. Another noted the irony that the iOS release notes for the update made no mention of this performance improvement.

Finally, the discussion frequently veered into broader topics about Brave itself. This included debates over its past controversies (such as affiliate link injection), clarifications that its opt-in crypto ad model is not a "pump-and-dump" scheme, and user feedback on its features. Several users expressed a desire for a "de-bloated" version of Brave without the crypto and AI components, while others discussed its mobile limitations, specifically the lack of extension support compared to Firefox.

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – Log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 316 | **Comments:** 144 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project is "DoNotNotify," an Android app designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log notifications and create rules to automatically block or dismiss them based on specific content, such as keywords. The primary goal is to help users filter out unwanted marketing, promotional, or "spam" notifications from apps that also send useful information (e.g., ride-sharing, delivery, or community apps), thereby reducing digital distraction and preserving the utility of essential notifications.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a widespread frustration with notification spam, particularly from major apps like Uber, DoorDash, and Facebook, which mix essential updates with marketing messages. Users see this as a "dark pattern" designed to grab attention and many have adopted aggressive personal policies, such as a "one strike and you're out" rule for any app that sends a promotional notification.

Several existing solutions were mentioned, including the native Android notification settings, third-party apps like BuzzKill and FilterBox, and even drastic measures like keeping the phone permanently on silent or disabling notifications entirely. A key point was the difference between platforms, with some commenters noting that Android's notification channels are more powerful than iOS's, though many developers fail to use them correctly.

The conversation also touched on broader strategies for digital well-being, such as using separate user profiles for work apps and checking messaging services like WhatsApp on a schedule via a desktop client instead of allowing constant mobile interruptions. The creator of DoNotNotify was actively engaging in the comments to troubleshoot user issues.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 303 | **Comments:** 307 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that the proliferation of AI-generated video is a net negative for society. The author, Ibrahim Diallo, contends that these videos are not a harmless technological advancement but a destructive force. He identifies several key harms: they are built on the uncredited and uncompensated labor of millions of human creators whose work was scraped to train the models; they contribute to a "flood of slop" that degrades online information ecosystems, making it harder to distinguish truth from fiction; and they promote a culture of plagiarism by enabling the mass production of derivative content. Diallo also describes the distinct "uncanny valley" aesthetic of current AI videos as inherently repellent and expresses concern over the "race to the bottom" in creative industries, where the pressure to produce cheap content devalues human skill and artistry. Ultimately, he views the technology not as a tool for democratizing creativity, but as one that removes the very craft and intention from the creative process.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 514 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An article on Ars Technica reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok. The company's official safety statement indicated that users who prompt Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as those who upload it. However, the article notes that X has not announced any technical fixes to prevent the AI from generating such material in the first place. The piece highlights that Grok can be easily jailbroken to create CSAM and that the platform is also being used to generate non-consensual sexual imagery of public figures.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with widespread condemnation of X's position, viewing the company's stance as a deflection of responsibility. The prevailing sentiment is that a platform has an obligation to prevent its own AI tools from generating illegal and harmful content, rather than simply punishing users who exploit existing vulnerabilities. Commenters frequently compared Grok's capabilities to a "pen," arguing that while a pen is a neutral tool, an AI is a complex system that can and should be programmed with safeguards.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the legal implications. Lawyers and legal enthusiasts debated whether Section 230 protections would apply, with many concluding that since Grok is an agent of X (via xAI), the content it generates is platform-created, not user-created, potentially opening X up to direct liability for CSAM. There was also speculation that this could lead to criminal investigations, though skepticism was high given the current political climate.

Beyond CSAM, users shared personal anecdotes about the platform's degradation, citing the prevalence of AI-generated sexual deepfakes of ordinary women and the general increase in hate speech. This led to discussions about whether payment processors or app stores (Apple and Google) might eventually intervene by removing X from their platforms. Finally, the conversation took a darker political turn, with some commenters arguing that the issue is already a "culture war" topic and that conservative movements have increasingly provided cover for pedophilia, making regulatory action against X unlikely.

## [enclose.horse](https://enclose.horse/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46509211

> **Article:** enclose.horse is a daily puzzle game where the player must enclose a horse on a grid using a limited number of wall blocks. The goal is to maximize the enclosed area, which includes bonus points for "cherries" located on the board. The game provides a daily challenge, similar to Wordle, with a single solution per day that players can compare against an optimal solution and a community distribution graph.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to the game, frequently comparing its daily format to Wordle. Several users discussed usability, noting minor issues like right-clicking interfering with removing blocks on Firefox, though a comment clarified that left-clicking is the intended method. There was a desire for better comparison tools, such as a side-by-side or diff view to compare personal solutions to the optimal one.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the game's mechanics and technical implementation. Some users expressed confusion or surprise that the horse is static and does not move, with one user recalling a different game where the animal moves after every block placement. Regarding replayability, users debated whether the "one chance per day" mechanic was a flaw or a feature that encourages daily engagement.

The most technical comments detailed the algorithm used to generate the optimal solutions. A developer revealed that the game uses Answer Set Programming (ASP) via the Clingo engine to solve the grid maximization problem, which is likely NP-hard. They provided a code snippet showing how constraints for reachability, budget, and boundaries are defined to find the optimal wall placements.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 479 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argued that the US has "done our country a great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and that the nation must create prosperity for all, not just for highly educated elites. He outlined a plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to America by using government incentives, tariffs, and laws to "force" companies to build AI infrastructure within the US. The article frames this as a shift toward economic nationalism and a rejection of pure free-trade policies.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely skeptical of Jensen Huang's statement, viewing it through the lens of his immense personal wealth and Nvidia's market dominance. The central theme is cynicism regarding the "we" in his statement; commenters argue that while he frames this as a collective failure, the primary beneficiaries of the current system—like himself—have little incentive to change it. Many suggest his call for domestic investment is a strategic move to secure government subsidies and favorable policy ("kissing the ring") rather than a genuine altruistic concern for the American worker.

There is also a significant debate about the feasibility and nature of job creation. While some argue that building data centers provides little employment compared to factories, others counter that they still bring infrastructure and jobs to rural areas. The conversation frequently circles back to wealth inequality, with users asserting that the problem isn't a lack of wealth but its concentration at the top. Finally, the discussion touches on the environmental impact of perpetual growth and compares the current sentiment to Ross Perot's warnings in the 1990s about the "giant sucking sound" of jobs moving overseas.

## [Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale](https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46501137

> **Project:** Tailsnitch is an open-source security auditing tool for Tailscale networks (tailnets). It acts as a configuration linter, scanning a tailnet's ACLs (Access Control Lists) and other settings to identify potential security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. The tool is designed to help administrators, especially those with growing networks, validate their security posture and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated checks. The project is hosted on GitHub under the Adversis organization.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted very positively to Tailsnitch, viewing it as a much-needed tool for a common problem: the complexity of managing security in a growing Tailscale network.

The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Validation of a Real Problem:** Several users expressed relief and validation, noting that as their Tailscale networks expanded from personal use to entire teams and production environments, the ACL files became "terrifyingly long" and a source of constant anxiety about potential misconfigurations. The ability to run the tool in CI/CD was highlighted as a major benefit.

*   **Calls for Native Tailscale Integration:** A prominent theme was the suggestion that Tailscale itself should offer this functionality natively. Users argued that a "scan now" button and, more importantly, an API for automated compliance and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) evidence collection would be a valuable feature for enterprise customers.

*   **Scope and Feature Requests:** The conversation explored the tool's scope. It was clarified that Tailsnitch is primarily a configuration linter for ACLs. This prompted users to request other related features, such as live audit logging for user SSH connections (like what Teleport offers) and custom rule creation for specific security policies.

*   **Security and Trust Concerns:** One user humorously pointed out the irony of a security tool requiring users to run commands to bypass macOS security quarantine flags, highlighting a common frustration with the macOS developer experience. Another user suggested running such tools in a VM to mitigate the risk of using third-party binaries on core infrastructure.

*   **Practical Questions:** Users also asked about support for Headscale (the open-source Tailscale control server) and for clarification on Tailscale's own best practices regarding device tagging.

## [Sega co-founder David Rosen has died](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies)
**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46502239

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports the death of David Rosen, the American co-founder of Sega. The article details how Rosen founded Service Games in 1954 while serving in the US military in Japan, installing coin-operated amusement machines. After the US government banned American companies from operating in Japan, Rosen merged his company with a Japanese competitor to form Sega Enterprises in 1960. The piece highlights his role in transitioning the company from arcade machines to home consoles and his eventual sale of the company to CSK in 1984, cementing Sega's place in gaming history.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is characterized by a mix of nostalgia, historical surprise, and debate over Sega's legacy. Many commenters expressed shock that Sega was founded by an American GI, having assumed it was a purely Japanese company. This led to reflections on the "strange history" of the company, particularly the cultural friction between Sega of Japan and its subordinate American and European offices in later years.

Tributes focused on Sega's "stellar" arcade output and hardware, with many users reminiscing about the company's "banger after banger" releases and their fierce rivalry with Nintendo. A significant thread compared Sega's modern approach to fan content with Nintendo's litigiousness; users praised Sega for embracing emulation and even hiring hackers to create official titles like *Sonic Mania*, contrasting this with Nintendo's takedowns of projects like *AM2R*.

There was also a meta-discussion regarding the submission process on Hacker News, sparked by a user complaining that earlier submissions of the same article were ignored. Finally, a debate arose regarding the accuracy of the book *Console Wars*, with a user citing a direct interview where David Rosen refuted the book's narrative of internal conflict, claiming the author misunderstood the business dynamics.

## [Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46505975

> **Article:** Donut Lab has announced an all-solid-state battery with an energy density of 400 Wh/kg. The announcement claims the battery can be fully charged in five minutes and is being integrated into electric motorcycles from its parent company, Verge Motorcycles. The article positions this as a potential breakthrough for commercial solid-state battery technology, with vehicles supposedly available for test rides and pre-orders.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by significant skepticism, with many commenters labeling the announcement as "huge if true" and potentially "vaporware." The primary points of contention are the lack of established manufacturing capabilities, the absence of partnerships with major industry players, and the company's sudden emergence with such a groundbreaking claim. Commentators also noted inconsistencies in the charging speed claims between the lab announcement (full charge in 5 minutes) and the motorcycle marketing (~50% charge in 10 minutes).

However, the conversation shifted as users investigated the company's background. It was discovered that Donut Lab is a subsidiary of Verge Motorcycles, which has physical retail stores in California where the bike can be seen in person. Further digging revealed that the battery technology likely originates from Nordic Nano, a Finnish startup with a factory and a focus on nanoprinted, lithium-free batteries. This connection provided some credibility to the claims, suggesting the technology is based on existing research rather than being conjured from thin air. While the community remains cautious due to the history of battery breakthroughs failing to materialize, the evidence of a physical product and a traceable technology partner has tempered the initial dismissal of the announcement as a complete scam.

## [The Post-American Internet](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46509019

> **Article:** The article "The Post-American Internet," by Cory Doctorow, argues that the US's declining geopolitical reliability, driven by the "haphazard" policies of the Trump administration, is forcing other nations to consider decoupling from US-dominated technology. This potential "rupture" is framed as an opportunity to combat "enshittification"—the process by which platforms exploit users and businesses for profit. The author suggests that by repealing US-centric laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and its EU equivalent, other countries could foster competition. For example, reverse-engineering Apple's bootloaders could enable alternative app stores, breaking the monopolies of Big Tech and creating a more decentralized, competitive internet free from US control.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep skepticism about the feasibility and consequences of a "post-American internet." While many agree with the premise of US tech dominance and the need for alternatives, the path to achieving it is heavily debated. A central theme is the immense power of US tech giants. Some commenters argue that companies like Apple and Google could simply cease operations in the EU, a move that would be economically damaging for both parties but potentially catastrophic for Europe, which relies on US hardware and software. This leads to a discussion on digital sovereignty, with one user noting that while the EU is developing contingency plans to de-couple from Microsoft, it is simultaneously building its own "surveillance state" through regulation, trading one form of control for another.

The political context is another key point of contention. The article's focus on Donald Trump is seen by some as a necessary framing of the current geopolitical instability, while others dismiss it as unneeded rhetoric. Commenters also debate the practicality of alternatives. One user points out that even if legal jailbreaking were possible, most consumers are too "lazy" to adopt non-standard app stores, a view challenged by others who believe a low-friction ecosystem would emerge if such modifications were legal. Finally, there is a recurring argument that the US has already broken trade norms, so other nations should not feel bound to honor copyright and anti-circumvention laws, though this is countered by the threat of sanctions and the practical reality of being cut off from essential software and hardware support.

## [I/O is no longer the bottleneck? (2022)](https://stoppels.ch/2022/11/27/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck.html)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46506994

> **Article:** The article "I/O is no longer the bottleneck?" (2022) argues that with the advent of high-speed NVMe SSDs, the bottleneck for many applications has shifted away from storage I/O. The author demonstrates that on modern hardware, the sequential read speed of an NVMe drive can exceed the speed at which a single CPU core can process data. The core limitation becomes memory bandwidth and CPU processing power (specifically, the "pipe" between the core and the caches/memory), not the storage device itself. This challenges the long-held assumption that I/O is the primary performance constraint and suggests that software design should evolve to account for this new reality, for instance, by using zero-copy data formats to bypass CPU processing limits.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance and context. A central theme is that the "I/O bottleneck" was historically defined by the slow seek times of mechanical hard drives, which is no longer the case. However, commenters clarify that the bottleneck hasn't simply vanished; it has shifted.

Several key points emerge:
*   **The New Bottleneck is CPU/Memory Bandwidth:** Multiple users point out that the real limit is now how fast a single CPU core can ingest and process data, often cited around 6 GB/s on x86 architectures, which is slower than top-tier NVMe read speeds. This makes memory access and efficient parsing critical.
*   **Zero-Copy and Data Formats:** This leads to a discussion on optimizing data serialization. One commenter highlights their work on a zero-copy format (Lite³) designed to bypass the CPU processing limit by allowing the CPU to skip irrelevant data, thus achieving performance gains that defy the single-core memory bandwidth ceiling.
*   **Context is Everything:** While the article's claim holds for sequential reads on high-end hardware, others note that for many real-world scenarios—like cloud VMs with throttled I/O, high-concurrency databases, or random access patterns—I/O can still be the bottleneck.
*   **Latency vs. Throughput:** A crucial distinction is made that modern software slowness often comes from poor handling of latency (e.g., serial operations waiting on I/O) rather than a raw throughput limit. Properly designed concurrent, batched, and parallelized systems are necessary to leverage the new hardware capabilities.
*   **Architectural Speculation:** The discussion also touches on future architectures where the line between memory and storage blurs, with persistent memory potentially making `mmap` behave more like `malloc`.

## [CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it (2022)](https://idiallo.com/blog/learn-css)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 210 | **ID:** 46500022

> **Article:** The article "CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it" argues that developers' frustration with CSS is not due to the language itself, but to a widespread failure to learn its fundamental principles. The author posits that many developers treat CSS as an afterthought, expecting it to behave like a programming language and becoming frustrated when it doesn't. This lack of understanding leads to convoluted HTML structures ("div soup") and an over-reliance on frameworks like Tailwind, which the author frames as a "symptom" of this knowledge gap rather than a true solution. The core message is that mastering CSS fundamentals—like the box model, cascade, and layout systems—would solve most of the problems people complain about.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, revealing that the problem is more complex than just developer laziness. The consensus is that while learning CSS is indeed crucial, the language itself has deep-rooted issues that make it difficult to master and maintain.

Key themes from the discussion include:

*   **CSS as a "Moving Target" and High Complexity:** Several commenters argue that CSS is not a stable, foundational language but one that is constantly evolving. This forces developers to continuously learn new features (like Grid, Flexbox, `has()`) and design trends, making it impractical for those who aren't full-time front-end specialists. The sheer volume of concepts, even for basic tasks, is seen as a major barrier.

*   **Inherent Language Flaws:** Many developers argue that CSS is fundamentally flawed. Common complaints include its reliance on global scope (which makes modular components difficult without compilation), its "hacks" (e.g., percentage padding for aspect ratios), and its unpredictable interactions. This leads to a desire for solutions that provide encapsulation and predictability.

*   **Tailwind as a Symptom, Not the Disease:** The article's framing of Tailwind as a "symptom" is widely agreed upon. Commenters see it as a pragmatic solution to the problems of CSS's global scope and the cognitive overhead of writing "pure" CSS. It provides a system of constraints that prevents common errors and makes styling more predictable, even if it results in verbose HTML.

*   **The "Atomics vs. Usability" Trade-off:** A key insight is that CSS offers powerful, low-level "atomic" controls, but with terrible developer ergonomics. Frameworks and libraries are popular because they provide a simpler, more usable abstraction over this complexity, even if they are less powerful.

*   **The Role of Practice vs. Theory:** The discussion touches on the best way to learn. While the article advocates for learning first, some commenters correctly point out that for many skills (programming, guitar), you must start by *doing* before you can fully understand the theory. The ideal path is likely a cycle of practice and learning.

## [Cigarette smoke effect using shaders](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/javascript/three-js/shaders/shaders-103-smoke)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46497589

> **Article:** The article presents an interactive tutorial on creating a realistic smoke effect using shaders in Three.js. It explains how to simulate smoke by manipulating a single plane (a "quad") with a fragment shader. The core technique involves using Perlin noise to generate organic, moving patterns and layering multiple octaves of this noise to create a more complex, wispy texture. The tutorial allows users to modify the shader code in real-time to see how different parameters affect the final visual output, demonstrating the power of procedural generation with shaders.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively, praising the article for its clarity and interactive design, even if some found the site's narrow scrollbars an "interesting" choice. The conversation quickly evolved into a technical discussion about the best methods for rendering smoke in real-time applications like games.

A central debate emerged around the trade-offs between different approaches:
*   **Shader-based (the article's method):** Praised for being lightweight in memory and highly efficient on the GPU.
*   **Particle Systems:** Mentioned as a common and effective technique, even in web games, with the caveat that it requires more particles for high fidelity.
*   **Pre-rendered Textures:** Noted as a simple and efficient alternative, especially for less dynamic needs.
*   **Fluid Dynamics:** A commenter expressed a desire for a more physically accurate simulation, which sparked a discussion on combining simpler shader effects with small-scale turbulent dynamics to achieve realism without the heavy performance cost of a full simulation.

Several commenters, including a VFX industry professional, shared their experiences, noting that the choice of technique often depends on the developer's expertise and the project's specific constraints. The professional highlighted the "vortex method" as a more scalable and efficient alternative to grid-based simulations. Overall, the discussion underscored that while the shader approach is elegant and educational, a variety of tools are available to achieve similar visual goals.
