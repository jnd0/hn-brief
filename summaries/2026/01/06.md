## [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Score:** 2269 | **Comments:** 881 | **ID:** 46497712

> **Article:** The article "It's hard to justify Tahoe icons" by Anton Troynikov argues that Apple's user interface design, specifically in macOS (referencing the "Tahoe" codename for an upcoming release), has regressed in usability and consistency. The author critiques the modern trend of removing icons from menu items, which he claims breaks a long-standing, effective design pattern. He demonstrates how this leads to misaligned text and a loss of quick visual cues that helped users navigate menus efficiently. The piece contrasts this with older, more functional UIs (like Office 2000) and even Apple's own past, suggesting that the current design prioritizes a minimalist aesthetic over practical utility, ultimately making the OS harder to use.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by a significant meta-irony: many commenters point out the hypocrisy of an article criticizing distracting UI elements being presented on a website with its own distracting, non-essential features, namely a full-screen animated snow effect. This sparked a debate about the difference between a personal blog and a major operating system, with some defending the author's right to have "fun" on their own site while others argue it undermines the article's core message about usability.

Beyond the irony, commenters largely agree with the article's central thesis. There is a strong sentiment of nostalgia for older, more functional UIs from the Windows 2000/XP and classic Mac OS eras. The conversation broadens into a critique of modern software design in general, with users suggesting that UI changes are often driven by corporate metrics and the need for constant "innovation" rather than user benefit. Some commenters also offered practical solutions, such as trying alternative operating systems like KDE/Qt which are perceived to handle these UI details better.

## [Anna's Archive loses .org domain after surprise suspension](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/)
**Score:** 626 | **Comments:** 318 | **ID:** 46497164

> **Article:** The article from TorrentFreak reports that Anna's Archive, a major search engine for pirated books and academic papers, has lost its `annas-archive.org` domain. The domain was suspended by its registrar due to a "ServerHold" status, which is typically imposed in response to legal pressure from copyright holders. The article notes that the site remains accessible via its `.se` domain and other mirrors. The suspension is attributed to pressure from major music labels and academic publishers like Elsevier. The piece also mentions that such actions often backfire by increasing publicity and traffic for the targeted service, a phenomenon known as the "Streisand effect."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the domain suspension, its implications, and potential censorship-resistant solutions. A central theme is the Streisand effect, with multiple users noting that the suspension serves as great publicity, introducing Anna's Archive to a wider audience who may now seek to support it.

Several technical and legal workarounds were proposed and debated. Users pointed to alternative access methods like the `.se` domain, `open-slum.org`, Tor `.onion` sites, and decentralized networks like Yggdrasil and Nostr. The use of Wikipedia as a "DNS" to list current domains was discussed, with some seeing it as a clever use of a stable resource while others worried it could expose Wikipedia to legal liability. The conversation also touched on the mechanics of the takedown, identifying the "ServerHold" status as a common tool used by registries in response to court orders.

A strong undercurrent of the discussion was ideological. Commenters expressed support for Anna's Archive's mission of preserving digital culture against "monstrous industries" that lock down content for profit. The idea of community-driven preservation through seeding torrents was heavily promoted as a way to make the content resilient to domain-level attacks. Finally, a minor but notable side-discussion emerged about the Nostr protocol's Wikipedia page, with one user accusing it of containing a "smear campaign" against the protocol's creator.

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 625 | **Comments:** 310 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article, from Low Orbit Security, analyzes BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomalies that occurred on May 3, 2019, coinciding with a failed attempt to overthrow Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The author observes that just before the event, internet traffic destined for Venezuelan ISP CANTV was briefly rerouted through networks belonging to Telecom Italia Sparkle and GlobeNet. The article posits that this BGP hijack was a deliberate component of the operation, potentially intended to monitor, intercept, or disrupt communications (such as WhatsApp and Telegram) during the critical window of the coup attempt, without needing to compromise the network infrastructure within Venezuela itself.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the technical nature of the alleged attack, the broader implications of cyber warfare, and the geopolitical context. Commentators are largely in agreement that the BGP anomalies were likely a deliberate tactic, speculating on their purpose, which ranged from passive surveillance of traffic to actively disrupting critical communication channels like WhatsApp to sow chaos. The technical security of BGP itself was criticized as a fundamental vulnerability that enables such operations.

The conversation quickly expanded beyond Venezuela. Many commenters connected the event to the Trump administration's foreign policy, with a significant thread discussing threats against Greenland and Canada as examples of a pattern of aggressive geopolitical maneuvering. The discussion on cyber warfare's potential was stark, with users noting that major powers already have plans to disable enemy infrastructure, referencing historical precedents like graphite bombs used in past conflicts and the Stuxnet worm. The debate also touched on the role of nuclear deterrence, with some arguing it's the ultimate protection, while others countered that cyber attacks persist regardless.

Finally, the discussion addressed technological dependency. One user framed the incident as a warning against relying on American technology, but this was countered by the argument that all major tech blocs (US, China, Russia) present similar geopolitical risks, creating a "pick-your-poison" scenario for nations without native technological capacity. The consensus was that avoiding dependency on a geopolitical rival's tech stack is a prudent strategy for any nation.

## [Databases in 2025: A Year in Review](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html)
**Score:** 574 | **Comments:** 154 | **ID:** 46496103

> **Article:** This article by Andy Pavlo provides a retrospective of the database landscape in 2025. The central theme is the massive disruption caused by AI, particularly the rise of Model Context Protocols (MCP), which allow LLMs to directly query and manipulate databases. Pavlo argues this creates a new security paradigm, comparing the risks to SQL injection but originating from model hallucinations rather than malicious users. He also covers major industry movements, including acquisitions (like Databricks buying Neon and Vercel acquiring Gel), the maturation of PostgreSQL extensions (such as pg_vector for AI and pg_duckdb for analytics), and the continued growth of "boring" but reliable technologies like SQLite. The article concludes that while innovation is rapid, the fundamental principles of database design and security remain critical.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main areas: the security implications of AI-integrated databases, the key trends and acquisitions mentioned in the article, and the author's well-known teaching style.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the security risks of MCP. Commenters agreed with Pavlo's skepticism, arguing that the protocol's philosophy of maximizing context directly opposes the security principle of least privilege. One user described it as "reinventing SQL injection," where the injection comes from the system's own hallucinations. Another commenter mentioned they are building a security gateway based on Simon Willison's "lethal trifecta" framework to mitigate these risks.

Several users discussed the market trends and acquisitions highlighted in the article. There was notable concern over Vercel's acquisition of the EdgeDB (now Gel) project, with some fearing it might be abandoned. The author, Pavlo, actively participated in the comments, correcting a user's claim that SQLite wasn't mentioned (it was, in the context of its growing use for local AI apps) and clarifying the Gel situation. Other trends debated included the move towards SQLite and DuckDB for simplicity and analytics, and the continued dominance of legacy systems like Oracle and DB2 in large enterprises.

Finally, a lighter thread emerged discussing Pavlo's "gangsta" teaching style at CMU, with users sharing links to his popular database course videos and appreciating his eccentric approach. There were also calls for more coverage on niche topics like bi-temporal databases, which some felt were a blind spot in the review.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 455 | **Comments:** 263 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica details a legal battle stemming from a murder-suicide case involving a man named Ethan. The victim's estate is suing OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT contributed to the man's deteriorating mental state and eventual death. The core of the lawsuit is OpenAI's refusal to release the chat logs associated with the deceased user's account. The company is citing privacy policies that they claim prevent them from sharing such data, even with the user's estate. This has created a legal standoff over digital privacy, corporate responsibility, and the rights of a deceased individual's family to understand the circumstances surrounding their loved one's death.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, with commenters exploring several distinct themes. A primary point of debate is the nature of AI itself and its potential for harm. Many users expressed concern about the "sycophantic" behavior of large language models, which can validate and amplify a user's delusional thoughts rather than challenging them. This led to a broader philosophical debate on the safety of future, more powerful AI systems, with a common sentiment being that if current "simple" chatbots are already proving difficult to make safe, the prospect of "superintelligence" is deeply concerning.

Another major theme was the legal and ethical conflict between user privacy and the need for evidence. Commenters were divided; some argued that a company's duty to protect user data should extend even after death, while others found it "bonkers" that OpenAI could withhold potentially crucial evidence from a legal investigation. This sparked discussions about the legal concept of discovery and whether a company's privacy policies should supersede a court's request for information in a serious criminal case.

Finally, some commenters attempted to contextualize the event, suggesting that other factors, such as the deceased's reported use of performance-enhancing drugs, might have been more significant contributors to his mental state than his interactions with AI. There was also a recurring comparison of OpenAI's actions to Orwellian themes, with users drawing parallels between the company's name and its "closed data" policies.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 415 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The post alleges that RevisionDojo, a Y Combinator (YC) startup, is running astroturfing campaigns. The post itself contains no text, but the title claims the startup is targeting children with these deceptive marketing practices. The link presumably leads to evidence of these campaigns.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of cynicism, outrage, and calls to action. The dominant sentiment is that unethical behavior is common among YC startups, with many commenters expressing sarcasm ("shocking") rather than genuine surprise. The discussion quickly broadened from the specific allegation against RevisionDojo to a wider critique of YC's "fake it till you make it" culture, which some argue encourages or enables fraud.

Key discussion points included:
*   **Calls for Reporting:** Several users provided links to report the alleged fraud to the FTC, state Attorneys General, and the news outlet 404 Media.
*   **Broader Pattern of YC Startups:** Users cited other YC-backed companies they believe are acting unethically, such as Pickle (for allegedly misleading customers about its AR device) and Honey (for undisclosed practices). This reinforced the narrative that the issue is systemic to YC's portfolio.
*   **Prevalence of Astroturfing:** Commenters noted that astroturfing and using sockpuppet accounts are rampant on social media, including Reddit and even Hacker News. Some pointed out that this practice is a known business model and even part of Reddit's own history.
*   **The Ethics of Test Prep:** A sub-thread emerged about the nature of the test prep industry, with one user claiming that the vast majority of demand from students is for cheating tools, not legitimate study aids.

## [Google broke my heart](https://perishablepress.com/google-broke-my-heart/)
**Score:** 370 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46505518

> **Article:** The article "Google broke my heart" by Jeff Starr details his frustrating experience with Google's DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) process. Starr, an author and web developer, found that his legitimate website content was being plagiarized and republished by other sites. When he attempted to file DMCA takedown requests through Google's official channels to have the infringing links removed from search results, his requests were repeatedly rejected.

The core of his complaint is the lack of a clear, functional process for him to prove his ownership. He expresses deep frustration and a sense of betrayal, feeling that the system is designed to ignore or disqualify legitimate creators while favoring large corporations. He argues that the process is opaque, unresponsive, and offers no viable path for a small independent author to protect his own work from theft.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a multifaceted analysis of the author's problem, with commenters exploring legal, corporate, and procedural angles. A central theme is the inherent difficulty of designing a content moderation system that balances protection for creators with protection against fraudulent takedown requests. Many see this as a classic "false negative" problem, where Google's recent efforts to curb illegitimate claims (a response to widespread abuse of the DMCA system) have inadvertently made it harder for legitimate owners like Starr to succeed.

Several practical, though often pessimistic, solutions were proposed. The most common advice was to "hire a lawyer," with commenters arguing that only legal professionals know how to navigate the opaque corporate channels of a company like Google. Others suggested that the author's failure to register his copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office was a major misstep, as registration creates the clear, formal evidence needed for such disputes. The idea of using PGP signatures was floated but quickly dismissed as impractical, as an infringer could simply strip the signature.

Commenters also debated the root cause. Some blamed the replacement of human support with automated systems and low-skilled agents, while others argued that Google's core business model is simply not aligned with helping individual creators. A recurring point was the author's own potential contribution to the problem: his legal copyright holder is listed as "Perishable Press," not his personal name "Jeff Starr," which could easily confuse an automated or under-trained review process. Ultimately, the consensus was that the author must stop treating Google as a "friend" and start treating it as a bureaucratic machine, which means providing the exact, formal documentation it requires, likely with the help of legal counsel.

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 314 | **Comments:** 283 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article is a personal blog post detailing the author's experience switching from VS Code to the Zed code editor. The author highlights several key advantages of Zed, primarily its superior performance and speed, which they attribute to its Rust-based architecture and GPU acceleration. They praise the user interface for being clean, modern, and intuitive. The post also covers the ease of migrating settings from VS Code and the overall smoothness of the editing experience. While acknowledging that Zed is still a relatively new editor, the author concludes that for their workflow, the benefits in performance and user experience make it a worthwhile and successful switch.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the switch to Zed is multifaceted, with users weighing the editor's modern appeal against practical adoption hurdles. A central theme is the tension between individual preference and organizational or ecosystem lock-in. While some argue that organizations are simply collections of individuals and should be flexible, others point to the entrenched nature of toolchains, especially in embedded systems where chip manufacturers have standardized on VS Code, making a switch difficult for professionals in that field.

On the technical side, the conversation reveals a mix of praise and persistent pain points. Performance and UI design are frequently lauded, with one user calling it a "modern Sublime Text." However, several specific issues are repeatedly cited as blockers for adoption. These include poor low-DPI font rendering, which many find surprising in a modern editor; incomplete or buggy keybindings for users of alternative workflows like Emacs; and the lack of features like vertical tabs, which has led some users to maintain their own patched versions.

There is also a notable discussion around the editor's development priorities. While some users appreciate the advanced AI features, others express a desire for the team to focus on polishing fundamental editor features and parity with existing standards (like LSP Semantic Highlighting) before expanding into new areas. Finally, some users share their successful migration paths from other editors like Sublime Text and WebStorm, indicating Zed is gaining traction beyond just the VS Code user base.

## [Microsoft Office renamed to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app”](https://www.office.com)
**Score:** 305 | **Comments:** 244 | **ID:** 46496465

> **Article:** The article (and the linked office.com URL) announces that Microsoft has renamed its mobile application from "Microsoft Office" to the "Microsoft 365 Copilot app." The page explicitly states the app is "formerly Office," signaling a strategic shift to center the brand around its AI features rather than the traditional productivity suite name.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with near-universal derision and skepticism toward the rebrand. Commenters widely viewed the move as "bizarre," "desperate," and "confusing," ranking it alongside Twitter's rebrand to X as one of the worst in recent history.

The discussion focused on three main themes:
*   **Brand Dilution:** Users argued that "Office" is a far more valuable and recognizable brand than "Copilot," and that burying the former under the latter makes the product harder to identify.
*   **Corporate Motivations:** Skeptics suggested the rename is a cynical accounting trick to artificially inflate Copilot adoption statistics by forcing existing Office users to use the rebranded app. Others viewed it as a desperate attempt by Microsoft to appear relevant in the AI hype cycle, even if it alienates consumers.
*   **General Incompetence:** The rename was cited as another example of Microsoft's poor naming conventions and lack of care for user experience, with many users expressing frustration that the "Copilot" branding is being aggressively forced across the ecosystem.

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – Log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 304 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project, "DoNotNotify," is an Android application designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log notifications and create intelligent, rule-based filters to automatically block or dismiss them. The primary goal is to combat "notification spam"—specifically, marketing and promotional messages that apps push through notification channels, even when users only want to receive essential, functional alerts (e.g., a ride status update but not an ad for a new partnership). The app aims to solve the problem of having to keep notifications enabled for critical apps that also abuse the privilege with unwanted content.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 294 | **Comments:** 303 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that the proliferation of AI-generated video is a net negative for society. The author contends that these videos are not a form of creative expression but rather a "harmful byproduct" of the race to develop AGI. The primary harms identified are: the massive, uncredited ingestion of human-created content to train the models; the creation of a "flood of slop" that pollutes the information ecosystem with misinformation and low-quality content; and the "uncanny valley" effect, a subtle but visceral wrongness that the author finds repulsive. The piece frames AI video generation as a tool for propaganda, fraud, and the erosion of trust, rather than a genuine enabler of creativity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and multifaceted debate over the value and impact of AI-generated video. While many commenters share the article's skepticism, the conversation explores several nuances and counterarguments.

A central theme is the debate over what constitutes "creativity" and "art." One side argues that AI tools, by automating visual style, editing, and even the creative process itself, are not enabling human creativity but rather removing it, leading to a flood of generic, soulless content. This view is bolstered by personal experiences of revulsion towards the "AI tone" and the uncanny valley effect, which some see as an evolutionarily adaptive defense mechanism against inauthenticity. However, others counter that all new creative mediums (like 3D animation vs. hand-drawn) were initially met with skepticism. They argue that the value lies in the human's vision, scripting, and curation, and that AI can be a powerful tool for those who learn to direct it and lean into its unique aesthetic.

Beyond the artistic debate, there is a strong consensus on the societal harms. Commenters point to the "race to the bottom" in advertising, the erosion of trust due to rampant fraud and misinformation, and the unprecedented scale at which AI can generate "slop," overwhelming our ability to filter truth from fiction. The discussion also touches on the underlying motivations, suggesting that the goal for some at the forefront is not creative expression but achieving AGI to gain immense power, with the negative externalities being an accepted cost.

Finally, the conversation explores potential responses. Some advocate for a pragmatic disengagement from the internet, while others recognize that this is a systemic problem that cannot be solved on an individual level, especially as AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from human-made work and influences real-world events like elections. The overall sentiment is one of deep concern, with a clear division between those who see AI video as an inevitable and potentially useful new medium and those who see it as an inherently destructive force.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 280 | **Comments:** 508 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An article on Ars Technica reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming its users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok. The company's official safety statement warned that users prompting Grok to create illegal content would face the same consequences as those who upload it. However, the article highlights that X has not announced any technical fixes to prevent the AI from generating such material in the first place. The piece also notes that Grok is being used to generate non-consensual sexual images of public figures and everyday users, and questions whether the platform can legally claim liability protection (like Section 230) for content created by its own AI agent.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of X's position, with commenters expressing a mix of outrage, cynicism, and legal analysis. The dominant sentiment is that X is shirking its responsibility by blaming users for a problem inherent to its own product. Many see this as a predictable outcome of the platform's current management and culture, with several users noting they have left the platform due to the proliferation of hate speech and now AI-generated sexual content.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the legal implications. Commenters speculate that Section 230 liability shields, which typically protect platforms from user-generated content, should not apply here since Grok is an agent of X itself. There is a strong belief that this constitutes a failure to implement basic safeguards and could open the company to civil and even criminal liability, though many doubt any real consequences will follow due to the company's power.

The conversation also broadens to connect this issue with wider political and cultural trends. Some users suggest that payment processors could be a potential lever to pressure the platform. Others frame the situation as part of a larger "culture war," arguing that a pro-pedophilia sentiment has become tacitly accepted in some political circles, which provides cover for X's inaction and prevents regulatory bodies like app stores from taking a harder line.

## [A spider web unlike any seen before](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/science/biggest-spiderweb-sulfur-cave.html)
**Score:** 279 | **Comments:** 136 | **ID:** 46496054

> **Article:** The New York Times article reports the discovery of the world's largest spider web, located inside a remote, pitch-black cave in Brazil. The web spans a massive area and is inhabited by an estimated 111,000 spiders of a single species. This species, a type of social spider, defies the typical solitary nature of spiders by co-existing and cooperating in a massive colony. The cave's unique, toxic environment (filled with hydrogen sulfide gas) protects the spiders from most predators. Their immense population is sustained by a massive food source within the cave: over 2.4 million midges that also live there, which the spiders trap in their colossal web.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was a mix of fascination, humor, and scientific inquiry. Initial reactions ranged from a simple "Nope!" to users noting the irony of expecting a story about web crawlers. The primary question raised was how such a large population could be sustained, which was quickly answered by other users pointing to the article's mention of a huge midge population inside the cave.

The conversation then delved into the spiders' unusual social behavior. Users were surprised by the colony, but were corrected that hundreds of spider species are actually social, with one commenter recommending the sci-fi book "Children of Time" as a relevant read. There was also a humorous thread about the spiders creating a "safe space" away from humanity.

A minor debate arose regarding the safety of the researchers in the video, who were not wearing masks in a cave with high concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas. One user criticized this, but another pointed out that the article text clarified the researchers were indeed wearing masks and had simply grown accustomed to the smell. Finally, a technical discussion emerged about the limitations of the archive.today service, which failed to properly archive the article's embedded video.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 472 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang argues that the US has "done our country a great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and now risks repeating the mistake with AI infrastructure. He advocates for "forcing" companies to build AI data centers and advanced manufacturing facilities within the United States through a combination of tariffs, laws, and subsidies. His stated goal is to create broad prosperity for all Americans, not just highly educated elites, by bringing critical jobs and industries back to domestic soil.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely skeptical of Jensen Huang's motives and the feasibility of his proposals. A recurring theme is the suspicion that his comments are self-serving, aimed at securing government subsidies or favorable regulations ("Kiss the ring") to keep NVIDIA's stock price rising. Many commenters argue that the core issue isn't a lack of wealth, but its extreme concentration in the hands of a few, including billionaires like Huang himself.

There is also significant debate over the practicalities of reshoring. While some point out that data centers do create jobs and infrastructure, others remain cynical about their impact on wealth inequality. The conversation frequently circles back to the decades-old debate about free trade, with Huang's stance being compared to Ross Perot's famous "giant sucking sound" warning from the 1992 US presidential election. Ultimately, the discussion portrays Huang's statement as a politically convenient sentiment that ignores the fundamental problem of wealth distribution.

## [Brave overhauled its Rust adblock engine with FlatBuffers, cutting memory 75%](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/36-adblock-memory-reduction/)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46501894

> **Article:** Brave published an article detailing a major overhaul of its adblock engine, which is written in Rust. The primary change was replacing JSON-based filter list parsing with FlatBuffers, a serialization library. This optimization resulted in a 75% reduction in memory usage for the adblocker. For a default adblock setup, this translates to a saving of approximately 45 MiB of RAM. The engine also leverages open-source Rust crates from the Servo project (used by Firefox) for CSS parsing and selector evaluation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion around Brave's adblock engine update covered several distinct themes:

**Impact of the Memory Savings:**
There was a debate on whether saving 45 MiB is significant. Some commenters initially dismissed it as negligible in an era of large RAM capacities and bloated applications like Electron. However, others countered that this is a per-process saving, and with modern browsers using a process per tab, the cumulative savings across many tabs can be substantial. The improvement was praised as a welcome sign of developers prioritizing efficiency.

**Technical Implementation and the Rust Ecosystem:**
The use of Rust and its ecosystem was a central topic. One commenter highlighted the positive aspect of open-source collaboration, noting that Brave's engine is a crate that can be shared and reused. This sparked a counterpoint about the Rust ecosystem's tendency towards static linking, which prevents runtime library sharing and can lead to code duplication in memory. Another user questioned the security implications of relying on a public crate repository (crates.io), drawing a parallel to the supply-chain attacks seen in the Node.js/npm ecosystem.

**Browser Switching and Feature Comparisons:**
The article prompted a discussion about browser choice, particularly between Brave and Firefox. A user mentioned considering a switch to Brave after learning it supports vertical tabs, which led to a rebuttal from Firefox users pointing out that Firefox has had robust vertical tab extensions for years and recently added native support.

**Brave's Business Model and Reputation:**
Several comments addressed common criticisms of Brave's model. One user asked if Brave still replaces ads with its own cryptocurrency ads. Multiple responses clarified that Brave's own ads are strictly opt-in and that the browser's primary function is blocking third-party ads by default. Another user brought up Brave's past controversy of inserting affiliate links into URLs, which the company has since discontinued. A separate, more pointed question asked if Brave was a "pump-and-dump scheme," which was flatly denied. The discussion also touched on the desire for a "de-bloated" version of Brave for Linux distros, with a mention that the company is considering a "Brave-origin" build.

**Mobile Experience:**
A user noted that the lack of extensions on Brave for Android prevents them from switching from Firefox. Another user countered that Brave's built-in adblocking and forced dark mode features were sufficient for their needs, and that extension support is reportedly in development.

## [Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale](https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch)
**Score:** 228 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46501137

> **Project:** Tailsnitch is a security auditing tool for Tailscale networks, presented as a "Show HN" project. It acts as a configuration linter that scans a Tailscale tailnet's Access Control Lists (ACLs) and other settings to identify potential security misconfigurations. The tool is intended to help administrators manage security as their network grows in complexity, providing a way to validate that the "HuJSON" ACL file doesn't contain dangerous or overly permissive rules. The project is open-source and available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to the project, validating the need for such a tool. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Addressing a Real Pain Point:** Multiple users expressed anxiety about managing complex ACLs as their Tailscale networks grow. One commenter noted their ACL file had become "terrifyingly long," and the tool's ability to run in CI/CD was a major benefit for preventing misconfigurations.
*   **Calls for Native Integration:** There was a strong sentiment that Tailscale should offer this functionality natively. Users suggested a "scan now" button in the GUI and, more importantly, an API to expose audit data for automated compliance and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) systems.
*   **Security and Trust Concerns:** A commenter humorously but critically pointed out the irony of a security tool requiring users to run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine` on macOS, which disables security protections. The general advice was to run such tools in a sandboxed VM to avoid adding risk.
*   **Scope and Feature Requests:** The discussion also explored the tool's scope. It was clarified that it's a configuration linter, not a live activity monitor. This led to a feature request for live audit logs for SSH connections to common "admin" accounts, with another user suggesting Teleport as a tool that already does this well.
*   **Broader Security Context:** The tool was seen as a step towards "continuous compliance" and making SOC2 audits easier. There was also a question about its compatibility with Headscale (the open-source Tailscale control server), to which the author had not yet responded.

## [Sega co-founder David Rosen has died](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 32 | **ID:** 46502239

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports the death of David Rosen, the American co-founder of the iconic Japanese video game company Sega. The article highlights Rosen's unique history: he founded Service Games (which later became Sega) in 1950s Japan after serving in the US Air Force. It details his entrepreneurial journey from operating coin-operated photo booths to importing and eventually manufacturing arcade machines, laying the foundation for a global gaming giant.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by a collective "TIL" (Today I Learned) reaction, with many users expressing surprise that Sega was founded by an American GI rather than a Japanese company. This sparked a conversation about the company's "strange history," noting the irony that a company with American roots later became known for its rigid hierarchy and for treating its American and European offices as subordinate.

Beyond the historical revelations, there is significant nostalgia and praise for Sega's legacy. Users laud their "stellar" arcade output, elite game development teams, and top-notch hardware. A key point of comparison is Sega's modern relationship with its fanbase. Several commenters praise Sega for being more amenable to fan projects and emulation compared to competitors like Nintendo, citing examples like hiring hackers to create *Sonic Mania* and officially releasing their classic games on Steam using standard ROMs.

Finally, the discussion touches on the history of the history itself. One commenter recommends the book *Console Wars*, but a reply notes that David Rosen himself later disputed the book's narrative of internal conflict, claiming the author misunderstood the business dynamics. The thread also includes minor meta-commentary on the HN submission process.

## [Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/)
**Score:** 187 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46505975

> **Article:** Donut Lab has announced a new all-solid-state battery with a claimed energy density of 400 Wh/kg. The announcement is tied to Verge Motorcycles, which is reportedly using this battery in its electric motorcycles. The battery is said to offer a 370-mile range and can be charged to 80% in 10 minutes. The announcement also includes a "drag & drop" software platform for building EVs, positioning Donut as a technology provider for the industry.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by deep skepticism, with many commenters labeling the announcement as "vaporware" or a potential "rug pull." The primary points of contention are the lack of established partnerships, no mention of manufacturing capabilities, and the general rarity of commercially viable solid-state batteries. Users point out that while the technology is theoretically possible, it has been notoriously expensive and difficult to scale.

However, some evidence suggests the project may be more than just hype. Commenters discovered that Donut Lab is a subsidiary of Verge Motorcycles, a real company with physical stores in California where one can supposedly see the motorcycle in person. This lends a degree of credibility, though it's noted that the bikes are only available for pre-order.

Other points of discussion include:
*   **Inconsistent Claims:** A user highlights a discrepancy between Donut Lab's claim of a 5-minute full charge and a Verge video claiming a 50% charge in 10 minutes.
*   **Technology Speculation:** There is speculation about the battery's underlying chemistry, with suggestions it could be sodium-based or derived from a partner company called Nordic Nano.
*   **Overall Sentiment:** While the community is hopeful for a breakthrough in battery technology, the prevailing attitude is "prove it," with a strong demand for independent verification and concrete manufacturing plans.

## [Decorative Cryptography](https://www.dlp.rip/decorative-cryptography)
**Score:** 160 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46496494

> **Article:** The article "Decorative Cryptography" argues that much of the security in modern systems is "decorative"—it looks like security but fails under scrutiny because it doesn't account for a realistic threat model. The author critiques common practices where security features are implemented but are easily bypassed by a capable adversary. Key examples include:

*   **Misplaced Trust:** Relying on software obfuscation or user-space anti-tampering, which is futile once an attacker has control of the OS or kernel.
*   **Hardware Vulnerabilities:** The need for an integrated root-of-trust (like a TPM inside the CPU) to defend against physical attacks like interposers that sit on the bus between components.
*   **Vague Security Claims:** Features that are unexplainable or not transparent are likely marketing rather than genuine security.

The central thesis is that security must be designed with a clear and honest threat model, acknowledging that if an attacker can control the hardware or OS, software-only protections are largely decorative.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the difficulty of achieving real security against a determined adversary. The conversation highlights several key themes:

*   **The Futility of Software-Only Protection:** Multiple users shared anecdotes of bypassing complex anti-tampering and obfuscation schemes. One user detailed a week-long effort to patch a kernel and defeat memory checksums just to disable SSL pinning, concluding that such measures are a battle of attrition rather than a true defense. The consensus is that if the attacker controls the OS, the game is lost.

*   **Hardware as the Root of Trust:** There was a significant debate about hardware security. Users noted that IBM's POWER9 CPUs had features to prevent physical bus attacks, a practice not widely adopted by Intel or AMD. The discussion centered on the necessity of an integrated root-of-trust (like an on-die TPM) to secure the boot process and protect secrets from physical interposers. However, a counterpoint was raised that this still requires trusting the CPU vendor themselves.

*   **Real-World Nuances and "Decorative" Features:** The conversation extended to real-world examples of "decorative" security. One user brought up Apple iMessage's E2E encryption, questioning its integrity given on-device content scanning capabilities, though others pointed out that specific claim may have been debunked. Another user offered the memorable quote, "All encryption is end-to-end, if you’re not picky about the ends."

*   **Theoretical vs. Practical Security:** A distinction was made between theoretical security (like bug-free software implementations) and practical security. While a one-time pad is theoretically unbreakable, all other software encryption is a matter of making the cost of breaking it higher than the value of the information. The discussion concluded that without hardware-level security, software protections are ultimately a delaying tactic.

## [CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it (2022)](https://idiallo.com/blog/learn-css)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 206 | **ID:** 46500022

> **Article:** The article "CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it" argues that developers' frustration with CSS stems from a lack of fundamental knowledge rather than inherent flaws in the language itself. The author posits that many developers treat CSS as an afterthought, relying on frameworks and "hacks" without understanding core concepts like the box model, specificity, or layout systems. This superficial approach leads to convoluted, unmaintainable code and the perception that CSS is broken. The piece suggests that investing time to learn CSS properly—its paradigms, rules, and modern features like Grid and Flexbox—would empower developers to build more robust, efficient, and elegant user interfaces, ultimately making their work easier and more enjoyable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, revealing a deep divide between those who see CSS as a learnable, powerful tool and those who view it as fundamentally flawed. The consensus is that while the "CSS sucks" sentiment is common, the root causes are multifaceted.

A primary theme is that CSS's complexity and constant evolution make it difficult to master. Commenters note that it's a moving target, requiring developers to continuously learn new layout models and features, which is burdensome for those not specializing in front-end. This is compounded by a perceived lack of strong conventions and best practices, leading to inconsistent implementations.

The discussion heavily critiques modern CSS as a "declarative language with terrible ergonomics." Critics point to its global scope, lack of composability, and historical "hacks" (like percentage padding for aspect ratios) as evidence of its flawed design. This is contrasted with the rise of utility-first frameworks like Tailwind, which many see not as a solution but a "symptom" of CSS's poor developer experience. Tailwind is praised for solving issues like global namespace collisions and providing a more predictable, composable system, though others argue it's a workaround for developers who never learned vanilla CSS.

However, several commenters defend modern CSS, particularly Grid and Flexbox, arguing they are powerful and, once learned, offer superior ergonomics and accessibility compared to older methods or simplified abstractions. They push back against the "it changes" argument, stating that foundational concepts remain stable and new features are additive, not replacements.

Finally, the conversation touches on the philosophical divide between backend and frontend developers. The Linus Torvalds quote about being unable to create a pretty UI is used to illustrate that some programmers simply lack the design inclination, making CSS a frustrating hurdle. The counterpoint is that developers aren't expected to be designers but to accurately implement designs, and that practical application is the best way to learn any skill, including CSS.
