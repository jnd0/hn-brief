# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-06

## [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Score:** 2289 | **Comments:** 888 | **ID:** 46497712

> **Article:** The article "It's hard to justify Tahoe icons" by Anton Troynikov argues that Apple's recent user interface design choices, specifically in macOS Tahoe, represent a regression in usability. The author contends that the new icons are inconsistent, poorly aligned, and lack the clear visual hierarchy of older, more functional designs. He demonstrates this by comparing the new icons to older system icons and those from competitors, pointing out issues like misaligned text, inconsistent use of color, and the removal of useful visual cues. The core argument is that this trend prioritizes aesthetic minimalism over practical function, making the UI less efficient for users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by a central irony: many commenters point out that the article, which criticizes distracting and unnecessary UI elements, is itself hosted on a website with a full-screen animated snow effect. This sparked a debate about the context of design. One side argued that a personal blog is an appropriate place for playful, optional flair, whereas a major operating system for millions of users has a much higher responsibility for clarity and usability. The author's snow effect can be disabled, but the UI choices in macOS cannot.

Beyond the irony, commenters largely agreed with the article's core premise, expressing broad frustration with modern UI trends. A common sentiment was that user interface design peaked in the late 1990s or early 2000s with systems like Windows 2000/XP and Mac OS X Tiger/Leopard, which were seen as highly functional and clear. The discussion also branched into speculation about the corporate incentives behind these design changes, with some suggesting that constant UI refreshes serve internal company metrics (KPIs) and career advancement rather than user benefit. Others suggested that as computers became a necessity, the pressure to maintain high usability has lessened, leading to "enshittification." A few commenters also suggested alternatives like the KDE desktop environment, which they feel handles these UI details better.

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 690 | **Comments:** 323 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article from Low Orbit Security presents a technical analysis of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomalies that occurred on May 3, 2019, preceding and coinciding with a massive, nationwide blackout in Venezuela. The author, "Radar," observes that on that date, internet traffic destined for Venezuelan IP addresses was briefly and unnaturally re-routed through networks in Italy (Telecom Italia Sparkle) and Brazil (GlobeNet). This rerouting happened just hours before the power grid failure. The article posits that this was not a coincidence but rather a sophisticated cyber-attack, possibly a "man-in-the-middle" or traffic interception operation, designed to disrupt communications and gather intelligence as a precursor to the physical grid takedown. The piece frames the event as a case study in modern hybrid warfare, where digital infrastructure manipulation precedes or accompanies kinetic effects.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around the technical implications of the BGP anomalies, the geopolitical context of the 2019 Venezuela crisis, and the broader nature of modern cyber warfare. While some users debated the technical details—questioning whether the BGP changes were the cause or a symptom of the blackout, or what specific benefit they would provide (e.g., spying vs. packet dropping)—the consensus leaned towards accepting the event as a deliberate, sophisticated operation.

The conversation quickly expanded beyond Venezuela. Several commenters drew parallels to current geopolitical tensions, particularly President Trump's threats to purchase Greenland, suggesting similar digital tactics could be used to destabilize other nations. This led to a broader debate on the vulnerability of global internet infrastructure (with BGP's inherent insecurity being a key point) and the geopolitical risks of technological dependence. The discussion concluded that while such capabilities are terrifying, they are a standard part of major powers' military planning, and that nuclear deterrence may not be a reliable shield against this new form of asymmetric cyber conflict.

## [Anna's Archive loses .org domain after surprise suspension](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/)
**Score:** 629 | **Comments:** 319 | **ID:** 46497164

> **Article:** The article from TorrentFreak reports that Anna's Archive, a major search engine for pirated books and academic papers, has lost its primary `annas-archive.org` domain. The domain was suspended by the Public Interest Registry (PIR) due to a "ServerHold" status, which effectively removes the domain from the internet's DNS system. The suspension appears to be the result of legal pressure from major music labels and other rights holders, coordinated by the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE). The organization behind Anna's Archive, which presents itself as a digital preservation project, has advised its users to find its current working domains through its Wikipedia page, a tactic that highlights the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between such sites and enforcement agencies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the predictable nature of the domain seizure, strategies for circumventing censorship, and the broader implications of the conflict between digital archiving and copyright enforcement. There is a strong undercurrent of sympathy for Anna's Archive, with many commenters viewing it as a vital preservation effort rather than a simple piracy hub. The domain takedown is seen by some as a Streisand effect, inadvertently boosting the site's visibility and attracting new users.

Several key themes emerged from the conversation:

*   **Decentralization and Resilience:** A major focus was on methods to make such projects immune to domain-level takedowns. Commenters suggested using decentralized technologies like the Yggdrasil network, Nostr for communication, and torrents for content distribution. The idea of seeding Anna's Archive's torrents was strongly encouraged as a way to "donate" to cultural preservation and ensure content remains accessible even if the central site is gone.
*   **The "Wikipedia as DNS" Problem:** The practice of using a Wikipedia page as a reliable source for current domain names was debated. While some saw it as a clever workaround, others expressed concern that it could expose Wikipedia to legal pressure and liability, effectively turning it into a de facto DNS for controversial sites.
*   **Legal and Technical Nuances:** The discussion touched on the technical details of the `serverHold` status, with commenters confirming it's a common tool used by registries in response to legal orders. There was also debate about the viability of simply registering a new domain, with the consensus being that it's not a simple fix due to the need for new HTTPS certificates and the high likelihood of swift re-seizure.
*   **Nostr Controversy:** A side-thread debated the merits of Nostr as a censorship-resistant platform. While one user championed it, another pointed to its Wikipedia page, which mentioned the founder's past association with far-right figures and the protocol's potential for spam, sparking a meta-discussion about potential smears and the challenges of building decentralized systems.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 461 | **Comments:** 266 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica details a legal battle surrounding a murder-suicide case involving a user of ChatGPT. The victim's estate is suing OpenAI, alleging that the AI played a role in the user's descent into delusion and eventual violence. The central conflict highlighted in the article is OpenAI's refusal to provide the complete chat logs from the user's account to the plaintiffs. The company is citing user privacy policies, even post-mortem, creating a legal and ethical standoff over data access in the context of a criminal investigation and wrongful death lawsuit. The case raises questions about the safety of AI chatbots and the company's responsibility for user interactions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, with commenters expressing skepticism, concern, and legal analysis. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the nature of AI itself. Several users suggest that the AI's behavior was likely a result of "sycophantic" tendencies, where the model amplifies user input rather than initiating harmful ideas. This is contrasted with a more existential fear that if current chatbots are already "unsafe" and difficult to control, the prospect of future "superintelligence" is deeply concerning.

Another major theme is the legal and ethical dilemma of data privacy versus investigative necessity. While some users argue that a company's duty to protect user privacy should extend beyond death, others point out that in a legal context, such data would typically be subject to discovery. The refusal by OpenAI is seen by some as "Orwellian," while others acknowledge the complex legal process at play.

Finally, commenters also discussed the specifics of the case, with some suggesting that external factors, such as the victim's use of performance-enhancing drugs, might have been a more significant contributor to his mental state than his AI interactions. Overall, the discussion reflects a mixture of skepticism towards the "AI as villain" narrative, genuine alarm about the technology's potential for harm, and debate over corporate responsibility and legal obligations.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 421 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The article (likely from a source like 404 Media) accuses RevisionDojo, a Y Combinator-backed startup, of engaging in "astroturfing" campaigns. This involves creating fake grassroots support for their product, which appears to be an AI-powered study and test-prep tool. The accusation is that the company is using deceptive marketing tactics, specifically targeting minors, to promote their services.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with cynicism and anger, primarily focusing on the behavior of Y Combinator (YC) and the prevalence of such unethical practices in the tech industry.

The discussion can be broken down into three main themes:

*   **Cynicism Towards Y Combinator:** Many commenters expressed that unethical behavior from a YC startup was unsurprising. The conversation quickly broadened from RevisionDojo to include other YC-backed companies accused of shady practices, such as Pickle (for misleading customers about its AR device) and Honey (for undisclosed business practices). This fueled a narrative that YC's "growth at all costs" and "fake it till you make it" culture encourages or overlooks fraudulent behavior.

*   **The Pervasiveness of Astroturfing:** Several users noted that astroturfing and the use of "sockpuppet" accounts are rampant across the internet, especially on platforms like Reddit. Some pointed out the ironic history that Reddit's own founders used fake accounts to make the site appear popular in its early days. There was a general consensus that this is a widespread problem that social media platforms do not adequately address.

*   **The Ethics of the EdTech Market:** A sub-thread focused on the nature of the test-prep industry itself. One user, who had considered starting a company in the space, claimed that the "vast majority" of demand from students is for cheating tools. This led to a debate about whether "cheat sheets" are inherently bad, with one user arguing that creating them is a valid study method that requires understanding the material.

Overall, the sentiment was highly critical, with commenters calling for regulatory action (reporting to the FTC/Attorney General) and expressing deep distrust in both the specific startup and the broader YC ecosystem.

## [Google broke my heart](https://perishablepress.com/google-broke-my-heart/)
**Score:** 404 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46505518

> **Article:** The article, titled "Google broke my heart," details author Jeff Starr's frustrating and ultimately futile battle against Google to remove a pirated copy of his book, "Digging into WordPress." Starr discovered that a website was offering a free, unauthorized download of his book. He filed a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown request with Google, which is the standard procedure for getting infringing content de-indexed from search results.

However, Google repeatedly rejected his requests. The core of the problem was that Google's automated system and support staff demanded proof of ownership that Starr could not provide to their satisfaction. Despite being the author, he was caught in a bureaucratic loop where he couldn't prove he was the copyright holder. The article portrays a deeply personal and disheartening experience, highlighting the powerlessness of a small creator against a massive corporation's opaque and seemingly automated processes. It serves as a cautionary tale about the difficulties of enforcing intellectual property rights in the digital age, even for the original creator.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article centered on the systemic failures of handling copyright claims at scale and offered a mix of sympathy for the author, criticism of Google's processes, and practical (though often pessimistic) advice.

A primary theme was the inadequacy of Google's support and verification systems. Many commenters expressed frustration, sharing similar anecdotes or pointing out that Google's process lacks transparency. The key criticism was that while Google demands proof of ownership, they fail to specify what forms of proof are acceptable, creating an impossible situation for the claimant. This led to a broader debate on whether Google's actions were a deliberate cost-cutting measure, replacing human oversight with ineffective automation.

There was also a significant discussion about the nature of large corporations. Several users argued that expecting a for-profit entity like Google to act as a "friend" or "trusted ally" is naive. They advised treating the company as a bureaucratic machine and suggested that escalating to legal action is often the only effective way to get a response, as it threatens Google's legal "safe harbor" protections.

The conversation also touched on the DMCA system itself. Some commenters noted the irony that the system, which is often criticized for being easily abused by large entities to take down content, is also difficult for individual creators to use effectively. The idea that the legal system inherently favors those with more money was also raised. While some commenters offered potential solutions like PGP signatures or copyright registration, others were skeptical that these would make a difference in the face of Google's rigid, impersonal system. Ultimately, the consensus was that the author's experience was a symptom of a much larger, systemic problem.

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 332 | **Comments:** 301 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article is a personal testimonial from a developer who has switched from VS Code to the Zed editor. The author details their positive experience, highlighting Zed's speed, modern UI, and thoughtful design. They acknowledge that while some features are still maturing, the overall performance and developer experience are superior enough to warrant a full-time switch. The post serves as a recommendation for others to try Zed, particularly those who value performance and a clean, fast editing environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a balanced view of Zed, with users expressing enthusiasm for the editor while also highlighting significant barriers to adoption. The consensus is that Zed is a promising and fast editor, but its ecosystem and feature parity are not yet mature enough to unseat VS Code for many.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Ecosystem and Industry Lock-in:** A major point is the difficulty of switching at an organizational level. Several users noted that their industries, particularly embedded systems development where chip manufacturers provide toolchains built on VS Code, make switching impractical. This led to a debate on whether companies should mandate editors, with most agreeing it's a sign of a dysfunctional workflow but a reality in many large organizations.

*   **Platform and Hardware Compatibility Issues:** A recurring complaint is Zed's poor rendering on low-DPI monitors, which several users cited as a deal-breaker. Conversely, another user noted a warning about the lack of a GPU, which is an issue in their remote development setup. These comments suggest Zed is optimized for modern, high-resolution hardware, creating friction for users with different setups.

*   **Feature Parity and Missing Workflows:** Many users are waiting for specific features before they can switch. These include robust support for Emacs keybindings, vertical tabs, LSP Semantic Highlighting for custom languages, and REPLs for Lisp. The author of one such comment (gdotdesign) expressed frustration that Zed is prioritizing AI features over these fundamental editor capabilities.

*   **Positive User Experiences:** For those who have successfully switched, the feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Users praise Zed's speed, UI design, and attention to detail. Several commenters who made the switch from Sublime Text or VS Code describe the experience as a significant improvement in their daily workflow.

## [Microsoft Office renamed to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app”](https://www.office.com)
**Score:** 316 | **Comments:** 247 | **ID:** 46496465

> **Article:** The article reports that Microsoft has renamed its "Microsoft Office" mobile and desktop application to the "Microsoft 365 Copilot app." The new name is reflected on the official office.com landing page, which now greets users with "Welcome to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app" and clarifies that it is the "formerly Office" application. The change appears to be focused on the unified app experience rather than the entire Office product suite, though the branding is widely seen as confusing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with near-universal derision, characterizing the rebrand as desperate, bizarre, and one of the worst in tech history, often comparing it to Twitter's rebrand to "X." The dominant sentiment is that Microsoft is sacrificing the globally recognized and valuable "Office" brand in a clumsy attempt to signal leadership in AI.

Commenters found the new name nonsensical for a productivity suite, with sarcastic remarks suggesting the name change is a cynical ploy to artificially inflate Copilot adoption statistics by forcing Office users into the "Copilot" ecosystem. There was also some confusion regarding the scope of the change, with users noting that the branding on the website is unclear, though some clarified that the rebrand specifically targets the mobile/unified app experience rather than the desktop suite itself.

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – Log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 310 | **Comments:** 138 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project, "DoNotNotify," is an Android app designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log notifications and create intelligent, rule-based filters to automatically block or dismiss them. The primary goal is to help users eliminate spammy, promotional, or otherwise unwanted notifications from apps that they otherwise need or cannot uninstall, thereby reducing digital distraction and improving focus.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News reveals a strong, shared frustration with notification spam, particularly from major apps like Facebook, Uber, and delivery services that mix essential information with marketing messages. Users see DoNotNotify as a valuable tool to combat this, with several key themes emerging:

Many users shared their existing strategies for managing this problem. These ranged from simple solutions like permanently silencing the phone or using a "one strike and you're out" policy (immediately disabling notifications for any app that sends spam), to using paid third-party apps like BuzzKill and FilterBox, which offer similar rule-based filtering. The existence of these alternatives led some to question what unique features DoNotNotify offers.

A significant portion of the conversation was a broader critique of the notification ecosystem. Commenters argued that the onus should not be on users to manually clean up a mess created by developers. They criticized both Android and iOS for not enforcing stricter guidelines against marketing notifications and for making notification settings overly complex and difficult to navigate. There was a consensus that platforms should do more to de-platform apps that abuse notifications.

Finally, users proposed advanced features for such tools, including using local LLMs to intelligently filter notifications and the need for temporary, per-app notification silencing. The discussion also highlighted the existence of Android-specific workarounds, like using a separate user profile for work apps, as a way to achieve better separation and control.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 299 | **Comments:** 306 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that the proliferation of AI-generated video content is a net negative for society. The author, Ibrahim Diallo, contends that these videos are not harmless entertainment but are actively damaging. He identifies several key harms: they are built on the uncredited, unconsented labor of millions of human creators whose work was scraped to train the models; they contribute to a "race to the bottom" in creative industries, devaluing human skill and artistry; and they are flooding the internet with a deluge of low-quality, often misleading content that erodes trust and makes it difficult to find authentic information. Diallo also describes the distinct "uncanny valley" look of current AI video, which he finds viscerally revolting, and argues that the technology is being used to create propaganda and manipulate public opinion at an unprecedented scale. Ultimately, he sees the current state of AI video not as a tool for creative freedom, but as a mechanism for mass plagiarism and the degradation of our shared digital environment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deeply divided audience grappling with the ethical and practical implications of AI-generated video. A central point of contention is the definition of "creativity" and whether AI is a tool for expression or a replacement for it. One side argues that most AI video output is "slop," removing the craft and intentionality from the creative process and flooding platforms with low-quality, untrustworthy content. These commenters express a visceral, "gag reflex" reaction to the "AI tone" and are concerned about the erosion of truth, the potential for mass-scale psyops, and the economic "race to the bottom" that cheap AI content forces upon human creators.

On the other side, some see AI video as a democratizing force, enabling people without technical skills to bring their creative visions to life. They draw parallels to the historical adoption of CGI in animation, suggesting that the initial "uncanny valley" effect will fade as the technology improves. A recurring theme is the distinction between low-effort, automated "slop" and high-effort projects where AI is one component in a larger, human-driven creative workflow (e.g., scripting, editing, and acting). Commenters point to examples like NeuralViz as proof that AI can be used for genuinely creative and humorous ends when guided by a strong human vision. The debate also touches on practical concerns, from the resource consumption required to train and run these models to the challenge of distinguishing authentic from synthetic media, with some advocating for a radical skepticism towards all online content.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 510 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An article on Ars Technica reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok, rather than implementing technical safeguards to prevent it. The company's official statement warns that users who prompt Grok to create illegal content will face the same consequences as those who upload it. However, the article notes that X has not announced any plans to fix the underlying vulnerability in Grok that allows for the generation of such material, framing the issue as one of user misconduct rather than platform responsibility.

## [Brave overhauled its Rust adblock engine with FlatBuffers, cutting memory 75%](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/36-adblock-memory-reduction/)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46501894

> **Article:** Brave browser has significantly optimized its adblock engine by overhauling its data structures. The engine, written in Rust, replaced its previous format with FlatBuffers. This change resulted in a 75% reduction in memory usage, saving approximately 45 MiB for the default adblock configuration. The memory savings scale with the number of active block lists. The engine is open source and utilizes crates from the Servo project (also used by Firefox) for CSS parsing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the practical impact of the memory savings, the technical architecture, and broader browser comparisons.

There was a debate on the significance of saving 45 MiB. While some dismissed it as negligible given modern hardware, others argued that it is substantial, especially since memory usage scales with the number of enabled block lists and the fact that modern browsers spawn a process per tab. The conversation also touched on the efficiency of the Rust ecosystem; while the engine is open source and easily shared via crates.io, some users expressed concerns about "dependency hell" and the lack of runtime library sharing (static linking vs. dynamic linking) in Rust, which can lead to higher disk usage and missed memory sharing opportunities between processes.

Several commenters discussed Brave's business model and reputation. There were defensive responses to accusations of Brave replacing ads with crypto ads, clarifying that their "Brave Rewards" are strictly opt-in and that the browser blocks third-party ads by default. Users also noted the irony that the iOS release notes did not mention the performance update, likely because iOS browsers are required to use WebKit (Safari) under the hood, meaning the native adblocker isn't utilized in the same way.

Finally, the thread included a comparison with Firefox. While some users considered switching to Brave for native vertical tabs, others pointed out that Firefox has robust extensions (Sidebery, Tree Style Tabs) and native vertical tabs as of version 136. A recurring feature request was for Brave to support extensions on mobile, with the developer confirming it is in the works.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 477 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argued that the US has "done our country a great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and that the nation must create prosperity for all, not just highly educated "PhDs." He outlined a plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to America by using government incentives and regulations to "force" companies to build AI infrastructure within the US. The article frames this as a shift toward industrial policy and protectionism, aligning Huang with political figures who advocate for reversing the effects of free trade agreements.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely skeptical of Jensen Huang's statement, focusing on wealth distribution, hypocrisy, and the practical realities of modern manufacturing. A central theme was the critique of Huang's personal wealth; commenters argued that the problem isn't a lack of wealth in the country, but rather its extreme concentration in the hands of a few, suggesting Huang could "give back" his billions if he were truly concerned. There was significant cynicism regarding his motives, with users suggesting his call for domestic investment was a strategic move to secure government subsidies and contracts ("kiss the ring") rather than a genuine concern for the working class.

The discussion also dissected the feasibility of "reshoring" jobs. While some argued that data centers do provide jobs (albeit fewer than traditional factories), others were skeptical that high-wage US labor could compete with overseas costs without full automation. The conversation touched on the environmental impact of endless GDP growth and the historical context of offshoring, with one commenter drawing a direct parallel to Ross Perot's famous "giant sucking sound" warning from the 1992 presidential election. Ultimately, many users viewed Huang's comments as performative, noting that leaders often offer advice but rarely take concrete action that would actually reduce their own profits.

## [Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale](https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 22 | **ID:** 46501137

> **Project:** Tailsnitch is an open-source security auditing tool for Tailscale networks. It acts as a configuration linter, designed to scan a Tailscale "tailnet" for potential security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. The tool uses the Tailscale API to check Access Control Lists (ACLs) and other settings, helping administrators identify risks as their networks grow in complexity. It can be run locally or integrated into a CI/CD pipeline for automated checks. The project is available on GitHub under the organization "Adversis".
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to Tailsnitch, largely validating the need for such a tool. The discussion centered on a few key themes:

*   **Growing Pains of Tailscale:** Multiple users expressed relief at the tool's existence, citing a shared anxiety about managing complex ACL files as their tailnets grow from small personal projects to large, production-level environments. The tool directly addresses the fear of making a simple mistake in the configuration that could lead to a major security breach.

*   **Calls for Native Integration:** A prominent point was that Tailscale itself should offer this functionality natively. Users argued that a "scan now" button or an API for continuous compliance monitoring would be a valuable feature for enterprise customers and align with Tailscale's brand. This would help with automated GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) evidence collection for frameworks like SOC2.

*   **Security and Trust Concerns:** A practical critique was raised about the security of running a third-party binary on core infrastructure. One commenter humorously pointed out the irony of being told to disable macOS security features (`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine`) to run a security tool, suggesting it should be run in a sandboxed VM to avoid adding risk.

*   **Scope and Feature Requests:** The conversation also explored the tool's scope. Users asked if it would support Headscale (the open-source Tailscale control server) and requested features like "custom checks" for user-defined rules. A separate, distinct feature request emerged for a different kind of tool: one that provides live audit logs for SSH sessions (e.g., who logged into an admin account), a need currently not fully met by Tailscale's native audit logging.

## [Sega co-founder David Rosen has died](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies)
**Score:** 228 | **Comments:** 32 | **ID:** 46502239

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports the death of David Rosen, the American co-founder of the iconic video game company Sega. The article details Rosen's history, starting from his time as a GI in Japan where he founded a photo booth business, which eventually evolved into Service Games (Sega). It highlights his pivotal role in establishing one of Japan's most famous entertainment companies, challenging the common assumption that Sega was founded by Japanese engineers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of historical surprise, nostalgia, and meta-commentary on the submission process.

Many users expressed shock at learning the company's origins, noting that Sega was founded by an American GI rather than Japanese engineers. This led to discussions about the "strange history" of the company, specifically the tension between Sega of Japan and its subordinate American and European offices, despite the American founder.

There was significant nostalgia for Sega's legacy. Users praised the company's "stellar" arcade output and hardware, and fondly recalled their early attempts at PC emulation (like the "Sega Smash Pack"). A notable point of discussion was Sega's modern approach to fan projects and emulation, which was favorably compared to Nintendo's litigiousness; users highlighted how Sega hired hackers for official projects (like *Sonic Mania*) and generally allows fan works to exist.

Finally, the discussion included a recommendation for the book *Console Wars*, but this was immediately followed by a counterpoint citing David Rosen's own disapproval of the book's narrative, claiming it misrepresented internal conflicts. The thread concluded with a brief, meta-discussion about the inconsistency of the HN submission system, as users noted that this news had been submitted and ignored multiple times before finally hitting the front page.

## [Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46505975

> **Article:** Donut Lab has announced an all-solid-state battery with an energy density of 400 Wh/kg. The announcement is linked to the launch of new electric motorcycles from its parent company, Verge Motorcycles. The company claims the battery technology enables a motorcycle with a 370-mile range and the ability to add 186 miles of range in under 10 minutes. They also claim the battery can be fully charged in five minutes. The battery is positioned as a non-lithium solution, though specific chemistry details are not provided in the announcement. The technology is being presented as commercially available, with vehicles supposedly on the road in Q1 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by significant skepticism, with many commenters labeling the announcement as "vaporware" or a potential "rug pull." The primary concerns revolve around the company being a new, unknown entity without partnerships with established brands, patents, or mentions of independent testing. Commenters also pointed out inconsistencies in the charging claims (5 minutes for a full charge vs. 10 minutes for a partial charge in different marketing materials) and the extreme power requirements for such fast charging.

However, the conversation shifted as users investigated the company's connections. It was discovered that Donut Lab is a subsidiary of Verge Motorcycles, which has a physical presence with stores in California. This allows for the possibility of physically inspecting the motorcycle, which lends some credibility to the claims, though it's still a pre-order product.

Further investigation by commenters linked the battery technology to a Finnish company called Nordic Nano, which is reportedly developing a "nanoprinted" battery using abundant, non-lithium materials. This connection provides a potential origin for the technology and explains how a motor company could suddenly produce a breakthrough battery. While some remained unconvinced, this discovery provided a more concrete basis for the claims and tempered the initial "too good to be true" sentiment.

## [Decorative Cryptography](https://www.dlp.rip/decorative-cryptography)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46496494

> **Article:** The article "Decorative Cryptography" argues that many security features are "decorative" because they are designed to thwart a specific, narrow threat model while ignoring others, a concept the author terms "threat model gerrymandering." The piece uses several examples to illustrate this. One is the IBM POWER9 processor, which had physical key imprints on the chip that were intended to prevent physical tampering but were ineffective against a sophisticated interposer attack that could read the bus without disturbing the chip. Another example is the concept of "end-to-end encryption," which the author notes is meaningless if the "ends" (e.g., the OS or application vendor) are untrusted and can access the data before it's encrypted or after it's decrypted. The article concludes that for security to be meaningful, the hardware and software stack must be trusted, and features that obscure the true threat model are more for marketing than for genuine security.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, focusing on the practical realities of implementing and breaking security. A key theme is the difficulty of establishing a true "root of trust." Commenters note that even integrated hardware security features like TPMs are not foolproof, as one must still trust the CPU vendor. The conversation also explores the "decorative" nature of software-based protections. One user shared a detailed, week-long account of bypassing layers of anti-tampering and obfuscation in an application, concluding that such measures are ultimately futile against a determined attacker because software is entirely beholden to the hardware it runs on. The debate around Apple's iMessage E2E encryption was also present, with users debating whether on-device scanning undermines the security promise, though some claimed reports of this were debunked. The phrase "threat model gerrymandering" was widely praised as a brilliant and useful term to describe the practice.

## [CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it (2022)](https://idiallo.com/blog/learn-css)
**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 206 | **ID:** 46500022

> **Article:** The article "CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it" argues that developers' frustration with CSS stems from a fundamental lack of understanding of its core principles. The author contends that instead of learning the language's powerful native features like Flexbox and Grid, developers rely on frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind, which are crutches for this knowledge gap. This leads to over-engineered, "div-soup" HTML structures and an inability to solve novel layout problems. The piece posits that while CSS has a steep learning curve and historical quirks, it is a capable language, and the "it sucks" sentiment is a symptom of developers not investing the time to master their craft.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, with many commenters arguing that the fault lies with CSS itself as much as with developers. A central theme is that CSS is a difficult language to master due to its constant evolution and the need to stay current with design trends. Several users pointed out that CSS lacks the composability and modularity of traditional programming languages, operating like a system of "global mutable state" where class name collisions are a constant risk. This makes building reusable UI components challenging without build-time abstractions.

While some developers shared personal success stories of mastering CSS, many others defended the use of tools like Tailwind CSS not as a symptom of ignorance, but as a pragmatic solution to the poor developer ergonomics and lack of composability in native CSS. The discussion also touched on the distinction between being a UI designer and a developer; one can learn to implement a design without being an artist. Ultimately, the conversation revealed a split between those who believe developers should master the fundamental tool and those who believe the tool itself has inherent flaws that necessitate abstraction layers.

## [Cigarette smoke effect using shaders](https://garden.bradwoods.io/notes/javascript/three-js/shaders/shaders-103-smoke)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46497589

> **Article:** The article presents an interactive tutorial on creating a realistic smoke effect using shaders in Three.js. The technique uses a single plane with a custom shader to simulate smoke without relying on heavy particle systems or pre-rendered textures. The tutorial breaks down the shader code, explaining how to use noise functions (like Simplex noise) to generate organic, moving patterns that mimic the turbulent and dissipating nature of smoke. It's aimed at developers looking to understand the fundamentals of shader programming for visual effects.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively, with many praising the article's interactive design and clear explanation of a complex topic. Several commenters, including those new to shaders, found it a refreshing and cool introduction. The discussion quickly evolved into a technical debate on the best methods for rendering smoke in applications like games. The main approaches compared were:
*   **Shader-based (as shown in the article):** Praised for its small size and efficiency, though some noted it might not be as scalable as other methods.
*   **Particle Systems:** Mentioned as a common and accessible technique, even for non-AAA developers, capable of producing great results.
*   **Pre-rendered Textures/Atlases:** Cited as a likely, simple solution used in many games for performance.
*   **Fluid Dynamics:** A more advanced approach that offers high realism but comes with a significant performance cost and a steeper learning curve.

Beyond the technical comparison, commenters highlighted the educational value of the site, describing shaders as a "gateway" to a new dimension of web development. There were also minor notes, including a correction on a spelling error in the article and a brief, pedantic discussion on the realism of the smoke (pipe vs. cigarette).

## [GOG Patrons- Join gamers keeping classics alive](https://www.gog.com/en/patrons)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46498775

> **Article:** GOG, a digital storefront for classic PC games, has launched a "Patrons" program. This is a subscription service where users can pay a monthly fee (e.g., $5, $10, $20) to become patrons. The stated goal is to support the "GOG Preservation Program," an effort to rescue classic games from being lost to time. This involves legally securing rights to abandoned games, fixing them to be compatible with modern operating systems, and rebuilding missing features, all while staying true to the original experience. The program is framed as a way for the gaming community to directly contribute to keeping gaming history alive.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community had a mixed but engaged reaction to GOG's new patron program. A central theme was skepticism about the financial model and value proposition. Many users questioned the logic of donating to a private, for-profit company, with some suggesting a more transparent model like pre-ordering specific games. There was concern that the program's introduction, following GOG's recent buyback from its parent company, might signal financial distress, though one commenter noted the program predated the buyout.

The discussion also explored the core mission of game preservation. While some praised the goal, others argued that "Good Old Piracy" is a more effective preservation tool, though a counterpoint was raised about the difficulty of getting pirated games to run on modern systems. The legal complexities of "abandonware" were a significant point of contention. One user expressed bafflement that intellectual property rights could be "hoarded" for games not commercially available, while another argued that IP is simply a tradable asset. A recurring suggestion was for GOG to develop or use a universal emulator for old Windows games, similar to how they use DOSBox, to make preservation more efficient.

Finally, several commenters offered specific critiques and suggestions for improvement. A key demand was for financial transparency, specifically that patron funds be explicitly earmarked for preservation and not general revenue. Others felt the program lacked a compelling incentive, suggesting patrons should receive the preserved games as a reward for their contributions. There was also a call for GOG to prioritize Linux support and to be more transparent about which games they plan to preserve.
