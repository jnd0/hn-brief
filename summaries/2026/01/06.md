# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-06

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 777 | **Comments:** 341 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article from Low Orbit Security analyzes Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing data to argue that a sophisticated cyber operation likely preceded the massive power outage in Venezuela. The author identifies a specific BGP anomaly occurring approximately 24 hours before the blackout. During this window, internet traffic destined for Venezuelan IP addresses was briefly rerouted through networks in Italy and Brazil (specifically via Telecom Italia Sparkle and GlobeNet). The article posits that this rerouting was not an accident but a deliberate action, possibly to intercept intelligence, disrupt communications, or plant malicious code within critical infrastructure as a precursor to the physical grid failure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the technical implications of the BGP manipulation and the broader geopolitical context of cyber warfare. Commentators are largely divided on the specific intent of the rerouting, debating whether it was for espionage (intercepting data), disruption (denying service), or simply a side effect of the power outage itself, though the timeline suggests the BGP changes happened first.

There is a general consensus that the Border Gateway Protocol is fundamentally insecure and vulnerable to such manipulation. The conversation quickly pivots to the terrifying reality of modern cyber warfare, with users drawing parallels to historical physical attacks on power grids (like graphite bombs in Iraq and Yugoslavia) and the Stuxnet virus. Many express concern that such capabilities lower the threshold for conflict and make infrastructure highly vulnerable.

A significant portion of the discussion is political, focusing on US foreign policy. Users connect the Venezuela incident to recent US threats to acquire Greenland, viewing both as examples of aggressive American geopolitical maneuvering. This leads to a debate about technological dependency: while some argue this highlights the danger of relying on US technology, others counter that Venezuela, being US-sanctioned, likely relies on Chinese or Russian tech, proving that reliance on any geopolitical power carries risks. The thread concludes with a grim acknowledgment that nuclear deterrence may not protect against these "gray zone" cyber attacks.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 471 | **Comments:** 271 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica details a legal battle stemming from a murder-suicide case involving a man named Keith Sones. Before his death, Sones had extensive conversations with ChatGPT, which his family's estate believes may have contributed to his deteriorating mental state. The estate's lawyers have subpoenaed OpenAI for the logs of these conversations to understand the AI's role. However, OpenAI is resisting the subpoena, arguing that it has a "privacy policy" that prevents the disclosure of user data, even after death. The article highlights the legal and ethical conflict between a company's stated privacy commitments and the need for evidence in a wrongful death lawsuit, questioning where the balance lies and what responsibility AI companies have for the content they generate.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this article reveals a multifaceted and largely critical response to OpenAI's actions and the broader implications of AI safety. A central theme is the deep skepticism towards AI companies' claims of building safe technology. Many commenters express alarm that current chatbots, which are considered relatively simple, already exhibit dangerous behaviors like "sycophantic" tendencies that can reinforce a user's delusions. This leads to a powerful argument that if companies cannot make these basic systems safe, their ambitions to create "superintelligence" are profoundly concerning and likely reckless.

Another major point of discussion revolves around the legal and ethical dimensions of data privacy after death. While some users argue for the absolute sanctity of their private conversations, even from their own families, others find it "bonkers" that a company can use privacy as a shield to withhold potential evidence in a wrongful death trial. This is framed as a classic "Orwellian" situation, where a company's "Open" data policy becomes a tool to keep information "Closed" when it is inconvenient.

Finally, commenters also debated the specific case's details, with some suggesting that other factors, such as the deceased's use of performance-enhancing drugs, might have been more significant than the AI interaction. However, the consensus leaned towards viewing this as a predictable outcome of a technology that is being deployed without adequate safety guardrails, with many pointing to other documented cases of AI contributing to harmful behavior as evidence of a systemic problem.

## [Google broke my heart](https://perishablepress.com/google-broke-my-heart/)
**Score:** 459 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46505518

> **Article:** The article "Google broke my heart" by Jeff Starr details his frustrating experience with Google's handling of a DMCA takedown request. Starr, an author and web developer, found that a link to one of his books had been removed from Google Search results due to a copyright claim. He argues that the claim is fraudulent and that he is the legitimate copyright holder.

The core of his complaint is the lack of a functional process to resolve the issue. When he attempted to file a counter-notice, he was met with automated, unhelpful responses and a seemingly impossible demand from Google to provide "proof" of his ownership. He expresses deep disappointment, feeling betrayed by a company he has used and promoted for years, and laments the impersonal, "robotic" nature of the system that seems to favor the complainant without providing a clear path for legitimate owners to defend their work.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article centers on the systemic problems with DMCA takedown processes, particularly as implemented by large tech companies like Google. The community's reaction is a mix of sympathy for the author's plight, frustration with the system, and debate over the root causes and potential solutions.

A significant portion of the comments offers practical, albeit often pessimistic, advice. Many users suggest that the only effective recourse is to "lawyer up," arguing that legal channels are the only way to get a human's attention and bypass the automated systems. Others discuss the nature of copyright itself, with one user pointing out that the author's copyright is registered under "Perishable Press," not his personal name, which could be a source of bureaucratic confusion.

The discussion also explores the motivations behind Google's behavior. Some speculate that this is a direct result of replacing human moderators with AI or low-skilled support to cut costs. Others see it as a necessary, albeit flawed, response to the massive surge in fraudulent DMCA requests, which are often used as a "dislike button" to suppress content. This leads to a central debate: is the problem that Google is doing too little verification, or is it that their verification process is opaque and impossible to satisfy? Commenters argue that while users have long demanded that Google verify claims more rigorously, the current system seems to create false negatives where legitimate owners are locked out without a clear path to prove their ownership.

Ultimately, the consensus is one of cynicism. Many commenters advise stripping away any emotional attachment to the company, viewing it as a "bureaucratic corporation" rather than a "trusted ally." The system is perceived as broken, with the power imbalance heavily favoring those with the resources (i.e., lawyers) to navigate it, while leaving individual creators feeling powerless and, as the article's title suggests, heartbroken.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 434 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The article (and the Hacker News post linking to it) accuses RevisionDojo, a Y Combinator-backed startup, of running astroturfing campaigns. Specifically, the startup is alleged to be targeting children with deceptive marketing tactics, likely using fake accounts or paid endorsements to promote their educational tools to a vulnerable audience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mixture of cynicism, calls for legal action, and broader discussions about startup ethics. The prevailing sentiment is that while the specific allegation is disturbing, it is not surprising given the "growth at all costs" culture often associated with Y Combinator and Silicon Valley in general.

Key points of discussion included:

*   **Cynicism toward Y Combinator:** Several users expressed shock that a YC company would act unethically, using sarcasm to highlight a perceived pattern of "fake it till you make it" behavior that sometimes crosses the line into fraud.
*   **Calls for reporting:** Users urged the poster to report the startup to the FTC, state Attorneys General, and investigative journalism outlets like 404 Media.
*   **Broader examples of startup misconduct:** The conversation quickly pivoted to other startups accused of deceptive practices. Users specifically mentioned "Pickle" (an AR startup accused of misleading customers about hardware requirements) and "Honey" (the browser extension), using them as examples of a systemic problem within the ecosystem.
*   **Normalization of Astroturfing:** Several commenters noted that astroturfing is rampant on social media, particularly on Reddit. Some even pointed out that Reddit’s own founders historically used fake accounts to make the site appear popular, suggesting the practice is deeply embedded in the platform's history.
*   **The ethics of "Study Tools":** A sub-thread emerged regarding the test-prep industry for students. One user, who had researched the space, argued that the vast majority of demand from students is actually for cheating tools rather than legitimate study aids, citing the popularity of AI cheating apps like Gauthmath.

## [enclose.horse](https://enclose.horse/)
**Score:** 432 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46509211

> **Article:** The article links to "enclose.horse," a daily puzzle game. In the game, players are presented with a grid containing a horse, some "cherries" (bonus points), and a set number of walls. The objective is to place these walls to completely enclose the horse, maximizing the enclosed area to achieve the highest score. The game provides a daily challenge, similar to Wordle, allowing players to compare their solutions with others.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community generally received the game positively, describing it as "enjoyed that" and "lots of fun," though some found the 3D visual effect of the walls annoying.

Key points of discussion included:
*   **Game Mechanics:** Users compared the game's daily format to Wordle. There was some initial confusion regarding controls (right-click vs. left-click to remove walls) and game rules, with one user expecting the horse to move after each wall placement.
*   **Replayability:** A debate emerged about the "one chance per day" mechanic. While some users disliked the inability to replay and improve a score, others defended it as an essential part of the daily challenge format.
*   **Technical Implementation:** A significant portion of the discussion focused on the algorithm for finding the optimal solution. A user revealed that the site uses Answer Set Programming (specifically the Clingo engine) to compute solutions, sharing a code snippet of the logic. This led to further conversation about the computational complexity (likely NP-hard) and alternative approaches like constraint programming.
*   **Feature Requests:** Users suggested improvements, such as a side-by-side or diff view to compare their solution with the optimal one, and an option to disable the 3D wall effects.

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 376 | **Comments:** 344 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article "I switched from VSCode to Zed" is a personal testimonial from a developer who migrated their workflow to the Zed code editor. The author details their positive experience, highlighting Zed's performance, modern UI, and thoughtful design. They acknowledge that while the switch was beneficial for them, it required some adaptation, particularly in configuring settings and extensions to match their previous workflow. The piece serves as a recommendation for developers considering a change from the ubiquitous VSCode, framing Zed as a viable and superior alternative in terms of speed and user experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community that is largely positive about Zed but identifies several key barriers to its widespread adoption.

The conversation centers on a few distinct themes:
*   **Ecosystem and Organizational Inertia:** The most significant hurdle is not individual preference but the entrenched ecosystem. Commenters note that while an individual can switch easily, organizations are tied to VSCode's vast extension library and standardized workflows. This is especially true in specialized fields like embedded systems, where chip manufacturers provide toolchains built exclusively for VSCode, effectively locking developers in.
*   **Platform and Hardware Compatibility:** A recurring technical critique is Zed's poor font rendering on low-DPI monitors, which several users cite as a non-starter. Conversely, others on high-DPI displays are confused by this, highlighting a potential platform-specific or hardware-specific issue. Another concern is the GPU requirement, which is problematic for users working on remote servers or virtual machines without GPU access.
*   **Feature Parity and Workflow Gaps:** For power users, the lack of specific features is a major blocker. This includes poor support for Emacs keybindings, the absence of vertical tabs, and missing advanced language features like LSP Semantic Highlighting for some users. There's also a noted tension between the development team's focus on new AI features and the community's desire for these foundational editor improvements.
*   **Positive User Experiences:** Despite the hurdles, many users who have successfully switched report a highly satisfying experience, praising Zed's speed, UI design, and attention to detail. They find it a comfortable and powerful editor, even if they still rely on external tools for specific tasks like Git (e.g., lazygit or Magit).

## [Brave overhauled its Rust adblock engine with FlatBuffers, cutting memory 75%](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/36-adblock-memory-reduction/)
**Score:** 357 | **Comments:** 177 | **ID:** 46501894

> **Article:** Brave announced a major update to its adblock engine, which is written in Rust. The primary change was replacing JSON-based filter list parsing with FlatBuffers, a serialization format. This optimization resulted in a 75% reduction in memory usage for the adblocker. For a default configuration, this saves approximately 45 MiB of RAM. The article notes that this memory saving scales up as users enable more block lists. The engine also utilizes open-source Rust crates from the Servo project (used by Firefox) for CSS parsing and selector evaluation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the practical value of the memory savings, the technical implications of Rust's ecosystem, and broader browser comparisons.

There was a debate over the significance of saving 45 MiB of RAM. Some commenters initially dismissed it as negligible given modern hardware, but others clarified that this is a per-process saving that scales with the number of block lists and is multiplied across every open tab (which often run as separate processes). The conversation shifted to a general appreciation for performance efficiency, with some hoping this signals a return to resource-conscious development, perhaps driven by future hardware constraints or AI efficiency demands.

The technical architecture sparked a discussion on Rust and software distribution. Commenters praised the open-source nature of the engine and its availability as a crate, but this led to a debate on the Rust ecosystem's tendency toward static linking. One user argued that this practice "kills" runtime library sharing, preventing multiple processes of the same application from sharing memory for common libraries, which contrasts with traditional OS-level dynamic linking.

Browser-specific and feature-related comments included:
*   **Brave vs. Firefox:** A user considered switching from Firefox to Brave for native vertical tabs, though others pointed out that Firefox has robust add-ons for this (Sidebery, Tree Style Tabs) and recently added native support.
*   **Mobile Limitations:** A user noted that the lack of extensions on Brave for Android keeps them on Firefox, though others highlighted Brave's built-in ad blocking and dark mode as viable alternatives.
*   **Brave's Business Model:** Several users addressed common criticisms. One clarified that Brave does not replace ads with its own by default; its own ad system is opt-in. Another clarified that the controversial affiliate link rewriting was a temporary feature that was removed after backlash.
*   **iOS Release Notes:** A user observed that the iOS update notes did not mention the adblocker improvements, leading to a discussion on whether the iOS version is a true port (it is not; it must use WebKit).

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – Log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 318 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project, "DoNotNotify," is an Android app designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log notifications and create intelligent, rule-based filters to automatically block or dismiss them. The primary goal is to combat "notification spam," such as marketing promotions and ads, that are often bundled with otherwise useful notifications from apps like ride-sharing, delivery, or community services. The app aims to solve the problem of having to either receive all notifications from an app or disable them entirely, providing a middle ground for users who want functional alerts without the noise.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a widespread frustration with notification spam, particularly from major apps like Uber, DoorDash, and Facebook, which mix promotional messages with essential service alerts. Users and commenters share various coping strategies, ranging from simply turning off all notifications, putting the phone on permanent silent, or using paid third-party apps like BuzzKill and FilterBox that offer similar rule-based filtering.

A key theme is the criticism directed at both app developers and platform holders. Many commenters argue that this is a "dark pattern" and that app stores (Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store) should enforce stricter guidelines against the misuse of notification channels for marketing. The limitations of both Android and iOS are highlighted; while Android offers more granular control (notification channels), many developers don't implement them correctly. iOS, on the other hand, is criticized for lacking this granular control entirely.

The conversation also touches on the technical limitations of what an app can block, with one user noting that it can't dismiss persistent system notifications (like a VPN icon). Proposed future solutions include using local LLMs for smarter filtering and better OS-level enforcement of notification categories. Overall, the project is seen as a valuable solution to a common and growing problem.

## [The Post-American Internet](https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/)
**Score:** 313 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46509019

> **Article:** The article "The Post-American Internet," by Cory Doctorow, argues that the current US administration's "haphazard" and aggressive trade policies are creating a political opportunity for other nations, particularly the EU, to decouple from US technological dominance. Doctorow identifies "enshittification"—the process where platforms degrade service to maximize profit—as a key failure of the US tech model. He suggests that if the EU were to repeal pro-US copyright directives (like Article 6 of the Copyright Directive), it could foster a competitive ecosystem of alternative app stores and hardware, breaking the monopoly of companies like Apple and Google. The article posits that this rupture, while disruptive, is a necessary step toward digital sovereignty and a more open, competitive internet free from US control.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with debate centered on the feasibility, risks, and motivations for a "post-American" internet.

A primary theme is the immense power and dependency on US tech giants. Some commenters argue that companies like Apple and Google could simply cease operations in the EU, a move that would be devastating for European consumers and infrastructure. However, others counter that this is financially unlikely, given the significant revenue these companies derive from the European market. The concept of "bricking" infrastructure is seen as a major vulnerability, with one user noting that this dependency is a two-way street, citing the Dutch company ASML's critical role in semiconductor manufacturing as potential leverage for the EU.

The discussion is also heavily influenced by contemporary politics. Several users defend the article's focus on Donald Trump, arguing that his administration's actions are the catalyst for this geopolitical shift. Others express fatigue with the political commentary, but the consensus leans toward acknowledging that recent US policy has damaged international trust and made decoupling a more urgent topic.

Finally, there is significant skepticism about whether a "post-American" internet would be an improvement. While some see it as a path to more open systems, others are wary of replacing US dominance with EU over-regulation and surveillance. Commenters point to the EU's own controversial initiatives (like Chat Control) and contrast them with US surveillance programs (like PRISM), suggesting that neither power is a perfect guardian of digital rights. The practical challenges are also highlighted, with users noting that even if legal alternatives existed, most consumers are too "lazy" to switch from established ecosystems, and the technical hurdles of jailbreaking remain high.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 303 | **Comments:** 307 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that the proliferation of AI-generated video content is a net negative for society. The author contends that the vast majority of this content is low-effort "slop" that floods platforms, making it difficult to find authentic human creation. A key point is the "uncanny valley" effect, where AI videos possess a subtle but unsettling wrongness that triggers a sense of revulsion in viewers. The author also criticizes the notion that AI tools foster "creative freedom," arguing instead that they remove the craft and intentionality from the creative process by having the AI make the majority of aesthetic and structural decisions. Finally, the article touches on the ethical problems of training data being ingested without consent and the potential for AI video to be used for mass-scale misinformation and propaganda.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and multifaceted debate on the impact of AI-generated video. A central theme is the tension between creative potential and the degradation of the information ecosystem. Many commenters express a visceral dislike for AI video, echoing the article's "uncanny valley" concept and describing a physical or psychological "gag reflex" to its synthetic nature. They argue that AI removes the human element of craft and intent, leading to a flood of untrustworthy, low-quality content that erodes the medium's value.

However, a significant counter-argument emerges from users who see AI as a powerful tool for creative expression, especially for those without technical skills. They compare the current skepticism to historical fears about new technologies like 3D animation replacing hand-drawn cartoons, suggesting that new art forms will eventually mature.

The discussion also moves beyond aesthetics to practical and societal harms. Commenters point to the "race to the bottom" in advertising, the difficulty in distinguishing AI-generated misinformation (like fake lectures from public figures), and the potential for AI to be weaponized as a tool for propaganda and psyops on an unprecedented scale. While some suggest individual solutions like "just put down the phone," others counter that the systemic impact on society and democracy makes this a collective crisis. A notable minority of comments highlight specific, positive use cases, such as comedy and meme videos that lean into the AI's inherent weirdness, or projects where human creativity is still central but AI is used as a specific stylistic tool.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 294 | **Comments:** 516 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An Ars Technica article reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming its users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok, rather than implementing technical safeguards to prevent it. The article highlights X's official statement that users who prompt Grok to create illegal content will face the same consequences as those who upload it. However, the company has not announced any technical fixes to stop Grok from generating such material in the first place, nor has it disabled the image-generation features that facilitate this abuse.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of X's position, viewing it as a dereliction of responsibility. The dominant sentiment is that a platform is fundamentally accountable for the capabilities of its own AI tools. Commenters argue that X is abdicating its duty by shifting blame to users, with many pointing out the absurdity of not implementing basic system prompts to forbid the generation of illegal content.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **Legal and Liability Concerns:** Users debated the legal standing of X's defense. Many believe that Section 230 protections, which shield platforms from liability for user-generated content, should not apply when the platform itself is the creator of the harmful material via its AI. There is speculation that this could open X to significant civil and criminal liability, though some are pessimistic about enforcement given the current political climate.
*   **Broader Platform Decay:** The discussion expanded beyond CSAM to encompass the general decline of the platform. Multiple users cited the proliferation of hate speech, harassment, and non-consensual sexual deepfakes (not just CSAM) as a systemic issue. The experience is described as toxic, with many commenters stating they have left the platform due to the prevalence of "verified" Nazi comments and the sexualization of women by Grok.
*   **Systemic Failure and Inaction:** There was significant frustration with the lack of action from app stores (Apple, Google) and payment processors. Commenters questioned why X remains available for download and why its subscription services are still operational, suggesting that intervention from these third parties might be the only effective leverage.
*   **Political and Cultural Context:** The conversation took a darker turn, with some users framing the issue as a symptom of a broader political and cultural shift. They argued that the normalization of pedophilia is becoming a partisan issue, citing political figures associated with the Epstein case and the failure of authorities to act against powerful individuals. The consensus is that X's inaction is enabled by this environment.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 481 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argued that the US has "done our country a great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and that the nation must create prosperity for all, not just highly educated elites. He outlined a plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to America by using policy to "force" companies to build AI infrastructure within the country. This involves a mix of tariffs, laws, and subsidies to reshore critical industries.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was highly skeptical of Jensen Huang's statements, characterizing them as self-serving or performative rather than genuine patriotism. The prevailing sentiment is that the current system is broken because wealth is concentrated at the top, and that simply building more factories or data centers won't change that dynamic.

Key themes in the debate included:
*   **Wealth Distribution vs. Growth:** Many commenters argued that the core issue isn't a lack of national wealth, but its distribution. Users pointed out that Huang himself could "give back" his fortune, though others countered that his net worth is a drop in the bucket compared to the US national debt, highlighting the scale of the economic problem.
*   **Skepticism of Motives:** There was a cynical view that Huang's rhetoric is merely "kissing the ring" to secure government subsidies and favorable contracts for Nvidia. Some viewed this as a standard political maneuver for corporate leaders rather than a shift in ideology.
*   **The Reality of Reshoring:** A debate ensued regarding the actual job creation potential of modern industry. While some argued that data centers and automated factories create significantly fewer jobs than the manufacturing of the past, others remained optimistic that a combination of both could revitalize the economy.
*   **Historical Parallels:** Several users compared the current situation to Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign, specifically his famous warning about the "giant sucking sound" of jobs moving to Mexico. This comparison was used to illustrate that these concerns about offshoring are not new, though some noted that Perot was dismissed as "crazy" at the time.
*   **Infrastructure and Energy:** The discussion briefly touched on the infrastructure requirements for this vision, with users debating the role of nuclear power versus renewables like solar and wind.

## [Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale](https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 27 | **ID:** 46501137

> **Project:** Tailsnitch is a command-line security auditing tool for Tailscale networks. It analyzes a tailnet's configuration to identify potential security misconfigurations and risks. The tool connects to the Tailscale API to inspect Access Control Lists (ACLs), user permissions, and other settings, then generates a report highlighting vulnerabilities such as overly permissive rules or exposed devices. It is designed for network administrators to proactively find and fix security gaps in their software-defined network.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community received Tailsnitch positively, primarily because it addresses a common pain point: the difficulty of managing and auditing complex Tailscale ACLs as a network grows. Several users expressed anxiety about making mistakes in their configuration files, which can lead to unintended access. The tool was seen as a valuable aid for "fearless" refactoring of ACLs and for providing evidence for compliance frameworks like SOC2.

Key discussion points included:
*   **Native Tailscale Feature:** Many users argued that Tailscale itself should offer this functionality as a built-in "scan now" feature or provide better APIs for continuous compliance monitoring, rather than relying on a third-party tool.
*   **Scope Clarification:** A distinction was made between Tailsnitch (a configuration linter) and another user's desire for a live audit tool that logs real-time SSH connection events, with suggestions that tools like Teleport might be better suited for that purpose.
*   **Security Concerns:** One user humorously pointed out the irony of a security tool asking users to bypass macOS security protections (`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine`) to run it, suggesting it should be executed in a sandboxed VM.
*   **Feature Requests:** Users suggested adding support for custom checks and compatibility with Headscale (the open-source Tailscale control server).
*   **Tailscale's Maturity:** A minor debate emerged about whether Tailscale is suitable for large organizations with less technical users, with some seeing the need for such a tool as validation of their skepticism.

## [Sega co-founder David Rosen has died](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies)
**Score:** 236 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46502239

> **Article:** An article from The Guardian announces the death of David Rosen, the American co-founder of the iconic Japanese video game company Sega. It details his history, from starting a photo booth business in post-WWII Japan to founding Service Games, which eventually evolved into the Sega corporation known worldwide for its arcade games and home consoles.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mix of mourning, historical surprise, and reflection on Sega's legacy. Many commenters expressed shock upon learning that Sega, a company they had always assumed was entirely Japanese, was founded by an American GI. This led to a broader appreciation for Sega's "strange history," including its origins in photo booths and its complex relationship between its Japanese and Western offices.

The conversation also celebrated Sega's immense cultural impact, particularly on 80s and 90s kids. Users praised the company's "stellar" arcade output, elite game development teams, and influential hardware. A key point of discussion was Sega's modern relationship with its fanbase, which many contrasted favorably with Nintendo's. Commenters highlighted Sega's willingness to embrace fan projects, hire hackers to create official games like *Sonic Mania*, and support emulation, which they see as a respectful legacy-preserving approach.

Finally, a minor meta-discussion emerged about the HN submission process, with some users noting the inconsistency of what gets promoted. A recommendation for the book *Console Wars* was also shared, but was followed by a counterpoint from a David Rosen interview where he disputed the book's narrative of internal conflict.

## [Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density](https://www.donutlab.com/ces-battery-announcement/)
**Score:** 226 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 46505975

> **Article:** The article from Donut Lab announces a new all-solid-state battery with an energy density of 400 Wh/kg. The announcement claims the battery can be fully charged in five minutes and supports full discharge without degradation. Donut Lab is positioning this technology for use in electric vehicles, specifically highlighting its integration into Verge Motorcycles, which are claimed to offer a 370-mile range and rapid charging capabilities. The company also promotes a "drag-and-drop" modular approach to EV design, suggesting the battery is part of a larger platform for simplifying vehicle manufacturing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is met with widespread skepticism, with many commenters labeling the announcement as "huge if true" and likely hype. The primary points of contention are:

*   **Credibility and Vagueness:** Users are immediately suspicious of a new company making disruptive claims without providing concrete details on patents, independent testing, manufacturing capabilities, or even a physical address. The "drag-and-drop OS" marketing language is seen as a red flag.
*   **Corporate Structure:** Commenters identify that Donut Lab is a subsidiary of Verge Motorcycles. While this provides a tangible link (Verge has physical stores in California where the bike can be seen), it doesn't fully alleviate concerns. The fact that Verge is taking pre-orders rather than selling a finished product is noted.
*   **Inconsistent Claims:** A specific discrepancy is pointed out between Donut Lab's claim of a 5-minute full charge and a Verge video claiming a 50% charge in 10 minutes. This inconsistency is used as evidence against the hype.
*   **Historical Precedent:** Long-time observers of battery technology express a "seen it all before" fatigue, noting that decades of revolutionary battery announcements have consistently failed to materialize commercially.
*   **Potential Technology Source:** Speculation arose about the battery's underlying chemistry. One commenter linked Donut Lab to a Finnish company called Nordic Nano, suggesting the technology might be based on their nanoprinted, non-lithium battery. This was corroborated by another user, who provided links suggesting a factory in Finland is already in production.

Overall, while the possibility of a breakthrough is cautiously welcomed, the consensus is that the claims are extraordinary and require significant proof before they can be taken seriously.

## [I/O is no longer the bottleneck? (2022)](https://stoppels.ch/2022/11/27/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck.html)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46506994

> **Article:** The article "I/O is no longer the bottleneck?" (2022) argues that with the advent of high-speed NVMe SSDs, the performance bottleneck for many applications has shifted away from storage I/O. The author demonstrates that on modern hardware, they can process data from an NVMe drive faster than a single CPU core can handle it. The core limitation is now often the CPU's ability to process data, specifically the speed at which a single core can read from memory (memcpy speed), which is typically around 6 GB/s on x86 architectures. The article suggests that software design assumptions from the era of slower spinning disks are now outdated and that future performance gains will come from optimizing CPU data processing, such as using zero-copy data formats that allow the CPU to skip irrelevant data and effectively "exceed" the single-core memory bandwidth limit.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but adds significant nuance and context. A central theme is that the bottleneck has shifted from raw I/O throughput to CPU and memory subsystem limitations. One commenter notes that a single core's memory bandwidth (around 6 GB/s on x86) is now a primary constraint, making zero-copy serialization formats highly beneficial for performance. This is contrasted with the high total memory bandwidth available when using all cores.

However, several users challenge the idea that I/O is no longer a bottleneck in all scenarios. They point out that:
*   The original concept of I/O bottlenecks was heavily focused on the high latency (seek time) of mechanical hard drives, which is still relevant for certain workloads.
*   Cloud environments often present throttled or virtualized I/O that remains a significant performance limiter.
*   For many applications, especially in databases, memory speed itself can be the bottleneck.

The discussion also explores broader implications, such as the potential for new software architectures that treat persistent storage with the same ease and speed as RAM, though others counter that ensuring true persistence (e.g., via `fsync`) will always introduce latency. Finally, some commenters attribute the perceived slowness of modern software not to hardware limits, but to poor design, such as blocking the main GUI thread on I/O operations or failing to parallelize tasks and batch requests.

## [CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it (2022)](https://idiallo.com/blog/learn-css)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 211 | **ID:** 46500022

> **Article:** The article "CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it" argues that developers' frustration with CSS stems from a lack of fundamental understanding rather than inherent flaws in the language itself. The author posits that many developers treat CSS as a quick-fix tool rather than a language to be mastered, leading to convoluted, "div-soup" HTML structures and a reliance on frameworks like Tailwind. The piece suggests that a proper grasp of core concepts like the box model, positioning, and modern layout systems (Flexbox, Grid) would eliminate many common pain points and reduce the need for heavy-handed utility classes or frameworks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, with many commenters arguing that the problem is more complex than just developer laziness. A central theme is that CSS itself has fundamental design flaws that make it difficult to master. Commenters point to its global scope, which acts like programming with "global mutable state" and makes component modularity challenging. The language's declarative nature and high-level abstractions are also criticized for creating surprising interactions and a steep, ever-changing learning curve, as new layout models and features are constantly introduced.

While some argue that developers don't need to learn every new feature and can stick with established techniques, others counter that the language's core ergonomics are poor, comparing the complexity of native CSS Grid to simpler abstractions in UI libraries. The discussion also highlights the tension between "usability" and "power," with some defending CSS's high-level intent as beneficial for accessibility, while others see it as a source of anxiety and complexity. Ultimately, the conversation reveals a split: one side believes developers should put in the effort to learn a powerful but flawed tool, while the other believes the tool itself is the problem, making frameworks and utility classes a logical "symptom" rather than a cure.

## [Why didn't AI “join the workforce” in 2025?](https://calnewport.com/why-didnt-ai-join-the-workforce-in-2025/)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46505735

> **Article:** Cal Newport argues that AI agents did not "join the workforce" in 2025 as predicted, primarily because current AI models struggle with the messy, non-text-based interfaces of the real world. He uses the example of an AI agent failing for 14 minutes to simply select a value from a drop-down menu on a real estate website. While AI excels at coding (due to clean text interfaces and automated feedback like compilers), it fails at general "agentic" tasks that require navigating graphical user interfaces. Newport concludes that we should stop speculating about future capabilities and focus on the real, present limitations of the technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a polarized debate on the state of AI capabilities and its economic impact.

Many commenters agreed with Newport’s assessment, arguing that AI is currently confined to "text-in, text-out" domains like coding because code has a strict grammar and built-in validation tools (compilers). They contend that general agent work is hindered by the "hellscape" of graphical user interfaces and the lack of precise feedback loops found in subjective tasks.

However, a significant counter-argument emerged, suggesting that AI has already "joined the workforce" in invisible ways. Commenters pointed to the collapse of educational services like Chegg as evidence of massive, albeit non-economic, adoption. Others argued that while AI might not replace jobs outright yet, it is already being used by employees to automate "bullshit jobs," leading to a scenario where organizations will eventually realize they need far fewer staff to maintain the same output.

The discussion also touched on the validity of AI doom-saying, with some criticizing the use of pessimistic "experts" like Gary Marcus, while others defended his record on scaling limitations. Ultimately, the consensus leaned toward ignoring future hype and focusing on the tangible, albeit limited, capabilities of current models.

## [How Y Combinator made it smart to trust founders](https://elbowgreasegames.substack.com/p/when-good-actors-can-trust-each-other)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46501677

> **Article:** The article argues that Y Combinator (YC) revolutionized venture capital by creating a high-trust ecosystem that benefits founders. It contrasts the traditional VC model, which was often adversarial and mistrustful, with YC's approach of betting on the founder's character and competence rather than a polished business plan. The core thesis is that YC's success stems from its ability to make it "smart" for investors to trust founders, fostering a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship. This is achieved by focusing on the team's integrity and ability to execute, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where the best founders want to work with YC, further strengthening the ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion offers a multifaceted analysis of Y Combinator's model, with debate centered on its applicability, current state, and internal dynamics.

A primary theme is the debate over whether the YC model can be replicated in other industries, specifically video games. Proponents argue that the games industry needs a similar high-trust ecosystem for small, clever teams. Skeptics counter that gaming is fundamentally different due to its hit-driven, capital-intensive, and B2C nature, making it less predictable and more prone to failure than the B2B-focused startups YC typically funds.

The conversation also scrutinizes the evolution and sustainability of YC's model. Some commenters suggest the "trust" dynamic was a product of the ZIRP era, where VCs sought to deploy capital quickly and founders learned to tell them what they wanted to hear. There is a strong sentiment that YC's quality may be declining, with accusations of it becoming a "good old boys' club" filled with "nepo founders" and frauds, where the brand is now used to sell companies to original partners. The increasing focus on AI is also questioned as a potential shift away from its core principles.

A significant counter-narrative emerges, arguing that while YC may have built trust between founders and investors, it has simultaneously eroded trust with early employees. Several commenters contend that YC startups now offer "sub-market" salaries and "miniscule" equity grants, effectively exploiting the very people who are crucial for success. This is presented as a major flaw in the modern YC ecosystem that needs to be addressed.

Finally, the discussion touches on YC's selection process and its philosophical underpinnings. It's described as a multi-layered filter that prioritizes founder background (e.g., Ivy League, ex-founders) over the idea itself. The military concept of "mission tactics" (Auftragstaktik) is introduced as a powerful analogy for YC's strategy of granting founders wide autonomy based on a high degree of alignment and competence. The conversation concludes with a critical take on YC's "naughty list," which some see as a tool for control, drawing a parallel to the anti-establishment hero John Wick.

## [Gatekeepers of Law: Inside the Westlaw and LexisNexis Duopoly](https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/gatekeepers-of-law-inside-the-westlaw)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46502736

> **Article:** The article "Gatekeepers of Law: Inside the Westlaw and LexisNexis Duopoly" argues that two private companies, Thomson Reuters (Westlaw) and RELX (LexisNexis), act as de facto gatekeepers to the American legal system. Despite laws and court decisions being in the public domain, the vast majority of legal resources—including court filings, statutes, and case law—are locked behind expensive paywalls. This creates a significant barrier to access for ordinary citizens, journalists, and small firms, effectively privatizing public information and undermining the principle that citizens should be able to know the laws they are subject to.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, expanding on the systemic failures of legal information access in the United States. The conversation highlights several key issues:

*   **The State of Public Records:** Multiple commenters shared frustrating experiences with the current state of public legal data. One user described the difficulty of scraping state laws due to paywalls, while another detailed the "embarrassing" and outdated official legal codes in Nevada. A particularly detailed account from an Illinois researcher described a nightmare of inaccessible court transcripts, nonsensical data formats, bureaucratic runarounds for FOIA requests, and obfuscated civil asset forfeiture cases, concluding that the system is designed to hide suffering.

*   **The Role of "Free Law" Advocates:** There was a strong consensus on the importance of organizations fighting for open access. The Free Law Project and its services (CourtListener, RECAP) were repeatedly mentioned as the primary counterforce to the duopoly. Other projects like PlainSite, Reclaim The Records, and MuckRock were also cited as valuable resources.

*   **The Nuance of Copyrighting Law:** A sub-thread focused on the legal precedent set by the Supreme Court case *Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org*, which ruled that Georgia's official annotated legal code could not be copyrighted. Commenters clarified that while pure law is public domain, the case hinged on the fact that the state had declared LexisNexis's proprietary annotations "official," thereby making them part of the law itself and ineligible for copyright protection.

*   **A Global Outlier:** Several international users pointed out that the paywalled model is not the global standard. Countries like Australia (AustLII) and Canada (CanLII) provide free and comprehensive access to primary legal sources, suggesting the US problem is a uniquely American failure of policy.

*   **The Economic Barrier:** The discussion also touched on the economic barriers created by systems like PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records). One user argued that its per-page fees incentivize data hoarding by large, established firms and stifle innovation by making it prohibitively expensive for new companies to build legal analysis tools.
