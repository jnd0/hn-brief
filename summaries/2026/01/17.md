## [ASCII characters are not pixels: a deep dive into ASCII rendering](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering)
**Score:** 571 | **Comments:** 68 | **ID:** 46657122

> **Article:** The article "ASCII characters are not pixels: a deep dive into ASCII rendering" by Alex Harri provides a technical walkthrough of converting images into ASCII art. The author explains that ASCII characters are not simple pixels but have distinct shapes and varying visual densities. The core of the article details a step-by-step algorithm to improve the fidelity of the rendering. It starts with a basic approach of matching grayscale values but quickly moves to more advanced techniques. Key improvements include sampling the character bitmaps at multiple points rather than just averaging them, and applying a power function to the sampled values to exaggerate contrast and better match the perceptual density of characters. The article is highly visual, featuring interactive widgets that allow readers to see the effects of each algorithmic change in real-time, demonstrating how the final output becomes a more accurate representation of the source image.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters praising the article for its depth, clarity, and excellent interactive visualizations. Many found the author's iterative approach to improving the algorithm satisfying and educational.

The conversation quickly branched out into related technical topics and existing solutions. A key point was the trade-off between speed and quality. One commenter noted that the article's method prioritizes speed, while a brute-force approach of comparing every character's full bitmap against the target would yield better results at a higher computational cost. This led to discussions on optimization, with suggestions like using large HashMaps for pre-calculated character data.

Several existing libraries were mentioned, most notably `libcaca` and `chafa`. `Chafa` was highlighted as a particularly powerful and high-quality tool that uses an 8x8 bitmap for each glyph and is considered difficult to beat. The conversation also touched on the history of the problem, recalling that early computer monitors that could only display characters faced this exact challenge.

Finally, commenters explored future extensions of the technique, such as incorporating color (which adds significant complexity) and using proportional fonts. The topic of color space was briefly mentioned, with a suggestion that RGB might not be the optimal model for this task. The article was widely seen as a great resource for understanding the creative challenges that arise from technical constraints.

## [Slop is everywhere for those with eyes to see](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/slop-is-everywhere-for-those-with-eyes-to-see/)
**Score:** 295 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46651443

> **Article:** The article "Slop is everywhere for those with eyes to see" explores the concept of "AI slop"—low-effort, algorithmically generated content flooding digital platforms. It argues that while human creativity is finite and requires significant effort, the demand for content (driven by infinite-scroll feeds like TikTok's "For You Page") has outstripped the supply of authentic human creation. This gap is being filled by AI, which can produce vast quantities of content, but lacks originality and soul. The piece suggests that as slop becomes ubiquitous, it may devalue digital spaces, potentially driving people back toward "real life" experiences or creating a bifurcation between high-quality human content and the sea of AI-generated noise.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with users expressing concern and fatigue over the proliferation of AI-generated content. A central theme is the tension between the infinite supply of AI slop and the finite nature of human attention and quality. Users debate whether the market is oversaturated with content or if true creativity remains scarce; many agree that while consumption is capped at 24 hours a day, the ease of production via AI is flooding feeds with low-quality material that drowns out genuine human effort.

Several commenters share personal strategies for coping, such as aggressively curating their feeds with browser extensions (e.g., uBlock Origin filters) to block recommendations and social media distractions, or abandoning platforms like Instagram altogether. There's a palpable sense of resignation mixed with resistance—some hope that the sheer volume of slop might eventually break humanity's addiction to screens, while others are simply trying to "avert their eyes" and prioritize offline life.

The discussion also touches on linguistic pet peeves (e.g., the misuse of "exacerbated" vs. "exasperated" and "hone in on" vs. "home in on"), which some saw as off-topic but reflected a broader anxiety about cultural degradation. A few users noted the irony of critiquing AI slop while appreciating the article's vintage web design and typography, highlighting a longing for authenticity in digital aesthetics. Overall, the comments paint a picture of a community grappling with the erosion of genuine human creativity in the face of algorithmic efficiency, with many seeking ways to reclaim their attention and find meaning beyond the feed.

## [US electricity demand surged in 2025 – solar handled 61% of it](https://electrek.co/2026/01/16/us-electricity-demand-surged-in-2025-solar-handled-61-percent/)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 267 | **ID:** 46656903

> **Article:** The linked article from Electrek reports that US electricity demand increased in 2025 and that solar power accounted for 61% of this surge. The piece frames this as a major success for renewable energy deployment, highlighting the rapid growth and cost-effectiveness of solar installations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the article, focusing on three main themes: the accuracy of the headline, the reasons behind the demand surge, and the practical realities of solar energy.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the headline's claim that "solar handled 61% of [demand]." Multiple users argue this is misleading. They clarify that solar likely provided 61% of the *new* electricity generation needed for the 3% demand increase, not 61% of the total US electricity demand. Commenters express frustration with what they perceive as inaccurate or overly optimistic reporting, with some calling for the article's removal.

Beyond the headline, users speculate on the cause of the demand surge, with the top comment pointing to data centers and LLMs as the likely driver. This connects to a discussion on Jevons paradox, where increased efficiency and supply (in this case, cheaper solar) can lead to greater overall consumption rather than reduced usage.

Finally, the conversation explores the practical challenges and trade-offs of solar energy. While some users praise solar for its potential for rapid, decentralized deployment, others caution that grid-scale integration requires significant technical and political coordination. Personal anecdotes highlight that the financial viability of rooftop solar is highly dependent on local conditions, electricity rates, and utility policies. A notable point of contention is land use, with one user arguing against converting farmland for solar farms and advocating instead for installations on buildings and parking lots, a sentiment that prompted discussion on agrivoltaics (combining agriculture and solar on the same land).

## [PCs refuse to shut down after Microsoft patch](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/patch_tuesday_secure_launch_bug_no_shutdown/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 209 | **ID:** 46656998

> **Article:** A recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update has caused a bug where some Windows PCs refuse to shut down via the standard Start Menu or GUI options. The issue, reportedly linked to the "Secure Launch" feature, affects Windows 11 versions 23H2 and 24H2, primarily on Enterprise and IoT editions. Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and provided a workaround: using the command "shutdown /s /t 0" in the command prompt forces an immediate shutdown. The article notes that while the bug is inconvenient, it is unlikely to cause hardware damage as modern systems have thermal protections.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the declining quality of Microsoft software and the barriers to switching operating systems. Many commenters express frustration with Microsoft's perceived reliance on unpaid "Windows Insiders" for quality assurance rather than professional testers, with some sarcastically referring to the company as employing "vibe-coders." There is a recurring sentiment that such bugs are becoming increasingly common and represent a broader trend of sloppiness in Windows updates.

However, the conversation also highlights the difficulty of moving away from Windows. While some users note a growing trend of switching to Linux—driven by dissatisfaction with ads and OS bloat—others argue that the "lifetime of Windows usage" and the deep integration of Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, Outlook) create significant inertia for both individuals and businesses. The consensus is that for non-technical users and cost-conscious companies, the convenience of Microsoft's all-in-one ecosystem often outweighs the frustrations with quality control. A minority of comments focused on the potential physical risks of the bug, such as laptops overheating in backpacks, though others countered that thermal throttling usually prevents hardware damage.

## [LWN is currently under the heaviest scraper attack seen yet](https://social.kernel.org/notice/B2JlhcxNTfI8oDVoyO)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46651887

> **Article:** LWN.net, a long-standing Linux and open-source news site, is experiencing what its operators describe as the heaviest scraper attack they have ever seen. The incident was reported on social media, noting that the attack was severe enough to disrupt site access. While the immediate attack appears to have subsided, it highlights a growing problem for independent websites facing aggressive data harvesting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the nature of the attack, the motivations behind aggressive scraping, and potential defensive measures. A central theme was the difficulty in distinguishing between a traditional DDoS attack and aggressive AI scraping; commenters noted that "sufficiently aggressive and inconsiderate scraping is indistinguishable from a DDoS attack." While the original poster attributed the attack to AI scrapers, some users questioned this, pointing out that malicious DDoS attacks are common and the two can easily be confused.

Participants debated the incentives driving these scrapers. There was skepticism that major AI labs were responsible, as the reputational damage and risk of blocking might outweigh the benefits of faster data collection. Instead, speculation turned to smaller, less scrupulous companies or even state actors, with one user noting they had seen over a million unique IPs hitting a Git server for scraping. A recurring cynical theory was that these attacks represent "intellectual property laundering," where companies scrape open-source content to resell as AI training data while bypassing licensing requirements.

Technical defenses were also discussed, though with mixed reactions. One user suggested using JavaScript tricks or Shadow DOMs to break scrapers, but others countered that this is a "fun idea" with limited real-world effectiveness and risks breaking legitimate tools like search engines and automated testing. Ultimately, the consensus was that the ecosystem is struggling to adapt to the scale and aggression of modern web scraping.

## [Map To Poster – Create Art of your favourite city](https://github.com/originalankur/maptoposter)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46656834

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Map To Poster," a Python tool that generates artistic posters of city maps. The tool uses OpenStreetMap data and Matplotlib to create customizable visualizations of urban road networks, allowing users to specify cities, themes (e.g., "sunset"), and distances to focus the map. It is designed for creating printable art from geographic data.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with users praising the tool's aesthetic output and the quality of the project's README. The discussion focused on technical usage, specific visual anomalies, and feature requests.

Several users encountered practical issues while using the script. One user questioned why large sections of San Francisco (specifically the Presidio parklands) were missing from an example, which the author clarified was due to the data filtering for roads. Another user reported that the data download step appeared stuck at 0%, though a commenter explained that the progress bar only updates after a full step completes, not incrementally. The author advised that using a smaller distance parameter (e.g., 10,000) yields faster results.

Technical enhancements were also debated. A user suggested exporting to SVG or PDF formats instead of PNG, which the author agreed to implement. However, a follow-up comment warned that exporting large cities to vector formats like PDF/SVG can be extremely slow due to file size. Other users pointed out visual bugs, such as the map of Venice appearing horizontally squeezed, which the author attributed to incorrect distance parameters for the city's shape.

Finally, the discussion included usage ideas and alternatives. One user expressed a desire to use the tool to create jigsaw puzzles for learning city layouts, while another noted the difficulty of navigating complex cities like Sydney. Several similar tools were recommended, including Prettymapp and City Roads, offering users other options for generating map art.

## [After 25 years, Wikipedia has proved that news doesn't need to look like news](https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/01/after-25-years-wikipedia-has-proved-that-news-doesnt-need-to-look-like-news/)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46656911

> **Article:** The article argues that Wikipedia, after 25 years, has fundamentally changed how we consume information, proving that "news" doesn't need to adhere to traditional journalistic formats. Instead of the inverted pyramid style of breaking news, Wikipedia offers a stable, cumulative, and collaboratively edited record of events. The author posits that this model—where information is constantly refined rather than being a disposable, time-sensitive product—is a more durable and useful way to document the world, effectively serving as a long-term, living archive rather than a fleeting news cycle.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely sidesteps the article's core thesis about information formats, instead focusing on Wikipedia's reliability, bias, and editorial processes. The conversation quickly fractures into several key themes:

A significant portion of the debate centers on Wikipedia's trustworthiness. One side argues it is heavily biased and easily manipulated, with users citing examples of agendas being pushed, such as alleged Qatar-backed edits or the "smearing" of dissenting doctors. The opposing view holds that while imperfect, Wikipedia is generally more reliable than many mainstream news outlets, with errors being corrected quickly due to high visibility.

The discussion also delves into specific editorial policies and their consequences. A prominent example is the removal of a deceased person's birth name (a "deadname") from their Wikipedia page, which some commenters saw as an erasure of historical fact in favor of a political stance. This sparked a sub-debate on the tension between documenting history and adhering to modern ethical standards.

Finally, users explored the practical utility and nature of Wikipedia. Some praised its value as a stable, long-term summary of events, contrasting it with the chaotic and ephemeral nature of traditional news. Others critiqued its effectiveness as a learning resource, particularly for complex topics like mathematics, and pointed to its systemic biases (e.g., being dominated by American perspectives). The conversation also touched on broader ideas about media consumption, with one thread debating the merits of a single, trusted source like the BBC versus a competitive, multi-source environment where bias is more overt.

## [ClickHouse acquires Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/blog/joining-clickhouse)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46656552

> **Article:** ClickHouse, a high-performance analytical database, has acquired Langfuse, an open-source LLM observability platform. The acquisition is part of ClickHouse's broader strategy to expand its capabilities in the AI and LLM space, specifically entering the LLM observability market. Langfuse will continue to operate as an open-source project, with the team joining ClickHouse to integrate deeper capabilities and enhance the platform's utility for LLM engineering.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the strategic rationale behind the acquisition, the financial implications for Langfuse, and the practical utility of LLM observability tools.

Users debated the strategic motivation, concluding that ClickHouse likely acquired Langfuse to enter the lucrative LLM observability market. Commenters noted that Langfuse had already built a popular wrapper around ClickHouse for this purpose, making the acquisition a logical step to capture that value directly. There was also speculation that this move was driven by VC pressure, suggesting that simply being a "time-series database" is no longer sufficient for high-growth valuations.

The financial aspect sparked debate regarding whether this was a successful exit or a "fire sale." Some users congratulated the team, while others speculated that Langfuse's seed funding from 2023 was likely depleted, implying the acquisition price might have been lower than hoped due to the difficult fundraising environment.

On the product side, users discussed the value of "Prompt Management" features found in tools like Langfuse. While some questioned their utility, others explained that A/B testing prompts on production data is essential for iterating on LLM agents. However, one user expressed skepticism about Langfuse's quality, citing bugs and confusing documentation, while another user humorously suggested ClickHouse might finally fix the documentation issues.

Finally, there was broader speculation about the trend of acquisitions in the AI tooling space, with some users predicting similar moves for other open-source projects like Pydantic.

## [Releasing rainbow tables to accelerate Net-NTLMv1 protocol deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/net-ntlmv1-deprecation-rainbow-tables)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46652617

> **Article:** Google's threat intelligence team has released a set of free, publicly available rainbow tables to accelerate the deprecation of the Net-NTLMv1 authentication protocol. The article explains that Net-NTLMv1 is a legacy protocol from 1987 that is highly vulnerable to offline cracking due to its weak cryptographic design. By providing these tables, which can crack Net-NTLMv1 hashes in under 12 hours on consumer-grade hardware, Google aims to give security teams the tools to prove the protocol's insecurity and push for its retirement within their organizations. The release is positioned as a proactive measure to encourage migration to more secure alternatives like Net-NTLMv2 or Kerberos.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive but contains several distinct themes. Many commenters express shock and disbelief that such an outdated and insecure protocol is still in use in 2026, viewing the release as a necessary, if overdue, push for modernization. A key point of debate is the motivation behind the release. Some speculate it's a marketing tactic for Mandiant, Google's incident response division, to generate business by highlighting widespread vulnerabilities. However, others counter that this is a legitimate security effort, providing IT administrators with the concrete evidence needed to justify security upgrades to management.

There is also a technical critique of the release format, with some users finding it lazy that Google is distributing the tables as large, raw data blobs rather than through a more user-friendly interface. The conversation touches on the history of such tools, with several users noting that similar rainbow tables have been available for decades, though often at a cost. The consensus is that while this empowers attackers, the real value is in forcing organizations that have long ignored the problem to finally address this critical security flaw.

## [Ask HN: Is it still worth pursuing a software startup?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46654726)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46654726

> **Question:** The user asks the Hacker News community whether it is still worth pursuing a software startup in the current technological and economic landscape. The question implies concerns about market saturation, the impact of AI on software development, and the viability of new ventures.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion presents a multifaceted view on the viability of software startups, centering on three main themes: the role of AI, the nature of business value, and market realities.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the impact of AI. Some commenters argue that AI lowers the barrier to entry, leading to an explosion of simple applications but rendering basic "toy" apps unsaleable. They contend that true value will shift to complex, fully engineered solutions that AI cannot easily replicate. Conversely, others express concern that AI tools like Claude Code will automate coding jobs and disrupt the entire computer-based employment landscape within a year, suggesting a very short window for profitability. However, a counterpoint was raised that while AI will eventually change everything, the slow-moving nature of bureaucratic and enterprise processes will delay this disruption significantly.

Regarding business fundamentals, commenters diverged on what makes a startup successful. One perspective emphasized that startups exist to solve human problems, and as long as humans have challenges, software remains a vital tool. Another user provided a real-world example of enterprise sales, noting that even customers capable of building their own AI tools often prefer paying for reliable, maintained software that requires no effort on their part. A more cynical view argued that most startups are motivated primarily by founders' desire for wealth rather than noble problem-solving, with many acting as agile sub-organizations designed specifically to be acquired by larger, slower companies.

Finally, the discussion touched on practical market considerations. While some warned that "hot" fields like AI create intense competition for talent and funding, others noted that remote work has equalized the playing field geographically. The consensus on execution was that it is the key differentiator; a great business doesn't necessarily need a "moat" or venture capital backing to provide a nice life for its founders, though competition is a healthy indicator of a viable market.

## [2025 was the third hottest year on record](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2026/01/14/2025-was-the-third-hottest-year-on-record)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46659913

> **Article:** The article reports that 2025 was the third hottest year on record, continuing the trend of rising global temperatures. It likely discusses the scientific data behind this finding and the implications for climate change targets, such as the 1.5°C warming limit.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of data verification, skepticism about political solutions, and debate over the feasibility of addressing climate change. A key point of contention was the article's scope, with some commenters clarifying that the "record" refers to data since 1880, not just the satellite era, and others criticizing the "third hottest year" framing as potentially misleading.

The conversation quickly pivoted to solutions and political will. Many users expressed cynicism about global coordination, arguing that historical precedent shows humanity struggles to respond to slow-moving threats. The concept of "carbon neutral by 2050" was heavily criticized as a vague, distant goal that enables inaction, with some suggesting tipping points have already been passed. A more optimistic viewpoint highlighted significant progress in renewable energy deployment, particularly in China and Europe, suggesting that technological advancement and economic competition, rather than political treaties, are the most realistic paths to decarbonization. Finally, a few users pointed to the raw climate data being publicly available, emphasizing the scientific consensus.

## [You have three minutes to escape the perpetual underclass](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2026/01/17/three-minutes.html)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 46656256

> **Article:** The article, titled "You have three minutes to escape the perpetual underclass," argues that humanity is on the verge of a technological singularity where Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and subsequent Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) will render human labor entirely obsolete. The author posits that this will create a permanent "underclass" of humans with no economic or political power, as their labor will have zero value. The central, provocative claim is that the only way to prevent this dystopian future is for skilled individuals in tech to refuse to participate in building these systems. The author frames this as a collective action problem, stating, "If you participate, we all lose," and suggests that by working for large tech companies, engineers are actively enabling the creation of their own obsolescence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the article's premise, tone, and proposed solution. A dominant theme is the hypocrisy of the author, who is identified as George Hotz, known for his work at major tech firms like Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Many commenters argue that it is disingenuous for someone who has profited from the "neofeudal lords" to now preach against working for them, with one user noting the pattern of successful tech workers suddenly developing a moral compass after securing their own financial stability.

Economically, the article's premise is challenged by several users who invoke the "lump of labor fallacy." They argue that labor is not a fixed quantity to be eliminated by technology; instead, as automation increases productivity, human work reconstitutes itself around new, scarce, and valuable tasks. While some concede this may not hold for all individuals (e.g., those with disabilities), the general consensus is that AI will transform, not eliminate, the need for human labor in the near to medium term. The practicality of the author's proposed solution—mass non-participation—is also questioned, with commenters framing it as a classic prisoner's dilemma where individual incentives would prevent collective action.

Finally, the discussion explores alternative dystopian scenarios. Some argue that the real threat isn't economic obsolescence but the military application of AI and robotics, which could eliminate the need for large armies and thus remove the political power of the masses. Others suggest that in a world of total automation, the owners of capital would have no need for a consumer class, as they could produce everything they require internally, making the "who will buy the goods?" argument moot. The overall sentiment is that while the concerns about AI's impact are valid, the article's argument is simplistic, economically incoherent, and hypocritical.

**Score:** 126 | **Comments:** 37 | **ID:** 46658213

> **Article:** The article, titled "Dispatch from the Occupation," describes a state of heightened federal law enforcement activity in Minneapolis. The author portrays the city as being under an "occupation" by thousands of ICE agents and other federal forces. The piece details aggressive enforcement actions, including raids, arrests of activists and immigrants, and the use of chemical crowd deterrents. It conveys a sense of fear and disruption within the community, suggesting that residents, particularly immigrants, are afraid to leave their homes or send their children to school due to the presence of masked, militarized agents. The author frames these events as a significant and alarming escalation in federal policing tactics.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was highly polarized and contentious, centering on the appropriateness of the topic for the platform and the credibility of the article's claims.

A primary theme was the debate over whether this political topic belongs on Hacker News. Several users argued for its relevance, connecting it to technology by pointing out that companies like Palantir provide the technological infrastructure for ICE's operations. They contended that significant political events impacting society are a valid subject for discussion. Conversely, other users felt the topic was outside the site's scope, with some suggesting it was deliberately flagged and removed from the front page, creating a "blind spot" in the community.

The credibility of the article's claims was another major point of contention. Some commenters expressed skepticism, questioning the author's motives and the potential for exaggeration, and highlighting the difficulty of discerning truth in a polarized media environment. Others defended the report's validity, citing corroborating evidence from mainstream news outlets, government announcements, and firsthand accounts from local residents. Several commenters from the Minneapolis area offered conflicting personal anecdotes, with some validating the article's depiction of a fearful atmosphere while others stated they had not observed such widespread concern.

Finally, the discussion escalated to broader political predictions and anxieties. Users debated the effectiveness and public support for ICE, with some framing the agency's actions as a precursor to more authoritarian measures, such as the potential cancellation of elections or the invocation of the Insurrection Act. The conversation reflected a deep sense of division, with some participants viewing the situation as a critical historical turning point and others expressing a sense of helplessness or dismissal.

> **Article:** The article is a technical walkthrough of reverse-engineering a drone's firmware. The author details the process of physically accessing the drone's circuit board, identifying the flash memory chip, and using hardware tools (like a Bus Pirate) to dump the firmware. The core of the article focuses on analyzing the dumped firmware to understand its structure and, specifically, how it uses Error Correction Codes (ECC). The author explains the theory behind the ECC algorithm used and demonstrates a practical method to "brute-force" the ECC parameters by intentionally corrupting data and observing the correction behavior, ultimately succeeding in validating their understanding by patching and re-uploading a modified firmware file.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters praising the article as a beautiful, detailed, and inspiring write-up that makes hands-on electronics and reverse engineering more accessible. Several key themes emerged:

*   **Clarification and Appreciation:** A user clarified that "ECC" in the title refers to Error Correction Codes, not Elliptic Curve Cryptography, highlighting the technical nature of the content. The general sentiment was one of gratitude for the author's effort in documenting the process.
*   **Practical Applications and Future Projects:** Users expressed interest in seeing similar reverse-engineering efforts applied to other devices, such as DJI drones and DRM-protected Bosch e-bike motors. The e-bike topic sparked a brief sub-discussion, with one user cautioning against it due to concerns about theft and illegal speed modifications, while another argued for the importance of open-source principles.
*   **Legal and Licensing Issues:** A recurring point was the observation that many embedded devices use Linux without providing the required GPL source code. Commenters debated the practicalities and risks of enforcing GPL compliance, with some noting the difficulty of finding violators and others lamenting the lack of a dedicated legal fund to pursue such cases.
*   **Technical and Methodological Notes:** A few comments touched on technical details, such as the performance of the Python script used for brute-forcing (with suggestions to use C++ for speed) and a minor typo in the article's explanation of parity. One commenter also related the author's experimental approach ("an hour of experimenting can save 5 minutes of reading") to software development methodologies like TDD versus deep analysis.

## [The 'untouchable hacker god' behind Finland's biggest crime](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/17/vastaamo-hack-finland-therapy-notes)
**Score:** 121 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46656045

> **Article:** The Guardian article details the 2020 Vastaamo therapy clinic hack in Finland, one of the country's worst privacy breaches. The perpetrator, known as "Julius," accessed over 30,000 patient therapy notes due to shockingly poor security: the database was internet-accessible with a blank password. Julius then engaged in extortion, demanding Bitcoin payments from both the clinic and individual patients to prevent the release of their sensitive data. The article describes Julius as an "untouchable hacker god" who operated with impunity, even taunting authorities. The breach had devastating consequences for victims, leading to public shaming and suicides. While the hacker was eventually caught and sentenced to over six years in prison, the article notes his lack of remorse and the recent overturning of the clinic CEO's criminal negligence conviction, highlighting ongoing failures in accountability and data protection.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on three main themes: the appalling negligence of the clinic, the hacker's character and punishment, and the broader legal implications for cybersecurity.

A significant portion of the comments express outrage at Vastaamo's security failures. Users highlight that the database was not only accessible via the internet but was also secured with a blank password. There is a strong consensus that the company's leadership, including the CEO, should face severe criminal consequences for this negligence, with some noting that the CEO's initial conviction was recently overturned on appeal.

Commenters are also highly critical of the hacker, Julius. They describe him as a "disgusting human being" who shows no remorse and is likely to re-offend. There is a sense that his six-year sentence is insufficient, with some suggesting he should face "draconian" punishment or that justice might be served outside the legal system. The discussion also touches on his operational security (opsec), with some users finding it "shocking" that he was caught, while others caution against blindly accepting the prosecution's narrative.

Finally, the discussion broadens to the legal landscape for security researchers, particularly in Europe. A German commenter points out that even ethical hacking is legally perilous, as accessing a system with a publicly available (even if blank) password can be considered a criminal offense under "hacker paragraph" laws. This creates a chilling effect, where skilled researchers may avoid reporting critical vulnerabilities for fear of prosecution, ultimately leaving systems exposed to malicious actors.

## [The recurring dream of replacing developers](https://www.caimito.net/en/blog/2025/12/07/the-recurring-dream-of-replacing-developers.html)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46658345

> **Article:** The article "The recurring dream of replacing developers" argues that the idea of automating software development is a cyclical, recurring fantasy rather than a new phenomenon. It posits that this dream is driven more by business desires to reduce costs and by a cultural animosity towards developers (the "jocks vs. nerds" dynamic) than by the actual capabilities of the technology. The author suggests that while new tools like AI increase abstraction and productivity, they do not eliminate the need for human judgment, problem-solving, and the fundamental understanding of how to instruct a computer. The core of the piece is a critique of the hype cycle, asserting that the promise of replacing developers is often a marketing ploy to attract investment rather than a reflection of technical reality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the economic, historical, and psychological drivers behind the "replace the developer" narrative. A central theme is that the desire to automate development is fundamentally about cost reduction and the fantasy of effortless wealth. One commenter argues that leaders hope AI will allow them to "run companies" by simply owning shares and providing prompts, without needing to understand the underlying work, likening it to a "get-rich-quick scheme."

Another major thread examines the historical context, comparing the current AI hype to past technological shifts. The spreadsheet is a key example: while it automated certain tasks previously done by programmers, it simultaneously created a massive new field of work and, as one user argued, ultimately increased the demand for developers to build and maintain the data systems that feed these tools. This leads to the consensus that technology increases abstraction rather than eliminating roles. The discussion draws a parallel to the evolution from machine code to high-level languages, where each step freed developers from lower-level concerns to tackle more complex problems. However, a crucial distinction is made: previous abstractions were deterministic and verifiable, whereas generative AI is not, which introduces a new level of uncertainty.

Psychologically, several commenters echo the article's sentiment that the push for AI replacement stems from a cultural dislike of developers, framing them as messengers of reality who are blamed for project constraints. There's a palpable sense of skepticism towards the marketing, with users noting that companies focus on discrediting "naysayers" rather than delivering on their ambitious promises. The conversation also touches on the cyclical nature of these claims, with one user coining the phrase "Mythical Man Month -> Mythical AI Agent Swarm" to capture the repetition of flawed management thinking. Ultimately, the discussion concludes that while AI will undoubtedly change the nature of development, the core need for skilled individuals who can effectively "talk to computers" and solve complex problems will persist, even if the job title evolves.

## [Show HN: Streaming gigabyte medical images from S3 without downloading them](https://github.com/PABannier/WSIStreamer)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46656358

> **Project:** The project is WSIStreamer, a tool designed to stream large Whole Slide Images (WSI) from cloud storage like AWS S3 directly to a web viewer without requiring the user to download the entire multi-gigabyte file. It addresses the challenge of viewing massive medical images (often 500k x 500k pixels) by fetching only the necessary tiles on demand. The tool is particularly relevant for cloud-based workflows where traditional file-system access (required by libraries like OpenSlide) is unavailable, and it currently supports vendor-specific formats like TIFF and SVS with JPEG/JPEG2000 compression.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the project's technical parallels with other fields, its specific use case in digital pathology, and alternative technologies. Several users noted that the problem is conceptually similar to serving geospatial data, such as satellite maps or protomaps, suggesting that the project could potentially be adapted to work with frontend map libraries like Leaflet. The necessity of the tool was debated; while some pointed out that on-premise solutions can use existing libraries like OpenSlide with local files, the creator clarified that WSIStreamer is specifically for storage systems lacking a filesystem interface.

Alternative technologies were proposed, including JPEG-XL for partial decoding and IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) for standardizing image access, though the creator emphasized the requirement to work directly with proprietary vendor formats (like .svs) common in datasets such as TCGA to preserve metadata. There was also a minor semantic debate about the term "streaming" versus "downloading portions," and a practical note on supporting cloud platforms beyond AWS S3.

## [Eight European countries face 10% tariff for opposing US control of Greenland](https://apnews.com/article/denmark-greenland-us-trump-4ad99ea3975a8b62d37bd04961feda55)
**Score:** 110 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46659651

> **Article:** An AP News article reports that the Trump administration is threatening to impose a 10% tariff on eight European countries, including the UK and Denmark, in retaliation for their opposition to the US gaining control of Greenland. The move is presented as an escalation of the administration's pressure campaign regarding the strategic Arctic territory.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the US administration's actions, viewing the tariff threat as an aggressive and irrational escalation that damages international alliances. The sentiment is characterized by alarm, cynicism, and a sense of a fundamental shift in the US's global role.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Damage to Alliances and US Standing:** Commenters express shock at the pressure being placed on NATO allies, with many suggesting the US is transforming from a reliable partner into a coercive, unpredictable actor. The move is seen as undermining diplomatic norms and potentially weakening the NATO alliance.
*   **Criticism of the Trump Administration:** The discussion is heavily focused on President Trump, with commenters describing his motivations as a personal "hyperfixation" and an attempt to "cement his legacy." There is widespread condemnation of Republican politicians for enabling the administration's policies, with one user describing them as having "kissed the ring."
*   **Calls for European Retaliation:** A prominent theme is the expectation that the EU must respond firmly. Some commenters advocate for the implementation of a Digital Services Tax (DST) as a retaliatory measure, arguing that it's a necessary economic tool for European sovereignty. There is a debate over whether the EU has the "spine" to stand up to the US.
*   **Historical Parallels and Fears:** The rhetoric is often dire, with users drawing parallels to historical fascism, specifically referencing the German invasion of Poland. There is speculation about the US targeting other nations like Venezuela after Greenland, framing the administration's actions as part of a larger, expansionist agenda.
*   **Underlying Motivations:** While the official reason is Greenland, commenters are skeptical. Some suggest the tariff threat is a distraction from other scandals, such as the Jeffrey Epstein case, while others see it as a symptom of a deeper, more systemic issue with US foreign policy that has existed long before the current administration.

## [Justice Dept. launches criminal investigation of Minnesota governor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/16/trump-minnesota-walz-frey-criminal-investigation/)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 55 | **ID:** 46654721

> **Article:** The Washington Post article reports that the U.S. Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The investigation centers on whether their public statements criticizing federal law enforcement actions and immigration raids constitute criminal interference with federal investigations. The probe is reportedly examining if their rhetoric impeded the work of federal officers, particularly regarding ICE operations in the state.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the Justice Department's actions, framing the investigation as politically motivated and an abuse of power. The dominant sentiment is that this represents a dangerous escalation by the Trump administration to weaponize the DOJ against political opponents and suppress dissent.

Key themes in the comments include:
*   **Political Weaponization:** Many commenters view the investigation as a clear example of the administration using federal power to target officials who oppose its policies. Several users explicitly accuse the administration of projection, noting that Trump frequently accused Democrats of weaponizing the DOJ while now doing so himself.
*   **Free Speech Concerns:** A central point of contention is the legal basis of the investigation. Commenters argue that criticizing federal actions is protected speech and that the DOJ's premise—that public statements can constitute criminal interference—is a direct assault on the First Amendment.
*   **Authoritarian Overreach:** The discussion frequently uses strong language to describe the administration's tactics, with terms like "boot stomping," "authoritarian," and "Stalinist" appearing. Users express concern that this is a step toward invoking the Insurrection Act and consolidating power.
*   **International Standing:** One commenter broadens the scope, linking the domestic political turmoil to a decline in the U.S.'s global reputation, citing a Canadian official who described China as more "predictable" than the U.S. as a partner.
*   **Local Impact:** A user from Minnesota shares a personal perspective, noting that the climate of fear created by federal immigration raids is causing real distress among residents, and expresses support for Walz and Frey's stance.

Overall, the discussion portrays the investigation not as a legitimate legal inquiry but as a politically motivated attack designed to intimidate political opponents and undermine democratic norms.
