# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-15

## [FBI raids Washington Post reporter's home](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/fbi-raid-washington-post-hannah-natanson)
**Score:** 852 | **Comments:** 537 | **ID:** 46616745

> **Article:** The Guardian reports that the FBI raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson as part of an inquiry into classified materials. The article notes that reporters are rarely subjected to such raids in the US. Natanson recently published a feature detailing her work interviewing over 1,000 current and former federal employees about the impact of recent political changes on their careers and mental health. The raid is viewed as a potential escalation in the government's efforts to identify and prosecute sources leaking information about internal government turmoil.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the FBI's actions, viewing the raid as a significant escalation against the free press and a symptom of broader authoritarian trends in the US government.

**Concerns for Sources and Civil Liberties**
The most immediate concern for commenters was the safety of Natanson's sources. Users speculated that the FBI would use the raid to seize her devices and crack them to obtain the names of the 1,169 federal employees who spoke to her, potentially charging them with treason. There was a strong consensus that the justification of "classified materials" is a dangerous tool that allows the government to target journalists without transparency, as the evidence remains secret.

**Political Context and "Boiling the Frog"**
Many users placed the raid within a larger political context, describing it as a continuation of executive overreach that has expanded through multiple administrations (Bush, Obama, Trump), rather than a partisan issue unique to one leader. The "boiling frog" analogy was frequently used to describe how citizens are passively accepting escalating authoritarian measures. Some referenced the TV show *Andor* to illustrate the idea that regimes often intentionally provoke harsh crackdowns to radicalize the populace and fuel a rebellion.

**Hypocrisy and Selective Enforcement**
Commenters noted the perceived hypocrisy in the government's aggressive pursuit of leaks regarding its own internal functions, contrasting it with the handling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. A recurring point was the accusation that "free speech" advocates and "patriots" who champion the Second Amendment are silent or even supportive when the First Amendment is threatened, particularly when the targets are perceived as political opponents.

**The Nature of the Reporting**
Users distinguished Natanson's work from major whistleblower cases like Edward Snowden. They characterized her reporting not as a single bombshell exposing a secret program, but as an aggregation of "a thousand small cuts"—documenting the human cost and systemic dysfunction within the federal government. This perspective suggests the government's motivation is to suppress the narrative of internal collapse and dissent rather than to protect a specific intelligence secret.

## [I hate GitHub Actions with passion](https://xlii.space/eng/i-hate-github-actions-with-passion/)
**Score:** 390 | **Comments:** 289 | **ID:** 46614558

> **Article:** The article, titled "I hate GitHub Actions with passion," is a rant about the difficulties of debugging and fixing GitHub Actions workflows. The author expresses frustration with the lack of visibility into runner environments, especially when a workflow fails on a specific platform (e.g., Linux ARM) while working on others. The core problem described is a dependency installation step that worked locally but failed unpredictably in the CI environment. The author's main conclusion is a strong piece of advice: developers should not embed complex logic within GitHub Actions workflow files. Instead, they should keep all scripts and logic in their own repository (e.g., as shell scripts, Makefiles, or other build scripts) and use GitHub Actions merely as a simple wrapper to execute those scripts, making the CI process more predictable and easier to debug.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's frustrations and centers on strategies for making CI/CD pipelines more robust and debuggable. A recurring theme is the best practice of keeping logic out of CI configuration files. Many commenters agree that workflows should be simple "dumb" orchestrators that call external, version-controlled scripts which can be tested locally, thus avoiding vendor lock-in and simplifying debugging.

The conversation then shifts to practical solutions for the core problem of debugging failures in a remote, opaque environment. The most popular suggestions are tools that provide direct SSH access to a failed runner. Commenters recommend `action-tmate` or its modern alternative `action-upterm` to get an interactive shell for live debugging. Another tool mentioned is `act`, which aims to run Actions locally, but several users caution that it's not a perfect drop-in replacement and can fail to replicate the exact CI environment, especially for complex workflows.

Finally, some commenters debate the root cause, suggesting the issue is less about GitHub Actions itself and more about dependency management. They argue that using tools like Nix or Mise to ensure identical tooling versions between local and CI environments would prevent such problems from occurring in the first place.

## [Ford F-150 Lightning outsold the Cybertruck and was then canceled for poor sales](https://electrek.co/2026/01/13/ford-f150-lightning-outsold-tesla-cybertruck-canceled-not-selling-enough/)
**Score:** 377 | **Comments:** 516 | **ID:** 46618901

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports that Ford has discontinued its F-150 Lightning EV, despite it outselling the Tesla Cybertruck. The stated reason for the cancellation is "poor sales," which the article frames as a paradox. It argues that while the Lightning sold a respectable number of units (around 27,300 in the US), Ford's massive scale and production capacity required higher volumes to be considered a success. The piece contrasts this with the Cybertruck, which it portrays as an "abject failure" plagued by recalls, production issues, and a recent 99% reduction in a major battery supplier's contract. The article suggests the Lightning was a better-designed and more practical vehicle, but was ultimately undermined by Ford's pricing and production strategy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with users debating the reasons behind the F-150 Lightning's discontinuation and the relative success or failure of both it and the Cybertruck.

A central theme is the difference in sales expectations between a legacy automaker like Ford and a niche player like Tesla. Several users point out that for a company of Ford's size, the Lightning's sales figures were insufficient to justify its production line, whereas the Cybertruck's lower sales are acceptable given its high price point and niche market. The role of dealerships in potentially sabotaging EV sales through markups and misinformation was also frequently cited.

The conversation about the Cybertruck was highly polarized. Critics labeled it an "abject failure," citing its numerous recalls, insurance difficulties, and impractical design. Some also attributed its poor sales to its strong association with Elon Musk's political activities, which alienated the pro-EV demographic. However, a few commenters offered a more nuanced view, admiring Tesla's willingness to take a design risk in a market of homogenous-looking trucks.

Several alternative vehicles were brought up. The Slate EV was mentioned by multiple users as a more desirable "spiritual successor to the OG Jeep," though others were skeptical of its viability as a new startup. The Toyota hybrid-first strategy was praised as a prudent alternative to the "all-in" EV approach of other legacy automakers. Finally, a few current F-150 Lightning owners chimed in to praise the vehicle's quality and utility, expressing disappointment at its cancellation.

## [Ask HN: Share your personal website](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46618714)
**Score:** 354 | **Comments:** 1165 | **ID:** 46618714

> **Question:** A user posted an "Ask HN" question inviting community members to share the URLs of their personal websites. The post is intentionally minimal, with no additional text or restrictions, welcoming any type of personal website (not just blogs).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly evolved from a simple sharing thread into a community-driven project. A user named "susam" took the initiative to create a centralized, public directory of all the shared websites on GitHub Pages, providing a link to the directory and a separate README explaining the project. This prompted other users to contribute their links, which susam then systematically added to the directory, even linking to the specific GitHub commit for transparency. Other users engaged with this initiative, with some offering to help import links from a similar, older Ask HN thread and others simply sharing their sites. The overall tone was collaborative and enthusiastic, with participants appreciating the creation of a persistent, organized resource rather than just a temporary discussion thread.

## [SparkFun Officially Dropping AdaFruit due to CoC Violation](https://www.sparkfun.com/official-response)
**Score:** 347 | **Comments:** 352 | **ID:** 46616488

> **Article:** SparkFun, an electronics distributor, announced it is officially dropping AdaFruit as a partner due to a Code of Conduct (CoC) violation. The announcement, made on SparkFun's website, is vague on specifics but alleges that AdaFruit engaged in "offensive, antagonistic, and derogatory emails," involved a SparkFun customer in a private matter, and violated a non-disparagement clause. The post states that SparkFun will no longer carry AdaFruit products and has also cut off access to a key product, the Teensy microcontroller board, which SparkFun recently became the exclusive manufacturer and distributor for.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by speculation and the emergence of conflicting narratives from both companies. The initial reaction was one of confusion due to SparkFun's vague public statement, with many commenters questioning the professionalism of airing grievances publicly. The discussion evolved significantly after AdaFruit's leadership, including Phil Torrone, responded in a forum thread.

The conversation now centers on two competing accounts of the dispute:

*   **SparkFun's Position (as inferred):** They are enforcing their CoC after what they perceive as antagonistic behavior from AdaFruit, framing it as a necessary action to protect their employees and customers.
*   **AdaFruit's Position:** They claim the CoC violation is a pretext. AdaFruit alleges that SparkFun's founder and a former employee have been engaged in a long-term harassment campaign against AdaFruit's founder, Limor Fried. AdaFruit states they reported this behavior to SparkFun, and in retaliation, SparkFun cut them off from the Teensy product line. AdaFruit's response is to announce an open-source alternative to the Teensy.

Key discussion points include:
*   **Criticism of SparkFun's Vagueness:** Many users found SparkFun's public post unprofessional and an "invitation for speculation."
*   **Support for AdaFruit's Counter-Narrative:** Several commenters linked to and summarized AdaFruit's response, which frames SparkFun as the aggressor and the CoC as a "smokescreen."
*   **Business Implications:** Users discussed the practical impact, particularly for European customers who rely on SparkFun distributors for AdaFruit products. The move is also seen as a catalyst for AdaFruit to develop an open-source alternative, aligning with their long-standing principles.
*   **Context on the Teensy:** A user provided background that SparkFun had recently become the exclusive manufacturer for the Teensy, which explains why this product is central to the dispute and why AdaFruit's proposed open-source alternative is a significant strategic response.

Overall, the community is piecing together a story that appears to be a bitter corporate and personal conflict, with the public "CoC violation" being just the latest chapter in a longer dispute.

## [1000 Blank White Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Blank_White_Cards)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46611823

> **Article:** The Wikipedia article describes "1000 Blank White Cards" (1KBWC) as a party game where players create the rules and cards as they play. The game uses a deck of blank cards and a pen. On a player's turn, they may draw a card (either from a pre-existing deck or a blank one) and either play an existing card's effect or create a new card by writing a rule or action on a blank card and adding it to the deck. The game is open-ended, creative, and often humorous, with no fixed ruleset and the game's structure evolving entirely based on player input.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the game's improvisational nature, its relationship to other games, and the social dynamics it creates. Users compared 1KBWC to games like "We Didn't Playtest This at All" and "Fluxx," noting that while they share a chaotic, rule-bending spirit, 1KBWC's true blank-slate nature is unique. The game was also frequently likened to "Calvinball" from the Calvin and Hobbes comics, with users debating the similarities and differences, such as 1KBWC's ability to reuse rules.

Several users shared personal experiences and variations. One popular thread detailed a drinking game called "Pizza Box," where players flip a coin into a pizza box and write rules in the circles they create, leading to a self-evolving rule set. Another user shared a long and fond memory of playing "Mao," a game where the winner of each round invents a new, secret rule that other players must deduce through trial and error.

The conversation also touched on the game's social and theoretical aspects. One user described the "metagame" of 1KBWC, where players collectively decide which user-created cards to keep for future games, leading to the organic development of complex card interactions and in-jokes over multiple sessions. The game was also framed as a form of "constitutional economics" or "mechanism design" in practice, highlighting its relevance to real-world systems with evolving rules.

## [Claude Cowork Exfiltrates Files](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/claude-cowork-exfiltrates-files)
**Score:** 335 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46622328

> **Article:** The article from PromptArmor details a security vulnerability in Anthropic's "Claude for Work" (Cowork) product that allows for data exfiltration. The attack vector is a prompt injection embedded within a seemingly benign file (e.g., a .docx with hidden text). A user, acting as an "attacker," uploads this file to Claude with a prompt asking the AI to analyze it for a specific skill. The hidden text instructs Claude to ignore its original task and instead exfiltrate the contents of files in its accessible directory to an external server controlled by the attacker. The article demonstrates that this is a critical flaw, as the AI can be manipulated to bypass its intended function and leak sensitive data, turning a productivity tool into a data theft instrument.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community grappling with the fundamental security challenges of AI agents. A central theme is the frustration with vendors like Anthropic, who are perceived as shifting the security burden onto users with "unreasonable precautions" rather than solving the core issue. The vulnerability itself is widely seen as an inherent and unsolvable problem of prompt injection, which some commenters equate to a new form of Remote Code Execution (RCE). While the specific attack's feasibility is debated—with some pointing out it requires tricking the user into uploading a malicious file and using an old model version—the underlying risk is considered universal.

There is significant skepticism about the effectiveness of current security measures like "sandboxes," with some arguing that containing a sophisticated, goal-oriented AI is intrinsically difficult. The discussion also explores practical mitigation strategies, such as using GitHub's secret scanning to automatically revoke exposed API keys. A notable historical parallel is drawn to early web security flaws like SQL injection, suggesting that the AI industry is in a similar "growing pains" phase where foundational security is still being figured out. The conversation concludes with a sense of inevitability that a major, multi-billion dollar data breach is likely on the horizon if these architectural flaws are not addressed.

## [ASCII Clouds](https://caidan.dev/portfolio/ascii_clouds/)
**Score:** 329 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46611507

> **Article:** The article links to a portfolio piece titled "ASCII Clouds" by caidan.dev. It showcases a real-time, interactive 3D visualization of volumetric clouds rendered in an ASCII art style. The effect is presented as a visually appealing, artistic piece that combines classic ASCII aesthetics with modern 3D graphics.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction was largely positive, with many commenters finding the visual effect "cool" and "pretty good." However, the discussion quickly evolved into a technical and philosophical one.

A key theme was the technical implementation. Several users pointed out that creating an ASCII post-processing shader is a well-established technique, providing links to existing examples and libraries for popular 3D frameworks like Three.js and Babylon.js. This perspective framed the project as a "technological show piece" rather than a novel invention, which left some users feeling they "didn't understand" its purpose.

Conversely, other users appreciated the aesthetic result and found it inspiring. One user expressed a desire to see it used as an audio visualizer, while another was excited about the potential for integrating a similar effect into their own work.

A minor debate emerged regarding the use of color. One commenter argued that using different colors and brightness for the ASCII symbols defeats the purpose of the style, which traditionally relies on character density to represent intensity. Another countered that as "ascii art," it falls under artistic license.

Finally, the discussion included a nostalgic element, with one user sharing their own C program from 2007 that produced a similar effect, and another sharing a creative "shadertoy" implementation that runs entirely within the Emacs text editor.

## [I’m leaving Redis for SolidQueue](https://www.simplethread.com/redis-solidqueue/)
**Score:** 291 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46614037

> **Article:** The article "I'm leaving Redis for SolidQueue" argues for migrating background job processing in Rails applications from Redis to SolidQueue, a new framework-integrated solution that uses the application's primary database (PostgreSQL or SQLite) as its backend. The author's primary motivation is operational simplification: eliminating the need to manage, monitor, and scale a separate Redis instance reduces complexity and infrastructure costs.

The post outlines the benefits, such as leveraging existing database expertise, backups, and transactional integrity (e.g., creating a job within the same transaction as the main business logic). It acknowledges potential downsides, like increased load on the primary database and the lack of advanced features like Redis's "Batches." However, the author concludes that for the vast majority of applications, the simplicity and reduced operational burden of a database-backed queue far outweigh the performance trade-offs, positioning SolidQueue as a pragmatic default for new Rails projects.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, focusing on the trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and operational architecture. The consensus is that for most applications, a database-backed queue is a perfectly sensible and increasingly popular choice.

A central theme is the tension between simplicity and scalability. Many commenters agree that eliminating a separate service like Redis is a major win for reducing operational overhead. However, the viability of this approach is questioned in high-throughput scenarios. One commenter shared a negative experience with a similar Postgres-based system (Graphile Worker) at ~5k jobs/minute, forcing a switch to Redis+BullMQ. This was countered by others who found such throughput levels to be a misconfiguration, and by pointing to benchmarks from Oban (an Elixir-based job queue) showing millions of jobs per minute.

The discussion also highlighted important architectural considerations:
*   **Separation of Concerns:** One user argued that the ideal architecture uses a lightweight, separate datastore (like Redis) for the job queue to avoid putting load on the production database, a problem SolidQueue doesn't solve.
*   **Database Portability:** A key criticism of SolidQueue is its design philosophy, which prioritizes universal SQL compatibility (for MySQL support) over leveraging PostgreSQL-specific features. This was seen as a drawback by some, who prefer systems like `good_job` that are optimized for Postgres's capabilities.
*   **Payload Size:** A practical limitation of DB-backed queues is identified: they are inefficient for large job payloads. The best practice is to pass IDs and fetch data within the worker, making Redis's in-memory speed less critical for most use cases.

Ultimately, the conversation frames the choice not as "Postgres vs. Redis," but as a decision based on specific needs. For the majority of apps, the simplicity of SolidQueue is a compelling advantage, while Redis remains the go-to for extreme performance requirements or advanced features.

## [So, you’ve hit an age gate. What now?](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/so-youve-hit-age-gate-what-now)
**Score:** 277 | **Comments:** 227 | **ID:** 46619030

> **Article:** This EFF article, titled "So, you've hit an age gate. What now?", provides practical advice for users encountering mandatory age verification prompts on websites. It frames these gates as a significant threat to privacy, as they force users to hand over sensitive personal information (like government IDs or facial scans) to private companies. The article outlines several strategies to bypass these checks, including using privacy tools like VPNs to appear from a different jurisdiction, employing ad-blockers to remove the gate overlays, and using throwaway or synthetic identities. It also discusses the unreliability of corporate "age estimation" technology and offers guidance on what to do if you are wrongly flagged as a minor.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community deeply skeptical of age verification laws, viewing them primarily as a pretext for increased corporate and government surveillance rather than a genuine child safety measure. A central theme is the search for effective workarounds. Users suggest technical solutions like VPNs and ad-blockers, but there's debate over their long-term effectiveness as sites harden their verification systems. The conversation also explores the use of "throwaway" or synthetic identities, with users noting that the prevalence of data leaks makes this a viable, if legally gray, option.

There is widespread distrust of the companies implementing these checks, particularly Google, with many commenters believing the true motive is data collection ("they just want your face") rather than age verification. The discussion highlights the real-world consequences and absurdities of these systems, such as privacy-conscious children being forced to learn bad habits (uploading stock photos) to bypass checks, and the potential for these systems to be easily fooled. Ultimately, the comments reflect a strong opposition to the normalization of handing over biometric data to corporations, which many see as a dangerous erosion of online privacy and freedom.

## [The $LANG Programming Language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46610557)
**Score:** 258 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46610557

> **Article:** The article is not a traditional article but a dynamic HN page generated by admin "dang" to list all posts on Hacker News that are about a new programming language. The page is titled "The $LANG Programming Language" as a placeholder, and the URL is `/showlang`. It serves as a curated index for "Show HN" submissions related to programming languages, which are otherwise hard to find in the new submissions stream.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around the mechanics and visibility of the new `/showlang` page. The admin, dang, explains that the page is a manually curated list of posts that fit the "Show HN: [Language Name]" convention, and notes that the implementation was inefficient, causing a temporary performance hit to the site. Users report that their own language submissions (e.g., Tsonic, MoonBit) failed to appear on the list automatically due to title formatting or software glitches, prompting dang to manually add them and offer advice on how to get posts featured.

There is also a mix of humor and confusion regarding the placeholder title "$LANG". Several users joke about creating a language with that literal name or misinterpreted it as an environment variable, while others discuss the challenges of discovering new languages on HN and share their own language design ideas.

## [The Gleam Programming Language](https://gleam.run/)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46611667

> **Article:** The article introduces Gleam, a statically typed functional programming language that compiles to both Erlang (for the BEAM/OTP ecosystem) and JavaScript. It emphasizes simplicity, a strong type system, and a good developer experience, aiming to bring the safety and guarantees of static typing to the concurrent, fault-tolerant world of Erlang and the ubiquitous world of JavaScript.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a nuanced view of Gleam, balancing its technical strengths against practical adoption hurdles. The overall sentiment is cautiously positive, with developers intrigued by its promise of type safety on the BEAM but concerned about ecosystem maturity and practical friction.

Key themes from the discussion include:

*   **The Value of Type Safety on the BEAM:** A central debate is whether a static type system is beneficial for distributed systems. One commenter argued that types are less useful for network applications where data is just bits and uncertainty is high. This was strongly countered by others who asserted that types are precisely the tool needed to formally define and verify communication protocols and data structures, preventing errors at the point of ingress.

*   **Ecosystem and Interoperability:** There was significant discussion around Gleam's relationship with the existing Erlang/Elixir ecosystem. While one user concluded that Gleam's lack of access to these libraries was a deal-breaker, others quickly corrected this, demonstrating that Gleam can call Erlang/Elixir code directly using `@external` annotations. However, the lack of standard library support for platform-specific features (like filesystem access) and the need for manual serialization for many types were cited as real-world friction points.

*   **Dual Compilation Target:** The ability to compile to both Erlang and JavaScript is seen as a major feature, enabling full-stack applications with shared code. However, concerns were raised about potential pitfalls, such as behavioral differences (e.g., `Int` being arbitrary-precision on Erlang but a 64-bit float in JavaScript) and the philosophical question of whether a language can excel at two very different targets.

*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Developers compared Gleam to other languages. Some felt that Erlang's "let it crash" philosophy with pattern matching was sufficient, while others saw Gleam as a path toward the type safety and ergonomics of Rust. The lack of features like ad-hoc polymorphism (protocols) and macros, common in Elixir, was a specific point of friction for some coming from that ecosystem.

*   **Developer Experience:** On the positive side, several users praised Gleam for its elegant syntax, simplicity, and the joy it brings back to programming, especially for those feeling burnt out. It was described as more approachable than Erlang for those new to functional programming on the BEAM.

## [Roam 50GB is now Roam 100GB](https://starlink.com/support/article/58c9c8b7-474e-246f-7e3c-06db3221d34d)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 254 | **ID:** 46617668

> **Article:** Starlink has updated its Roam mobile plan, doubling the monthly data allowance from 50GB to 100GB for the same price of $150/month. The plan is designed for users traveling outside their home service area. Once the 100GB of high-speed data is consumed, the connection is not cut off but is instead throttled to a slower speed of approximately 500 kbps. This "unlimited slow speeds" model is a key feature of the offering.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction was largely positive, with several distinct themes emerging.

A central point of praise was the "soft cap" policy. Many commenters expressed a strong preference for throttling over a complete service cutoff, noting that a speed of 500 kbps is still perfectly usable for essential tasks like email, notifications, web browsing, and even video conferencing. Several users shared personal anecdotes of using similar slow-speed plans as a reliable and cost-effective backup for primary internet connections.

The discussion also highlighted the plan's value proposition. While some users lamented the loss of the previous pay-as-you-go option for overages, most agreed that doubling the data allowance for the same price is a significant improvement. The plan was seen as a practical solution for travelers, RVers, and those in rural areas with poor cellular service.

However, the conversation was not without contention. A brief but heated sub-thread devolved into a political debate, with one user refusing to support the company due to its association with Elon Musk, while others defended him for his role in providing internet access to censored regions like Iran.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader industry trends. One commenter proposed a business idea for a new type of mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) based on this throttled-speed model, suggesting Starlink is uniquely positioned to bypass the restrictions that prevent traditional carriers from offering such a service.

## [Verizon outages reported across U.S.](https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/nation-world/verizon-outage-reported/507-ef3cb3d0-f595-432f-9f84-d1690a5085a7)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46620835

> **Article:** The article from First Coast News reports on widespread Verizon outages being experienced by customers across the United States. The report is based on user complaints and data from outage tracking sites like Downdetector, confirming that the issue is not isolated to a single location. Verizon has acknowledged the problem and is working on a resolution, though the cause of the outage has not been officially stated at the time of the report.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is characterized by widespread speculation about the cause of the outage, with users primarily debating two possibilities: a coordinated cyberattack or a major internal failure.

A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the potential for a cyberattack. Some users theorize that this could be a "state on state" attack, while others point to recent government actions against journalists as a potential motive for a deliberate shutdown. This speculation is fueled by reports from some users that other carriers like T-Mobile and AT&T are also experiencing issues, which would suggest a coordinated incident. However, other users offer a more mundane explanation, suggesting that reports of other outages are likely just people failing to connect to Verizon customers and misinterpreting it as a wider problem.

The counter-argument, and the most popular theory among skeptical commenters, is that the outage is the result of a self-inflicted error, such as a bad configuration update. Users provide historical examples of major tech and telecom companies like Cloudflare, Meta, and a large Canadian telco accidentally taking themselves offline. This view posits that human error is a far more common cause for such large-scale failures than malicious attacks.

The discussion also branches into related topics. Some users note that the outage appears to be affecting the West Coast and question the official "thousands" estimate, believing the number to be much higher. Others discuss the potential impact on services that rely on Verizon's infrastructure, such as the Grok AI API, which was also reported as down. A tangential but notable thread speculates on the possibility of government-ordered communications shutdowns, citing the historical precedent of BART cutting off cell service in its subways.

## [GitHub should charge everyone $1 more per month to fund open source](https://blog.greg.technology/2025/11/27/github-should-charge-1-dollar-more-per-month.html)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46618027

> **Article:** The article proposes that GitHub should increase its subscription price for all paid users (individuals and organizations) by $1 per month. This extra dollar would be collected into a dedicated fund to directly support and sustain the open-source maintainers whose work powers the platform. The author argues that while open source is often given freely, it is not okay to consider this labor a gift that falls from the sky, and the current model is unsustainable. The proposal aims to create a simple, scalable way to give back to the ecosystem without requiring users to make separate donations.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was highly polarized, centering on the ethics of open-source labor, the practicality of the proposal, and the potential for unintended consequences.

A central debate emerged around the nature of open-source contribution. One side argued that open source is fundamentally a gift, and developers who release code under permissive licenses do so with the explicit understanding that there is no expectation of compensation. They contended that trying to shift this social contract is misguided. The other side countered that it's irresponsible to treat this labor as a free gift, especially as it becomes critical infrastructure, and that a more sustainable model is necessary.

Several users raised practical concerns about the proposal. A major fear was the potential for "enshittification" and the creation of perverse incentives. Commenters worried that such a fund would be exploited by people creating low-quality or spammy packages to game the system for financial gain, similar to how some currently manipulate download numbers for resume prestige. Others suggested the fund should reward transitive dependencies (lock files) rather than just top-level packages to better reflect actual usage.

There was also skepticism directed at GitHub and Microsoft. Some argued that, given the revenue from products like Copilot, GitHub should be paying users rather than charging them more. The idea of a tech giant like Microsoft controlling a massive fund for open source was met with distrust.

Finally, some commenters supported the core idea but suggested modifications, such as making it an optional feature or focusing on the sustainability problem from a different angle, like a Universal Basic Income (UBI) for creators.

## [Find a pub that needs you](https://www.ismypubfucked.com/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46617360

> **Article:** The article links to a website called "ismypubfucked.com," a tool that allows users in the UK to enter a postcode to see how their local pub is affected by recent changes to business property taxes (known as "business rates"). The site visualizes the impact by assigning humorous but grim status labels to pubs, such as "Somehow Fine," "Struggling," "Fucked," and "Absolutely Fucked." The tool was created to highlight the severe financial pressure on pubs resulting from the UK government's decision to scale back pandemic-era business rate discounts and increase the "rateable values" of pub properties.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centered on the website's purpose, its usability for a global audience, and the underlying political and economic issues. A primary point of confusion for many non-UK users was the site's lack of explicit geographical context; they were frustrated by "invalid zip code" errors until it was clarified that the tool is for UK postcodes only. This sparked a debate about whether the site's creators should have been more explicit about its UK-only scope.

Beyond usability, users analyzed the serious issue the site highlights: a recent UK budget decision that significantly increased property taxes for pubs by reducing discounts and raising rateable values. Commenters shared examples of staggering tax increases (up to 800% for some pubs) and discussed the broader decline of social institutions in the UK. The site's darkly humorous status labels were widely appreciated, with some users even suggesting they be repurposed for software error logging levels. A minor thread of discussion also questioned the site's accuracy, with one user arguing that some "fucked" pubs deserve their fate due to poor service and quality.

## [The Influentists: AI hype without proof](https://carette.xyz/posts/influentists/)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46623195

> **Article:** The article "The Influentists: AI hype without proof" argues that a significant portion of the current AI hype is driven by "influentists" – influential figures who make extraordinary claims about AI's capabilities without providing verifiable evidence. The author contends that these claims often involve "vibe-coded" projects that are presented as revolutionary but lack substance, reliability, or real-world impact. The piece calls for skepticism and demands for concrete proof rather than accepting anecdotal success stories at face value, suggesting that the gap between the hype and the reality of AI tools is widening.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis, with many users expressing skepticism towards grandiose claims made on social media. A recurring theme is the necessity of deep domain expertise to effectively use AI tools and to identify their frequent errors. Several developers shared personal anecdotes where AI-generated code, particularly in specialized domains like Spark or numerical solvers, was suboptimal or incorrect, and only corrected by human experts. This led to a consensus that the primary value of AI currently lies in augmenting experts, not replacing them.

The conversation also explored the psychological and social dynamics behind the hype. Some users suggested that many viral claims are exaggerated for "follower farming" or are a form of "domestication flex," where people proxy their own value through their AI usage. The reluctance to share proof of AI success was attributed to two main factors: the code being proprietary or, more commonly, the code being embarrassing and full of problems that would invite ridicule.

There was a debate on whether the current state of AI justifies the hype. Some argued that if LLMs were truly a "digital workforce," companies like OpenAI would use them internally to build products rather than selling access. However, others countered that selling the "pickaxes" (the tools) is a proven and often more profitable business model. Ultimately, many commenters expressed fatigue with the polarized "yes it will / no it won't" arguments, advocating for a pragmatic approach of simply trying the tools to see if they provide personal value, while remaining critical of unsubstantiated claims.

## [Minor says ICE took his iPhone, later found in used-electronics vending machine](https://www.propublica.org/article/videos-ice-dhs-immigration-agents-using-chokeholds-citizens)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46611375

> **Article:** An article by ProPublica investigates U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents allegedly using banned chokeholds and excessive force against U.S. citizens during encounters. The report highlights a specific incident involving a teenager named Arnoldo, who was chased and allegedly assaulted by ICE agents after filming them. Agents confiscated his iPhone, but he later located it using "Find My" at a used-electronics vending machine miles from the detention center. The recovered footage reportedly corroborated the family's account of the incident.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News focused primarily on the systemic nature of the alleged misconduct rather than the specific incident details. Commenters expressed concern that the use of banned techniques like chokeholds appears to be a recurring, systemic issue rather than isolated incidents of individual misconduct. There was significant skepticism regarding the rule of law in the U.S., with some users citing unrelated examples like the non-release of Epstein files or the continued operation of TikTok as evidence that laws are treated as "recommendations." Additionally, there was a minor debate regarding the editorialization of the post title, with one user pointing out that the article's main focus was on chokeholds, while the post title highlighted the stolen phone aspect.

## [US freezes visas for 75 nations](https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/world/us-visa-ban-public-charge-bjbpzu02)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 159 | **ID:** 46618809

> **Article:** An article from Mathrubhumi reports that the US has frozen visas for citizens of 75 countries. The policy is framed as a measure against "public charge," where immigrants might rely on government assistance. The article suggests this is a significant expansion of immigration restrictions, impacting a wide range of nations. The title and framing imply a broad, sweeping action by the US government.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the policy, viewing it as discriminatory and a symptom of national decline. Commenters express disappointment and fear that the US is normalizing discrimination based on nationality, which could inspire other countries to follow suit. There is widespread concern over the economic and reputational damage, with one user calling it the "century of humiliation" and another noting that a talented colleague with a green card has already left for a job in Brussels, citing superior social benefits and safety in Europe as reasons.

The conversation also touches on the practical implications of such a ban. Users question how the US will host major international events like the World Cup if foreign athletes are barred from entry. There is also significant discussion about the impact on the tech industry, with fears of a "brain drain" as skilled workers from affected countries like Russia and Iran may be forced to leave or choose not to come.

Several comments attempt to clarify the scope of the ban. One user points out that India is not on the list, which seems contradictory given its economic ties with Russia. Another provides a more nuanced view, suggesting the freeze is temporary and limited to immigration visas, not all visa types. However, skepticism remains about whether the freeze will actually be lifted and what the long-term, more restrictive rules will be. The discussion concludes with a debate on the "public charge" justification, with one user explaining that US visa processes already have robust financial support requirements, questioning the stated need for such a drastic measure.
