**Score:** 1020 | **Comments:** 452 | **ID:** 46488819

> **Article:** The article "Lessons from 14 years at Google" is a collection of career and engineering insights from Addy Osmani's long tenure at the company. The lessons cover a wide range of topics, emphasizing pragmatism over cleverness. Key themes include:
*   **Simplicity and Risk:** Avoiding unnecessary novelty ("innovation tokens") and complex abstractions, which create hidden costs in maintenance and outages.
*   **Action and Iteration:** The importance of shipping early and often ("you can edit a bad page, but you can’t edit a blank one") to reveal real-world problems.
*   **Scale and Behavior:** Acknowledging that at scale, even bugs become features that users depend on (Hyrum's Law).
*   **Collaboration and Influence:** The need for soft skills, such as building consensus rather than winning every argument, and the value of writing to achieve clarity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely praised the article for its collection of timeless, pragmatic wisdom, with many commenters stating the lessons apply to any organization, not just Google. The discussion centered on several key themes:

*   **The Value of Simplicity:** Many users highlighted warnings against "cleverness" and novelty. They agreed that experienced engineers learn to prefer boring, simple technologies over new, complex ones, citing the "innovation tokens" concept and Joel Spolsky's "Law of Leaky Abstractions."
*   **The Power of Shipping:** The advice to "ship" was popular, with one user noting that the first step of any project reveals a host of hidden logistical and technical problems that are impossible to foresee in planning.
*   **Real-World Impact:** The idea that "at scale, even your bugs have users" resonated deeply. Commenters shared anecdotes of users depending on unintended behaviors, reinforcing that software exists within a human system and must be understood in its real-world context.
*   **A Contentious Sub-Theme (AI Authorship):** A notable point of contention was the article's writing style. While some praised its clarity, a significant minority argued it was AI-generated or heavily AI-assisted, describing it as "bland" and filled with "LLM-isms." This sparked a meta-debate about the value and authenticity of AI-polished prose.

## [The unbearable joy of sitting alone in a café](https://candost.blog/the-unbearable-joy-of-sitting-alone-in-a-cafe/)
**Score:** 524 | **Comments:** 311 | **ID:** 46488355

> **Article:** The article "The unbearable joy of sitting alone in a café" describes the author's personal experience of intentionally leaving their phone at home and going to a café alone. The author frames this act as a "rebellious" and "contradictory" one, arguing that cafés are designed as social meeting spaces and that sitting alone without a device feels awkward and weird. They detail the initial discomfort and the eventual joy of being present, people-watching, and being alone with their thoughts, presenting it as a novel act of self-care and a way to reclaim attention from technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the article's premise, viewing it as a romanticized or out-of-touch perspective. The dominant sentiment is that sitting alone in a café is an entirely normal and common activity, not a strange or rebellious act. Many commenters express confusion or amusement at the author's portrayal of it as a "contradictory" or difficult experience.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Normalization vs. Novelty:** The majority of commenters found the author's framing absurd, stating they regularly sit in cafes alone for practical reasons (work, a break, waiting) without any sense of awkwardness. This led to a recurring joke that the author is a "techbro discovering a common thing."
*   **The Phone as a Central Issue:** While many found the author's struggle with phone addiction relatable, they disagreed on whether it's a universal experience. Some argued that not looking at one's phone feels perfectly natural, while others acknowledged that for many, the absence of a phone is what makes the experience feel strange.
*   **Cultural and Class Perspectives:** A few commenters introduced different angles. Some suggested the author's anxiety is an American cultural phenomenon, contrasting it with European or Japanese cafe cultures where sitting alone is more accepted. Others brought up a social class dimension, noting that in some contexts, sitting alone without a laptop or phone can be associated with homelessness, which might fuel the feeling of being "weird."
*   **Anxiety and Exposure Therapy:** A sub-thread developed around the idea that the author's anxiety is a symptom of a modern lack of "exposure therapy." These commenters argued that before smartphones, people were forced into more uncomfortable social situations, which built resilience, and that the author's experience is simply a matter of getting used to it.

## [Web development is fun again](https://ma.ttias.be/web-development-is-fun-again/)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 413 | **ID:** 46488576

> **Article:** The article "Web development is fun again" argues that the rise of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) is revitalizing the joy of software creation. The author posits that modern web development had become overly complex, with intimidating build pipelines, sprawling frameworks, and a steep "activation energy" required to start new projects. LLMs act as a powerful equalizer, drastically lowering this barrier to entry. They handle the boilerplate, manage complex APIs, and allow developers to focus on high-level ideas and architecture rather than getting bogged down in implementation details. This shift makes building things feel accessible and enjoyable again, especially for experienced developers who may have been sidelined by the ecosystem's complexity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide on whether AI is making development more or less enjoyable, with the overall tone being cautiously optimistic but with significant caveats.

A prominent theme is the "democratization of creation." Many commenters strongly agree with the article, sharing personal experiences of how LLMs have enabled them to start and finish personal projects that were previously impossible due to time constraints, such as parenting or management roles. They argue that AI "bails developers out" of the impending ultra-specialization required for domains like embedded systems or GPU programming, allowing them to focus on high-level abstractions and overcome the initial friction of starting a project. This group sees AI as a tool that handles the "chores," freeing them to be creative.

However, a counter-argument posits that this is a superficial fix for a self-inflicted problem. One commenter suggests that LLMs are successful precisely because the frontend ecosystem has become unnecessarily complex with "slop" and frameworks built for job security rather than technical necessity. Another pointedly remarks that while the author feels like they're painting, it feels to them more like they are doing the chores while the AI paints, suggesting a loss of agency.

Finally, there is a significant undercurrent of caution regarding engineering quality. Several developers warn that the speed of AI-assisted coding can lead to "poor engineering hygiene" and a lack of fundamental understanding. A particularly critical comment challenges the author's premise, arguing that if someone finds starting a project "insurmountable" without AI, they likely lack the foundational skills to debug the complex code the AI generates. This highlights a core tension: is AI a crutch that weakens skills, or a prosthetic that enhances them?

## [Street Fighter II, the World Warrier (2021)](https://fabiensanglard.net/sf2_warrier/)
**Score:** 338 | **Comments:** 57 | **ID:** 46488278

> **Article:** The article from fabiensanglard.net provides a technical deep-dive into a famous typo in the original arcade release of *Street Fighter II: The World Warrior*. The title screen incorrectly displayed "WORLD WARRIER" instead of "WARRIOR". The author explains that this was not a simple spelling mistake but a hardware limitation. The game's graphics were stored in ROM, meaning the typo was physically "set in stone" once the chips were manufactured.

The piece details the clever, low-level graphical fix implemented by artist Akiman. Because they could not change the font ROM, he had to manually edit the character tiles in the graphics memory during the game's startup sequence. To change the 'R' to an 'I', he used a single-pixel tile, cleverly repurposed from Guile's calf muscle sprite, to mask the bottom-right pixel of the 'R', visually transforming it into an 'I'. The article highlights this as a brilliant example of creative problem-solving under severe hardware constraints.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a mix of appreciation for the article's technical details and nostalgic reflection on the arcade era. The community's reaction can be grouped into several themes:

*   **Nostalgia for the Arcade Experience:** Many users shared personal stories and romanticized the pre-internet social aspect of arcades. Comments described the "quarter system" for queuing, the shared atmosphere of watching and learning from other players, and the "real-world" social bonding that took place, contrasting it with modern online gaming.

*   **Technical and Historical Analysis:** Users engaged with the technical details of the fix, with some correcting terminology (e.g., noting that "draw calls" is a modern concept and this was closer to direct memory manipulation). There was also some skepticism and fact-checking of similar "lost in translation" anecdotes, such as a disputed typo in the game *Continental Circus*.

*   **Cultural Appreciation:** One highly-upvoted comment framed the fix through a Japanese cultural lens, using concepts like "Forging" (disciplined mastery) and "Mitate" (seeing one thing as another) to describe the artist's ingenuity. This perspective argued that such obsessive attention to detail is what gives classic games their longevity.

*   **Broader Connections:** The discussion branched out to other related topics, including a similar "dirty hack" story from the development of *Ratchet and Clank*, and a reference to another famous game development typo fix ("Bimmy and Jimmy" in *Double Dragon*).

## [Can I start using Wayland in 2026?](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-01-04-wayland-sway-in-2026/)
**Score:** 285 | **Comments:** 241 | **ID:** 46485989

> **Article:** The article "Can I start using Wayland in 2026?" is a detailed, personal account of the author's attempt to switch from his stable X11/i3 setup to Sway (a tiling Wayland compositor) on a new laptop. The author documents his journey, highlighting both the progress made and the significant remaining friction points.

Key positive findings include:
*   Good performance and battery life.
*   Excellent multi-monitor support and scaling, a major improvement over X11.
*   The core functionality of his tiling workflow (windows, workspaces) works well.

However, he identifies several major blockers that prevent a full switch:
*   **Missing Features:** No reliable global keyboard shortcut support (affecting tools like `xdotool` and custom scripts), no working system-wide screenshot tool, and no clipboard manager that works across all apps.
*   **Application Incompatibility:** Some applications, like the KeePassXC password manager, fail to function correctly under Wayland.
*   **Workflow Gaps:** The lack of a "focus follows mouse" feature is a personal deal-breaker for his workflow.

The author concludes that while Wayland has matured significantly, it is not yet ready for his specific, power-user workflow due to the lack of standardized protocols and feature parity with the X11 ecosystem.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and polarized divide over Wayland's architecture and readiness. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

**1. Architectural Criticism vs. Defense:**
A central debate revolves around Wayland's design philosophy. Critics argue that Wayland makes a "bonkers" decision by pushing complexity from the single display server layer (Xorg) into the many, competing compositor implementations (GNOME, KDE, wlroots). This forces each desktop to "reinvent the wheel" and handle low-level driver quirks, leading to fragmentation and inconsistent issues. Proponents, however, defend the architecture, stating that on paper it's a cleaner design that removes legacy cruft and allows compositors to manage rendering and input more directly and efficiently.

**2. The "It Just Works" vs. "It's Still Broken" Divide:**
User experience is highly dependent on hardware and use case.
*   **Positive Camp:** Users with modern AMD GPUs or simple setups (single monitor, no exotic needs) report that Wayland is "buttery smooth," solves screen tearing, and handles fractional scaling perfectly. They often can't relate to the complaints.
*   **Negative Camp:** Users with NVIDIA GPUs, complex multi-monitor configurations, or specific workflow needs (like the article's author) report persistent glitches, flickering, application crashes, and missing features that make Wayland unusable as a daily driver.

**3. The Inevitability Argument:**
Regardless of current issues, many commenters believe Wayland is the future simply because it's where the development effort is. Xorg is in maintenance mode, and its maintainers have moved on. Distributions will eventually force the switch, making the debate about preference secondary to the reality of support and development momentum.

**4. Practical Concerns and Workarounds:**
The discussion highlights the real-world complexity of the fragmented ecosystem. One user details the confusing landscape of `xdg-desktop-portal` implementations needed for basic features like screenshots and screen sharing, which vary between compositors (e.g., `wlr` for most wlroots, a separate fork for Hyprland). This reinforces the article's point about the lack of a unified, stable base.

In essence, the comments show that while Wayland offers compelling technical advantages for the future, its fragmented implementation and the lack of standardized, universally adopted protocols for common tasks remain significant barriers to widespread adoption, especially for users with complex or established workflows.

## [Claude Code On-the-Go](https://granda.org/en/2026/01/02/claude-code-on-the-go/)
**Score:** 269 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46491486

> **Article:** The article "Claude Code On-the-Go" details a technical setup for running Anthropic's AI coding assistant, Claude Code, from a mobile device. The author uses a combination of an iPad with the Termius SSH client and a Tailscale VPN to securely connect to a home server or a disposable cloud VM where the coding environment and source code reside. This allows the user to initiate and manage long-running coding tasks, such as refactoring or feature implementation, while away from their desk (e.g., walking the dog or waiting in line). The setup effectively turns the mobile device into a remote terminal for an AI agent, enabling continuous productivity outside of traditional work hours and locations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of admiration for the technical ingenuity and significant skepticism about the practicality and desirability of such a workflow.

A central theme is the **trade-off between convenience and control**. While some users, like the original poster `simonw`, find value in running AI sessions on cloud VMs provided by Anthropic, others point out the limitations. Commenters like `jascha_eng` argue that mobile development is fundamentally hampered by the inability to easily run, test, and verify code, as well as the difficulty of engaging in the deep, iterative planning that complex tasks require. The cognitive overhead of context switching on a small screen is also a major concern.

The discussion also touches on **security and risk**. Several users expressed unease about the potential for the AI to perform unexpected actions on a machine with SSH key access, though others suggested safer alternatives like using repository-specific access tokens.

Finally, a significant undercurrent of **existential dread** is present. User `sideway` poignantly articulates a fear of a future where "white collar workers will be working 24/7," unable to escape work even during daily life. This sentiment captures a broader anxiety about the "always-on" culture that such powerful, mobile-enabled tools could foster, despite the clear technical benefits for productivity.

## [Anti-aging injection regrows knee cartilage and prevents arthritis](https://scitechdaily.com/anti-aging-injection-regrows-knee-cartilage-and-prevents-arthritis/)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46488711

> **Article:** A study published in *Science* reports that inhibiting an enzyme called 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) can regenerate cartilage and reduce osteoarthritis pain. The research, conducted primarily in mice, used a small molecule inhibitor (SW033291) to achieve these results. The article also notes that human knee tissue samples taken during joint replacement surgeries responded positively to the treatment in a lab setting, and mentions that a pill-based version of the therapy is already in clinical trials to treat muscle weakness in older adults.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was a mix of excitement and typical skepticism for early-stage medical research. The most dominant theme was a recurring caution that the successful results were observed in mice, with several users humorously noting that "mice are having a great time" with all the experimental therapies. However, this was immediately balanced by others pointing out that the study also showed positive results on human knee tissue samples collected from surgeries, suggesting the findings may be more applicable than the "in mice" caveat implies.

Personal stories were common, with users sharing their own struggles with knee, hand, and thumb arthritis, expressing hope that this research could lead to real-world solutions. There was also a side discussion on the nature of "final frontiers" in health, with some arguing cartilage regeneration is key, while others countered that nerve regeneration is the ultimate challenge.

Several comments dug into the science, identifying the compound used (SW033291) and the specific enzyme it targets (15-PGDH). One user noted that JAK-STAT inhibitors, which are already used in humans, also affect this pathway, though they are expensive. The potential economic impact was briefly touched upon, with one user suggesting knee replacement surgeons might worry, while another countered that doctors are primarily concerned with patient quality of life and would welcome such a treatment.

## [Jeffgeerling.com has been migrated to Hugo](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/migrated-to-hugo/)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 193 | **ID:** 46487498

> **Article:** Jeff Geerling, a prominent tech blogger, has migrated his blog from WordPress to the static site generator Hugo. His primary motivation was to reduce long-term maintenance overhead and complexity. He advocates for "sticking to the defaults" and keeping the setup simple to ensure the site remains stable and easy to manage over time.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates Jeff Geerling's move to a static site but explores the nuances and potential pitfalls. A key theme is the trade-off between simplicity and maintenance. One commenter warns that Hugo can become high-maintenance if one uses a complex, forked theme, as breaking changes in new Hugo versions can render a site uncompilable. This led to a sub-thread of advice on how to ensure long-term stability, with suggestions ranging from committing the Hugo binary to source control to using version-pinned build environments like Docker or asdf.

The conversation also branched into related topics. Some users discussed alternative static site generators like Zola, while others debated the best deployment strategies, with one user detailing a robust CI/CD pipeline using AWS Lambda for a fully automated, maintenance-free build and deploy process. There were also minor, tangential discussions about identifying browser extensions from a screenshot in the original article and a brief comment on the site's high-contrast color scheme.

## [Show HN: An interactive guide to how browsers work](https://howbrowserswork.com/)
**Score:** 205 | **Comments:** 31 | **ID:** 46488654

> **Project:** This project is an interactive, web-based guide titled "How Browsers Work". The site aims to explain the complex process of web browsing in a simplified, step-by-step manner. It covers the journey of a web page from the user typing a URL to the final render, including topics like DNS lookups, TCP handshakes, HTTP requests, and an introduction to the DOM and rendering engine. The format is designed to be an accessible and engaging learning resource for developers and curious users.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the project was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising it as a neat and exciting way to understand a complex topic. The discussion centered on three main themes: the project's content and scope, its technical execution, and related resources.

Several users provided specific feedback and suggestions for improvement:
*   **Scope and Content:** Commenters suggested expanding the guide. Key requests included adding visuals to illustrate client-server interactions, explaining how secondary resources (images, scripts, CSS) are loaded, and providing a deeper dive into the parsing and rendering pipeline, which was seen as the most complex part of a browser.
*   **Technical Accuracy:** A few users pointed out minor inaccuracies, such as how browsers handle URL transformations (e.g., they only auto-complete schemes for valid TLDs) and the historical context of the DOM. The author was responsive and acknowledged these points.
*   **Related Resources:** The discussion also became a valuable resource in itself. Users highly recommended other educational materials like "High-Performance Browser Networking" (HPBN.co) and "Every Layout.dev". One user even shared their own project—a toy browser written in Python—sparking a sub-thread on browser development complexity and performance.

Overall, the community engagement was constructive, with the author actively soliciting and responding to feedback to guide future development of the guide.

## [The Gentle Seduction (1989)](http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/GentleSeduction.html)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46486135

> **Article:** "The Gentle Seduction" is a 1989 science fiction story by Marc Stiegler that presents a utopian vision of the future through the life of its protagonist, a woman named Janet. Initially skeptical of technology and the concept of uploading human consciousness, Janet is gradually won over by a series of incremental technological advancements. The story details her progression from rejecting a simple AI companion to eventually embracing full cybernetic augmentation, body-swapping, and finally, merging her consciousness into a vast, cosmic intelligence. The narrative's core argument is that the transition to a post-human future will not be a violent or disruptive event, but a "gentle seduction" where the benefits of technology are so compelling that humanity will willingly and slowly embrace them, losing its original form in the process.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on "The Gentle Seduction" reveals a sharp divide between techno-optimists and techno-pessimists, with the story acting as a Rorschach test for readers' views on the future of technology and humanity.

A significant portion of the comments are deeply appreciative of the story's vision. These users see it as a compelling and relevant counter-narrative to rising "techno-pessimism," viewing the described future as a desirable outcome and a potential cure for the limitations of biological life. One commenter even expresses a personal hope that cryonics might allow them to reach such a future.

However, this optimistic view is strongly challenged by others who argue the story presents a dangerously naive and simplistic picture. Critics point to contemporary issues like mass surveillance, the centralization of power, and the negative societal impacts of social media as evidence that the "gentle seduction" is more likely to be a descent into "abominable serfdom" and hedonistic escapism. The worldview of the optimistic camp (e.g., interest in cryonics) is explicitly called out as being part of this problem.

Beyond this central conflict, other perspectives emerge. Some readers found the story's linear, conflict-free narrative unengaging or bland, while others noted its age and debated the accuracy of its predictions about the timeline to technological singularity. The story also prompted philosophical reflections on the nature of death, with one commenter arguing that a finite life gives it meaning, while another countered that death is a terrifying void and an immortal, happy existence is preferable. Finally, several commenters recommended other works as companion pieces, either to explore the same theme from a different angle or to serve as a direct counterpoint to the story's utopianism.

## [Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/674129/why-does-a-linear-least-squares-fit-appear-to-have-a-bias-when-applied-to-simple)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 48 | **ID:** 46491821

> **Article:** The article (a Cross-Validated post) addresses a common visual confusion: when applying a standard linear least squares fit (regressing y on x), the resulting line often appears to "miss" the data points, especially when compared to a line that visually bisects the data cloud. The user asks why this standard method seems to introduce a "bias."

The core issue is that Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) minimizes the sum of the *squared vertical distances* between the data points and the line. This method implicitly assumes that the independent variable (x) is measured without error, while all the noise and variability exist only in the dependent variable (y). Consequently, the fitted line is biased towards predicting y for a given x, but not vice-versa. If you were to plot x against y, you would get a different regression line. This asymmetry is the source of the visual "bias" when compared to a line that attempts to minimize the perpendicular (shortest) distance to the points, which assumes noise in both variables.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on explaining the mathematical and conceptual reasons for this visual asymmetry and proposing alternatives. A key theme is the distinction between different types of regression based on their assumptions about noise. Commenters point out that OLS minimizes vertical errors, while Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Total Least Squares (TLS) minimizes the perpendicular distance to the line, effectively modeling noise in both x and y. This difference in loss functions explains why the resulting lines are different.

Several users suggest that the "bias" is only a problem if the initial assumption of error-free x-values is incorrect. In many real-world scenarios, such as sensor data where time is the x-axis, this assumption is valid because the time measurement is far more precise than the sensor reading. However, when both variables are noisy measurements, practitioners recommend alternatives like Deming regression or TLS, which account for error in both dimensions. Deming regression is highlighted as a general solution that allows for specifying the ratio of the variances of the errors in y and x. The conversation concludes by clarifying that while the fitted line may look visually skewed, it is statistically "unbiased" in its predictions for y given x, according to the strict definition of the term.

## [Maybe comments should explain 'what' (2017)](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/what-comments/)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 185 | **ID:** 46486780

> **Article:** The 2017 article by Hillel Wayne argues against the dogmatic idea that comments should only explain "why" (the rationale behind code) and never "what" (what the code is doing). He contends that while "why" comments are valuable, "what" comments are often necessary for readability. Wayne provides examples where code is complex or uses clever tricks, and a simple comment explaining the mechanism is more effective than trying to force that explanation into a long, verbose function name. He also points out that in data processing pipelines or with regular expressions, a comment explaining the transformation can be much clearer than reading through the code itself. The core message is that the primary goal of comments is to aid understanding, and a blanket ban on "what" comments is counterproductive to that goal.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise, with many developers sharing their frustration with overly dogmatic programming advice, particularly from "Uncle Bob" (Robert C. Martin). A key theme is the backlash against excessive method extraction, where "go to definition" becomes a constant chore that hinders readability rather than helping it. While some users caution that the article's description of "extracting every line into a method" is a strawman of Uncle Bob's actual advice, the sentiment that this style of abstraction can be harmful is widely shared.

The discussion also refines the "what vs. why" distinction. Several commenters argue that "what" comments are essential when code encodes complex business rules or domain knowledge that cannot be easily inferred from the code itself. In these cases, explaining the business logic (the "what") is effectively explaining the "why" and is crucial for future maintainers. The debate also touches on practical alternatives, such as using top-of-function comments for a high-level summary versus inline comments for specific lines. The overall consensus leans towards pragmatism: comments should be used to make code understandable, regardless of a strict "what" or "why" classification, and developers should be wary of applying any single rule without considering the context.

## [JavaScript engines zoo – Compare every JavaScript engine](https://zoo.js.org/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46486978

> **Article:** The article links to "JavaScript engines zoo," a comprehensive website that compares numerous JavaScript execution engines. The site presents a detailed comparison table covering metrics like performance (benchmarks), ES6 compatibility, lines of code, binary size, and the number of contributors for each engine. It includes major engines like V8 (Chrome/Node), JavaScriptCore (Safari), and SpiderMonkey (Firefox), as well as lesser-known and niche implementations like Brimstone, Hermes, and various Java-based engines.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing surprise and admiration for the depth of the data presented. Key takeaways include:

*   **Performance Surprises:** Several users were shocked to learn that JavaScriptCore (Safari) consistently outperforms V8 (Chrome) in the benchmarks shown. Conversely, there was disappointment regarding SpiderMonkey's (Firefox) lower performance scores compared to the other two major engines.
*   **Niche Engine Feats:** A major point of interest was Brimstone, a project with a single contributor and a tiny codebase (74k LoC) that achieves 97% ES6 compatibility, a feat users called a "staggering accomplishment."
*   **Upcoming Tech:** Users highlighted the impressive performance of Static Hermes (Meta's engine for React Native), especially when JIT is disabled, suggesting it could significantly boost React Native app performance.
*   **Technical Details & Caveats:** Users discussed the reasons behind compatibility scores (attributing V8's 98% score largely to the lack of tail call optimization) and expressed a strong desire for memory usage comparisons, which a contributor noted can be generated via the project's command-line tool.
*   **General Appreciation:** The sheer volume of aggregated data and the effort required to compile the comparison were frequently praised.

## [Understanding the bin, sbin, usr/bin, usr/sbin split (2010)](https://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/busybox/2010-December/074114.html)
**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 128 | **ID:** 46487921

> **Article:** The article, a 2010 mailing list post by Rob Landley, is a historical explanation of the confusing directory structure in Unix-like systems (`/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, etc.). Landley argues that these directories are not the result of a grand design, but rather an accumulation of historical accidents and constraints from the early days of computing.

He traces the origins to when `/bin` and `/sbin` were on the root filesystem (often a small disk), while `/usr` was for the "user" filesystem on a larger, separate disk. As hardware evolved and disk space became cheaper, the original reasons for the split became obsolete, but the structure remained for backward compatibility. The article concludes that the split is a legacy artifact, not a logical modern design.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely validates the article's premise, treating the directory structure as a form of historical cruft. A central theme is the tension between maintaining legacy standards for compatibility versus redesigning for modern systems.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **Historical Justification:** Several users provide context for the original split, explaining it was a practical necessity due to expensive, small disks and the need to separate critical boot files (`/bin`) from the larger "user" application space (`/usr`). The `s` in `sbin` was noted as a distinction for system administration binaries not needed by regular users.
*   **Modern Consequences and Workarounds:** Commenters point out how this legacy persists in modern practices, such as the use of `/opt` for self-contained applications and the rise of immutable operating systems (like Alpine and MicroOS) that use `/var` for writable data, ironically bringing back a concept similar to the original `/usr` split.
*   **Attempts at Reform:** Users mention efforts to simplify this, such as Arch Linux's move to consolidate binaries into `/usr/bin`. However, the existence of alternative systems like GoboLinux and NixOS/Guix is noted, which attempt to create more logical structures but remain niche.
*   **Cynicism and Futility:** A recurring sentiment is that this complexity is now maintained by inertia and standards bodies, with one user comparing it to the "XKCD #927" problem of competing standards. The consensus is that while the structure is confusing and illogical by today's standards, it's unlikely to ever be "fixed" due to the immense weight of backward compatibility.

## [FreeBSD Home NAS, part 3: WireGuard VPN, routing, and Linux peers](https://rtfm.co.ua/en/freebsd-home-nas-part-3-wireguard-vpn-linux-peer-and-routing/)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 8 | **ID:** 46487120

> **Article:** The article is the third part of a series on building a home NAS with FreeBSD. It provides a detailed, step-by-step guide on setting up a WireGuard VPN server on the FreeBSD NAS. The guide covers the installation of WireGuard, generating cryptographic keys for the server and clients, and creating configuration files. A significant portion is dedicated to configuring network routing to allow VPN clients to access the local network and the internet through the NAS. It also includes specific instructions for configuring a Linux-based peer, addressing differences in firewall rules and routing between the two operating systems. The post is a practical, hands-on tutorial for system administrators looking to implement a secure remote access solution.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on a comparison between WireGuard and OpenVPN, sparked by a comment arguing for OpenVPN's superiority. The main points of contention revolve around features, performance, and security.

One user presents a case for OpenVPN, citing its modern kernel-mode offloading (DCO) which can offer better performance, and its superior handling of dynamic DNS and multi-WAN setups, which they describe as "quality of life" features that work out-of-the-box. They characterize WireGuard as requiring "duct tape" for such resiliency.

In response, defenders of WireGuard highlight its significant security advantage: its "silent" nature. Unlike OpenVPN, which responds to unauthenticated probes, WireGuard only replies when presented with a valid cryptographic key. This makes it invisible to port scanners and significantly harder for attackers to discover and target with exploits. The conversation also touches on practical workarounds, such as running OpenVPN on port 443 behind a proxy like sslh to bypass restrictive firewalls, while acknowledging WireGuard's widespread kernel integration and maturity.

## [I changed my personality in six weeks](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260102-how-i-changed-my-personality-in-six-weeks)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46491623

> **Article:** The BBC Future article details a journalist's six-week experiment to alter her core personality traits, based on the scientific concept that personality is malleable, not fixed. Guided by a psychologist, she targeted the "Big Five" traits: aiming to increase Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness, while decreasing Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Her methods were practical and behavioral: to boost Conscientiousness, she used detailed to-do lists and the "two-minute rule" (if a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately); for Extraversion, she initiated conversations with strangers; for Openness, she explored new hobbies and foods; to reduce Neuroticism, she practiced mindfulness and reframed negative thoughts; and to become less Agreeable, she practiced saying "no" and set firmer boundaries. The article reports that after six weeks, a follow-up personality test showed significant shifts in her desired direction, particularly in Neuroticism and Extraversion. The piece concludes that individuals can consciously influence their personality by consistently practicing new behaviors and thought patterns.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the article was multifaceted, exploring the validity of the experiment, the societal value of different personality traits, and the broader context of personal change.

A central theme was skepticism about the experiment's methodology and results. Several commenters questioned the reliability of self-reported data, suggesting the author may have been subconsciously gaming the test to reflect the outcome she wanted. They pointed to the short six-week timeframe and the lack of an objective measure (like a partner's assessment) as weaknesses, arguing that personality is "stable" but not necessarily "fixed," and long-term change is what truly matters.

The conversation also delved into the value of specific traits, particularly the extroversion/introversion dichotomy. While the article framed increased extroversion as a positive, some commenters pushed back, arguing that society overvalues it and that introversion or sensory sensitivity can be innate, unchangeable traits. Others countered that being more extroverted is simply a useful social skill, like being able to make small talk.

Many commenters shared personal anecdotes that supported the idea of personality malleability through significant life events. One user described how the trauma of having a special-needs child made their wife more assertive and "disagreeable" in a necessary, positive way. Another noted that the pandemic had the opposite effect on them, making them more confident and extraverted despite the difficulties. These stories were used to argue that personality change is often a response to circumstance rather than a conscious, short-term project.

Finally, the discussion touched on established frameworks for personal change. The 12-step program was highlighted as a "spiritual technology" for reorganizing personality, with one user providing a secularized summary of the steps. The article's methods were identified as standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy. A philosophical counterpoint was also raised, with one user expressing contentment with their personality as it is, questioning the need for change, while another suggested that practicing different traits could be a valuable life skill.

## [California residents can now request all data brokers delete personal info](https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46495220

> **Article:** The article announces a new official platform from the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) that allows California residents to submit a single request to all registered data brokers to delete their personal information. This initiative is part of the California Delete Act, which builds upon the existing California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The platform aims to streamline the process of removing personal data from the numerous companies that collect and sell it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on several key aspects of the new service. A primary clarification was that while the right to delete data already existed, the new platform simplifies the process by allowing a single, centralized request to all registered brokers, who are now required by law to register with the state.

However, skepticism was widespread. Many users questioned the long-term effectiveness, pointing out that data is constantly re-collected from other sources and state lines are irrelevant to data brokers. There was also significant frustration with the implementation of the web form itself, with users reporting technical issues like a cumbersome date-of-picker and Cloudflare blocking access.

The conversation broadened to the fundamental ethics of data collection, with many commenters arguing that the entire system is flawed because it operates on an "opt-out" rather than an "opt-in" basis. Others expressed a desire for a federal version of this law but were pessimistic about its chances. Finally, a practical debate emerged about the law's real-world impact, with one user sharing a personal story about how easily accessible data led to a real-life safety concern, arguing that the law is crucial for protecting people from harassment and violence.

## [Moiré Explorer](https://play.ertdfgcvb.xyz/#/src/demos/moire_explorer)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 18 | **ID:** 46487472

> **Article:** The article links to "Moiré Explorer," an interactive web-based tool for creating and manipulating moiré patterns. The tool features a live code editor alongside a visual output, allowing users to experiment with algorithms for generating these visual effects. It is presented as a creative coding environment, with the author noting features like immediate mode (real-time updates as you type) and a well-designed, compact UI. The project is part of a larger portfolio of creative coding work by the author, Andreas Jörgensen.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with strong enthusiasm, praising the tool's design, interactivity, and nostalgic value. The discussion can be summarized into several key themes:

*   **Appreciation and Functionality:** Users found the tool "very cool" and "maddeningly cool," with several commenting on the excellent UI/UX, including the layout, font choice, and the live code editor. Practical tips were shared, such as using `Ctrl+Shift+C` to copy a frame and `CMD+I` for immediate mode.

*   **Nostalgia and Historical Context:** Many commenters connected the project to the early days of computing. The ASCII-style graphics were compared to 1970s computer art, specifically referencing the book "What to Do After You Hit Return." The project was seen as a modern, high-performance evolution of that aesthetic.

*   **Technical Observations and Curiosity:** A few users noted technical details, such as the specific monospace font used ("LL Simple Console") and a browser-specific rendering bug with box-drawing characters in Firefox. The underlying principle of moiré patterns was described as a simple interaction of waves.

*   **Author's Ecosystem:** The creator's broader website (ertdfgcvb.xyz) was recommended, described as a body of work demonstrating a "complete commitment to an idea." However, this recommendation was met with a minor point of friction when one user dismissed the site upon seeing NFT-related content.

*   **Domain Name Speculation:** The unconventional domain name "ertdfgcvb.xyz" sparked a brief sub-thread, with users speculating it was either meaningless or a puzzle, ultimately noting it corresponds to a 3x3 grid on a QWERTY keyboard.

*   **Personal Reactions:** The visual effect elicited strong personal responses, ranging from a user who had "no idea what I'm looking at but it's cool AF" to another who reported that moiré patterns induce intense nausea.

## [North Dakota law lists fake critical minerals based on coal lawyers' names](https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/government-politics/article_515812a0-d29a-4161-91f1-3e53003e2911.html)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46492161

> **Article:** A new North Dakota law promoting the development of critical minerals has been found to include two fake minerals: "friezium" and "stralium." These names are apparent references to Christopher Friez and David Straley, attorneys for North American Coal who were involved in drafting the bill. A third fictional mineral, "docterium" (a reference to Rep. Jason Dockter), was discovered and removed from an earlier draft of the legislation before it was enacted. The incident highlights that the bill was largely written by industry representatives and passed without sufficient expert review to catch the errors.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely critical and cynical, focusing on the implications of the incident rather than the humor of the mistake. The key themes are:

*   **Industry Influence and Legislative Negligence:** The dominant sentiment is that this is a clear example of corporations writing laws for their own benefit. Commenters express outrage that lawmakers not only allowed this but also failed to perform basic due diligence by reading the bill they were passing. The "docterium" fix is seen as insufficient, as it didn't prompt a full review of the suspiciously drafted list.
*   **Lack of Accountability:** Many users argue that the politicians responsible will face no consequences. They predict that voters will re-elect the incumbents and that the industry groups that benefited will continue to fund their campaigns. The embarrassment is seen as a minor political inconvenience rather than a failure of governance.
*   **Broader Context:** The incident is compared to other examples of industry-written legislation, such as a California AI bill and an Arizona immigration bill, suggesting this is a systemic problem. A parallel is also drawn to Canada's firearm ban, which reportedly included fictional guns from video games, indicating that poorly researched legislation is not unique to this case.
*   **Proposed Solutions (and their flaws):** Some commenters proposed radical solutions, like mandatory comprehension tests for legislators, but others immediately pointed out the potential for such tests to be abused or create new problems.
*   **Technical Inaccuracy:** One commenter noted that the list was flawed beyond the fake names, as it confused minerals with elements and used incorrect terminology.
