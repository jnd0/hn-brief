## [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Score:** 1720 | **Comments:** 695 | **ID:** 46497712

> **Article:** The article "It's hard to justify Tahoe icons" by Anton Troynikov argues that Apple's recent UI changes in macOS (specifically the "Tahoe" aesthetic) represent a regression in usability and design principles. The author critiques the removal of icons from menu items, which he argues breaks a key visual scanning pattern that helps users quickly navigate complex menus. He contrasts this with the more consistent and functional icon usage in older operating systems like Windows 2000 and even modern Linux desktop environments. The piece suggests this change is part of a broader trend where design prioritizes aesthetics or "newness" over established, functional user experience patterns.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by a central irony pointed out by numerous commenters: the article, which criticizes distracting and unnecessary UI elements, is hosted on a website that features an animated snow effect. This initial reaction splits the conversation. One thread focuses on criticizing the author's own web design choices, with users finding the snow, bright orange toggle, and cursor effects to be ironic, annoying, and poor for readability, with some noting they had to use a reader mode to get through the article. A counter-argument emerges that a personal blog is an acceptable place for "fun" and optional flair, unlike a mass-market operating system from a trillion-dollar company where usability is paramount.

A second, more substantive thread uses the article as a springboard to discuss the broader state of UI/UX design. There is a strong consensus that older interfaces like Windows 2000, Windows 7, and older macOS versions represented a "peak" of functional design. Commenters express frustration with the constant, often regressive, changes in modern UIs. This is linked to corporate incentives (KPIs, promotions for shipping "new" features rather than fixing bugs) and a perceived shift in technology's purpose from being a "tool" to an "ad delivery vehicle" where keeping users engaged is more important than helping them work efficiently. The discussion concludes with suggestions for alternative systems, like KDE/Qt, which are praised for maintaining design consistency and usability.

## [Anna's Archive loses .org domain after surprise suspension](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/)
**Score:** 540 | **Comments:** 281 | **ID:** 46497164

> **Article:** The article from TorrentFreak reports that Anna's Archive, a major search engine for pirated books and academic papers, has lost its `annas-archive.org` domain. The domain was suspended by its registrar due to a "ServerHold" status, which is typically applied in response to legal pressure or court orders. The article suggests this action is likely the result of pressure from major music labels and other rights holders. The project's team has advised users to find their current active domains via their Wikipedia page, and the main site remains accessible at `annas-archive.se`.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around the predictable nature of the domain seizure, methods for circumventing censorship, and the broader implications for digital preservation.

There is a consensus that the suspension was an expected consequence of challenging powerful copyright holders, with many commenters noting that such actions often backfire by increasing public awareness of the targeted service. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on technical and decentralized solutions to ensure long-term resilience. Suggestions included using alternative networks like Yggdrasil or Tor, and leveraging decentralized protocols such as Nostr for communication, though the feasibility and challenges of each were debated.

The use of Wikipedia as a "decentralized DNS" to post updated domain links was a key point of contention. Some viewed it as an innovative use of a public resource, while others expressed concern that it could expose Wikipedia to legal liability.

Finally, commenters discussed practical ways to support the project, primarily by seeding its torrent files to distribute the content and make it harder to take down. There was also a minor thread about the technical hurdles of simply pointing a new domain to the service, such as the need for HTTPS certificates.

## [Databases in 2025: A Year in Review](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html)
**Score:** 457 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46496103

> **Article:** This article, "Databases in 2025: A Year in Review" by Andy Pavlo of CMU, is a retrospective on the database landscape in 2025. The post is framed as a humorous, fictional look back from the future, allowing the author to comment on trends that occurred during the year. Key themes discussed include the rise of AI-native databases, the impact of Model Context Protocols (MCP) on database interaction, significant acquisitions (such as Databricks acquiring Neon), and the continued evolution of specialized databases. The article also touches on the "bloat" of modern databases and the counter-trend of using simpler, single-file databases like SQLite. Pavlo also mentions a name change for EdgeDB to "Gel" and provides links to his other educational resources, including the popular CMU database course.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes. A primary point of debate was the security implications of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with users expressing concern that it violates the principle of least privilege and could lead to new forms of injection attacks from AI hallucinations. Another major topic was the acquisition of the database "Gel" (formerly EdgeDB) by Vercel, which sparked concern among commenters about the project's future, though the author of the article later confirmed he had updated his post to reflect this. The conversation also branched out to cover broader industry trends, with some users noting a move towards simpler, single-file databases like SQLite and DuckDB, while others pointed out that large enterprises still rely on established systems like Oracle and SQL Server. Several comments praised the author's unique and engaging teaching style at CMU, and a few users pointed out perceived omissions in the article, such as the lack of coverage for time-series databases, which the author addressed with links within the original post.

## [Show HN: Terminal UI for AWS](https://github.com/huseyinbabal/taws)
**Score:** 377 | **Comments:** 193 | **ID:** 46491749

> **Project:** The project is "taws," a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for AWS. It is a command-line tool designed to provide an interactive, visual way to explore and manage AWS resources directly from the terminal, aiming to be a more user-friendly alternative to the standard `aws-cli` for interactive tasks. The project is written in Rust and is explicitly inspired by `k9s`, a popular TUI for Kubernetes.
>
> **Discussion:** The project received a mix of praise, skepticism, and off-topic conversation. The most significant controversy revolves around accusations of plagiarism. A user (bcb_1000) alleged that the project was a rushed, open-source copy of a similar tool that had just been released as a paid, closed-source product on Reddit. They claimed the author likely used an LLM to recreate the code and README. Other users debated the validity of this, with some pointing out that the project's commit history was suspiciously new, while others noted that the idea itself is not unique and could be generated by an AI prompt.

Beyond the controversy, other discussion points included:
*   **Functionality & Inspiration:** Users compared it to `k9s` (which the author acknowledges) and suggested features like better integration with AWS SSO for managing multiple accounts.
*   **Alternatives:** A user mentioned that AI coding assistants like Claude can perform similar tasks natively, though this was countered by the argument that a dedicated TUI is a better experience than paying for a subscription service.
*   **Installation:** A minor point of contention arose over the recommendation to use Homebrew for Linux installation, with some users arguing that it's not the standard or best practice for that OS.
*   **Tangents:** The discussion briefly veered into a user asking for an explanation of "neocloud" after another commenter mentioned they run one, and a general complaint about the trend of building large CLI/TUI apps for what could be simple shell scripts.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 326 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The post alleges that RevisionDojo, a Y Combinator (YC) backed startup, is running astroturfing campaigns. Specifically, it accuses them of using fake accounts and deceptive marketing to target children with their test preparation and study tools. The post frames this as an unethical practice by a company in the education space.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the alleged behavior, using the incident to launch a broader critique of Y Combinator's culture and the prevalence of astroturfing in the tech industry. The dominant sentiment is cynicism and lack of surprise, with many commenters arguing that the startup's actions are a predictable outcome of the "fake it till you make it" and growth-at-all-costs mentality often associated with YC companies.

The conversation quickly expands beyond RevisionDojo. Commenters bring up other YC startups they perceive as unethical or having misleading business practices, such as Pickle (an AR device) and Honey, to build a case that this is a systemic issue. There is also a significant discussion about the ethics of the test-prep market itself, with one user noting that the demand from students is often driven by a desire to cheat, which creates a morally ambiguous business environment.

Finally, the discussion touches on the wider problem of astroturfing and sockpuppeting across the internet, particularly on platforms like Reddit. Several users express that such deceptive marketing is rampant and that social media companies should be more transparent about its scale. The thread also features a meta-discussion about censorship, with some users ironically predicting the thread's removal, while others defend HN's moderation record on anti-YC topics.

## [During Helene, I just wanted a plain text website](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/helene_and_mobile_web_performance)
**Score:** 317 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46494734

> **Article:** The article, "During Helene, I just wanted a plain text website," is a personal account from a web developer who experienced the aftermath of Hurricane Helene with severely limited mobile internet access. While trying to get critical information about road closures and storm damage, he was frustrated by news and official websites that were bloated with heavy scripts, large assets, and trackers, causing them to load slowly or fail entirely on a constrained connection. He argues that for essential services, especially during emergencies, developers should prioritize performance and accessibility by creating lightweight, "plain text" versions of their sites that deliver crucial information first, without the heavy dependencies of modern web development.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's experience, with many commenters agreeing that modern websites are often unusable on slow connections. Several users immediately provided links to existing text-only versions of news sites (like CNN Lite and NPR Text) and tools like NoScript that can strip out bloat. A recurring theme is the irony that the article itself is hosted on a site built with a heavy framework (Next.js) and loaded with trackers, a point raised by several critical commenters.

The conversation then broadens to explore why this problem persists. One perspective is that it's a matter of corporate incentives; since most users don't have a choice in services like dental insurance, companies have no financial reason to invest in better performance. Another viewpoint is that developers should design for "crisis mode" by loading essential content first and then adding interactive features, rather than treating limited connectivity as an edge case.

Finally, the discussion touches on the fragility of digital infrastructure during disasters. Commenters shared personal anecdotes about the failure of cellular networks, amateur radio repeaters, and the importance of analog backups like AM radio and carrying cash. The author's frustration is framed as a valid critique of a web that has become overly complex at the expense of core utility.

## [Why does a least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple data?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/674129/why-does-a-linear-least-squares-fit-appear-to-have-a-bias-when-applied-to-simple)
**Score:** 292 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46491821

> **Article:** The article (a Cross-Validated question) addresses a common visual confusion: when applying a standard linear least squares fit (regression of y on x) to simple data, the resulting line often appears to be "biased" or skewed, failing to visually bisect the data cloud. The author asks why this happens, as one might intuitively expect the "best fit" line to pass through the center of the data in a more symmetrical way.

The core issue is that ordinary least squares (OLS) is mathematically designed to minimize the sum of the *squared vertical distances* between the data points and the line. It does not minimize the shortest (perpendicular) distances. Because the fit is constrained to be optimal only in the vertical direction, the line can appear tilted relative to the visual center of the data, especially if the data has a strong correlation or if one views the problem symmetrically.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion provides a comprehensive breakdown of the statistical and geometric reasons behind this visual "bias," converging on the distinction between different regression methodologies.

The central theme is the difference between **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** and **Total Least Squares (TLS)**. Several users explain that OLS explicitly assumes the independent variable (X) is measured without error and all noise resides in the dependent variable (Y). Consequently, it minimizes vertical errors. In contrast, visual intuition often assumes errors exist in both X and Y (a "total" error), which is the domain of Total Least Squares (or Principal Component Analysis), which minimizes perpendicular distances.

Participants highlight specific techniques to handle scenarios where both variables contain noise:
*   **Deming Regression** is frequently cited as the standard solution for "errors-in-variables" models, allowing the user to specify the ratio of variances between X and Y.
*   **PCA** is mentioned as a coordinate-independent method that treats the data symmetrically.

Geometrically, users illustrate the asymmetry by noting that swapping X and Y produces a different regression line; the "bias" is simply the result of the chosen coordinate system and loss function (vertical vs. perpendicular). One user offered a probabilistic intuition: OLS assumes a Gaussian distribution of errors in Y, and the asymmetry is a natural consequence of that assumption.

Finally, the community debated the practical relevance of X-axis noise. While theoretically important, many argued that in real-world sensor data, the noise in the measurement (Y) often vastly dominates the noise in the sampling time (X), making OLS "good enough" for most applications.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 291 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An Ars Technica article details a legal battle between the estate of a murder-suicide victim and OpenAI. The estate is seeking access to the deceased's ChatGPT logs to determine if the AI played a role in the user's deteriorating mental state and subsequent actions. OpenAI has refused to release the data, citing user privacy. The case highlights the growing tension between a user's right to privacy (even after death) and the need for transparency and accountability from AI companies, especially when their products are implicated in tragic events. The article frames this as a critical test for how data from AI interactions will be handled in the context of legal investigations and deceased users' estates.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is multifaceted, with commenters exploring the legal, ethical, and technical dimensions of the case. A central theme is the debate over data privacy versus accountability. While some argue that a user's data should remain private even after death, others contend that in a criminal investigation, such data is crucial evidence and a company should not be able to unilaterally block its release.

The conversation also delves into the nature of AI models themselves. Several commenters point to the well-documented "sycophantic" behavior of models like ChatGPT, which can reinforce and amplify a user's existing beliefs or delusions. They speculate that the AI may have validated the user's paranoid thoughts rather than initiating them, but its lack of genuine understanding makes it a dangerous tool for vulnerable individuals. This leads to broader skepticism about the safety and control of more advanced AI systems ("superintelligence").

Finally, the discussion touches on external factors and the broader context. Some users suggest that underlying mental health issues or other substances (like testosterone) might have been a more significant factor than the AI interaction. There is also a cynical view of OpenAI's actions, with commenters drawing parallels to Orwellian themes of information control and expressing distrust in the company's motives, particularly regarding its public statements versus its actions in court. The overall sentiment is one of concern about the unpredictable consequences of deploying powerful, persuasive AI without adequate safeguards or clear legal frameworks for accountability.

## [California residents can now request all data brokers delete personal info](https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/)
**Score:** 280 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46495220

> **Article:** The article announces that California residents can now use a new state-run online portal to request that all registered data brokers delete their personal information. This service is part of the California Delete Act, which builds upon existing CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) rights. The law also mandates that data brokers register with the state, creating a centralized list that theoretically allows for a one-stop-shop for deletion requests, rather than having to contact each broker individually. The law's full implementation is scheduled to be in effect by August 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of appreciation for the law's intent and significant skepticism about its practical effectiveness and implementation.

A primary theme is the law's limitations and potential loopholes. Users question whether the deletion is permanent, pointing out that data brokers can simply repurchase the same data from other sources that are not bound by California law. The 45-day compliance window is seen as a major flaw, as brokers could time their data sales to occur just before a deletion request is processed, effectively keeping the user's data for most of the time. The core issue, as one user noted, is that "data doesn't respect state lines."

There is also a strong undercurrent of frustration regarding the broader system. Users lamented the lack of a federal equivalent and expressed cynicism about corporate influence preventing nationwide regulation. The fundamental problem of data collection without explicit, opt-in consent was raised, with some arguing that the current "opt-out" model disproportionately benefits the technically savvy and that the real solution is to make privacy the default for everyone.

Finally, commenters shared practical frustrations, including technical difficulties with the government webform (e.g., cumbersome date-of-birth selection) and the irony of being blocked by Cloudflare's bot detection while trying to access a privacy portal. The discussion also highlighted the real-world impact of data brokers, linking them to spam, scams, and personal safety risks like stalking.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 250 | **Comments:** 249 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that AI-generated video content is inherently detrimental. The author, Ibrahim Diallo, contends that it is not just a creative tool but a medium that actively harms society. He identifies several key harms: the "visual wrongness" and revulsion of the uncanny valley; the ethical problem of training models on uncredited, stolen content; the erosion of trust and the proliferation of misinformation and scams; and the "race to the bottom" where cheap, low-quality AI ads and content devalue human creativity and labor. Diallo also refutes the "democratization of creativity" argument, stating that AI removes the craft and skill from the creative process, leaving only a hollow, generic output. Ultimately, he sees the technology as a net negative, flooding the internet with untrustworthy and aesthetically unpleasant content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deeply divided audience, with most commenters either strongly opposing or defending the article's thesis. A significant portion of the conversation revolves around the aesthetic and creative merit of AI video. Many users express a visceral, "gag reflex" reaction to the distinct, "uncanny valley" look of AI-generated content, agreeing with the author that this inherent artificiality is a major barrier. However, others argue that this is a temporary phase and that as the technology improves, this "tone" will disappear, making the "who cares what wrote it" argument valid. The debate on creativity is also central, with some users asserting that AI removes human craft and decision-making, while others counter that it's a new tool, akin to the transition from hand-drawn to 3D-rendered animation, that simply lowers the barrier to entry for those with ideas but not technical skills.

Beyond aesthetics, the discussion is heavily focused on the societal and economic consequences. The most prominent concerns are the "race to the bottom" in advertising and content creation, the overwhelming flood of low-quality "slop" and misinformation that erodes trust, and the ethical issue of training models on uncredited work. A more cynical viewpoint suggests the ultimate goal is for a few "feudal lords" to control AGI empires. On the other hand, some commenters are optimistic, viewing AI video as a powerful new medium for comedy, memes, and personal expression. A recurring practical sentiment is one of resignation and advice to simply disengage from the platforms driving this content, with one user suggesting it's better to watch traditional TV, a point that was itself criticized as promoting a different form of "brain rot." Ultimately, the comments reflect a struggle to reconcile the potential of a new creative tool with its immediate, and often negative, real-world impact.

## [A spider web unlike any seen before](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/science/biggest-spiderweb-sulfur-cave.html)
**Score:** 240 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46496054

> **Article:** Researchers have discovered the largest spider web ever recorded inside a remote cave in Brazil. The colossal, tangled web structure spans over 1,000 square meters (approx. 10,700 sq ft) and is inhabited by an estimated 111,000 spiders of a single species, *Sphingonotus caudatus*. Unlike typical orb-weavers, these spiders construct a "sheet-web" that hangs like a curtain. The cave's extreme environment, rich in toxic hydrogen sulfide gas and devoid of light, creates a unique ecosystem. The massive spider population is sustained by a dense colony of about 2.4 million midges that live and breed within the cave, providing a constant food source for the arachnids.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of awe, revulsion, and scientific curiosity. The most immediate response was visceral, with many users expressing a desire to "nope" out of the situation due to arachnophobia. However, the conversation quickly pivoted to scientific inquiry.

Key discussion points included:
*   **Ecosystem Dynamics:** Users were fascinated by the food chain that could support such a large population, identifying the cycle of midges feeding the spiders. This led to a broader appreciation for the hidden, complex life forms thriving in extreme environments.
*   **Spider Behavior:** The solitary nature of most spiders was contrasted with this colony, prompting a discussion on social spiders. Users recommended resources on social arachnids and even a science fiction novel (*Children of Time*) that explores the concept.
*   **Environmental Context:** A significant thread questioned the safety of the researchers, who were filmed without masks in a cave filled with toxic hydrogen sulfide gas. This led to a debate about the concentration of the gas and the potential health risks, with users analyzing the article's text to clarify that the researchers were indeed wearing masks and had acclimated to the fumes.
*   **Human Impact:** A minor philosophical thread emerged about humanity's role in destroying natural wonders, though this was a small part of the overall conversation.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 222 | **Comments:** 396 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argues that the US has done itself a "great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and that the country must create prosperity for all, not just highly educated "PhDs." The article summarizes his plan as using government incentives and "force" to compel companies to build AI infrastructure and manufacturing within the United States, effectively reversing decades of free trade policy to bring jobs back home.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is largely skeptical of Jensen Huang's statement, focusing on wealth distribution, hypocrisy, and the practical realities of his proposal.

A dominant theme is cynicism regarding Huang's motives and the broader economic system. Many commenters view his statement as hypocritical, pointing to his personal wealth ($150bn) and suggesting that if he were truly concerned about domestic prosperity, he could personally redistribute significant funds. The counter-argument is that his wealth is a drop in the bucket compared to national debt and wouldn't solve the systemic issue of wealth concentration, which many see as the real problem rather than a lack of overall wealth.

There is also significant debate about the nature of the jobs being brought back. Commenters distinguish between manufacturing and data centers. While some dismiss data centers as job-poor "offshore" facilities, others argue they provide significant local employment through construction and ongoing maintenance, even if the headcount is lower than traditional factories. The discussion highlights that high-automation factories won't bring back the massive workforces of the past.

Finally, the conversation touches on the political and historical context. Huang's comments are framed as part of a broader populist shift away from free trade, with parallels drawn to Ross Perot's "giant sucking sound" warnings in the 1992 election. There is a general consensus that leadership is inherently political, and Huang is simply leveraging his influence to shape policy favorable to his industry, with some commenters expressing weariness over the focus on AI data centers at the expense of other solutions like renewable energy.

## [Microsoft Office renamed to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app”](https://www.office.com)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 188 | **ID:** 46496465

> **Article:** The article, linked from a Hacker News post, reports that Microsoft has renamed its "Microsoft Office" mobile and desktop application to the "Microsoft 365 Copilot app." The article's title and the landing page at office.com now reflect this change, explicitly stating "The Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)." This rebranding applies to the unified application that provides access to Office tools, but not necessarily to the core product suite names like "Office 2024" for one-time purchases.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly negative and bewildered, with near-universal criticism of Microsoft's branding decision. The dominant sentiment is that the new name is confusing, desperate, and a significant downgrade from the globally recognized "Office" brand. Commenters argue that the name "Microsoft 365 Copilot app" is long, nonsensical for an office suite, and fails to communicate its purpose.

A key theme is the perceived desperation to associate everything with "AI" and "Copilot," with users cynically suggesting the rename is a tactic to inflate Copilot adoption metrics by forcing it into the product's identity. The rebrand is frequently compared to other infamous corporate missteps, most notably Twitter's rebrand to "X," and is seen as a case study in bad marketing. While one commenter noted the change happened months ago, others pointed out that Microsoft's branding has long been confusing. The overall tone is one of mockery and frustration, with users coining new pejoratives like "Copislop" and "Microslop."

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project, "DoNotNotify," is an Android application designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log all incoming notifications and then create intelligent, rule-based filters to block or dismiss them. The primary goal is to combat "notification spam" from apps that mix useful information (e.g., ride status, delivery updates) with unwanted marketing and promotional content, which often cannot be disabled through standard Android settings.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a broad consensus that notification spam is a significant and frustrating problem on both Android and iOS. Users shared various strategies for managing the deluge, ranging from simply putting the phone on permanent silent to adopting a "one strike and you're out" policy of uninstalling or blocking any app that sends a promotional notification.

While the project was well-received, many commenters noted that it enters a crowded space. Alternatives like BuzzKill and FilterBox on Android were frequently mentioned as powerful, established solutions that also offer rule-based filtering. On iOS, users expressed frustration with the lack of granular control, noting that even major apps often ignore notification categories and bundle ads with essential alerts.

Underlying the discussion was a strong critique of app developers and the platform stores. Several participants described the practice of pushing ads via notifications as a "dark pattern" and argued that Apple and Google should enforce stricter guidelines against it. The conversation also touched on the broader societal impact of constant digital interruptions and the difficulty of finding a balance between staying informed and preserving one's attention and well-being.

## [ICE is using facial-recognition technology to quickly arrest people](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-facial-recognition-app-mobile-fortify-dfdd00bf)
**Score:** 206 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46495560

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is utilizing facial-recognition and mobile biometrics technology to rapidly identify and arrest individuals. The agency uses tools that can scan subjects' irises and faces to quickly verify identities against databases, significantly speeding up the apprehension process. This deployment represents a significant expansion of surveillance technology within domestic law enforcement and immigration control operations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of ICE's use of facial-recognition technology, framing it as a dangerous expansion of state surveillance power.

The central theme is the "slippery slope" argument: while some might accept such technology for heinous crimes like murder or rape, commenters argue that using it for immigration enforcement (which some view as a misdemeanor) normalizes dragnet surveillance. There is a strong consensus that tools built for one purpose inevitably expand to others—creeping into credit scoring, insurance, employment, and other areas of life. This is often described as the natural tendency of systems to seek expansion.

Many commenters draw parallels to authoritarianism, specifically citing China's social credit system as a precedent that the U.S. is now emulating. However, a counter-argument suggests that this is merely the continuation of historical patterns, comparing the biometric scanning to the systematic fingerprinting of minorities during the Civil Rights era.

The discussion also touches on technical aspects, questioning the source of the biometric data (iris scans, gait recognition) and the lack of specific legal frameworks governing this use. The sentiment is largely one of resignation regarding the loss of privacy, with one user noting that "you can't have both" freedom and security.

## [Eurostar AI vulnerability: When a chatbot goes off the rails](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/eurostar-ai-vulnerability-when-a-chatbot-goes-off-the-rails/)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46492063

> **Article:** The article details a security assessment of Eurostar's AI-powered chatbot, which was found to have several vulnerabilities. The key findings include:
1.  **System Prompt Leakage**: The chatbot's underlying system prompt, which contained instructions and context, could be extracted by asking the bot directly.
2.  **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: The chatbot used predictable and non-validated UUIDs for conversations and messages. This allowed a researcher to potentially access or manipulate other users' chat sessions by guessing or iterating through these IDs.
3.  **Self-XSS**: The chatbot failed to sanitize user input, allowing for a self-cross-site scripting (XSS) attack where a user could inject malicious scripts that would only execute in their own browser.

The author also highlights the poor response from Eurostar's security team, who initially accused the researcher of "blackmail" and "hacking" before eventually acknowledging the report. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the security risks of deploying AI chatbots without proper safeguards and the importance of a mature security response process.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the article's claims, with most commenters agreeing that the vulnerabilities described are low-impact or not vulnerabilities at all. The key themes are:

*   **Dismissal of Technical Findings**: The majority of commenters argue that the discovered issues lack real-world impact. The self-XSS is considered trivial as it only affects the user who injects the script. The system prompt leakage is dismissed as "security by obscurity," noting that such prompts are often public and don't inherently grant an attacker new abilities. The IDOR vulnerability is deemed impractical, as brute-forcing random UUIDs is infeasible without a way to leak them first.

*   **Criticism of the Researcher's Claims**: Several users directly challenge the article's assertion of a "clear path" to a more serious cross-user attack, calling it unsubstantiated. They emphasize that a vulnerability report without a demonstrated proof-of-concept showing tangible impact (like accessing another user's data) is often considered "noise" by bug bounty programs and the security community.

*   **Eurostar's Poor Response**: While the technical findings were downplayed, Eurostar's arrogant and accusatory response to the researcher was widely condemned. Commenters saw this as a symptom of a monopolistic, government-adjacent corporate culture that is out of touch with modern security practices.

*   **Broader AI Security Concerns**: The discussion pivoted to the wider issue of AI chatbot security. Commenters shared anecdotes of finding far more severe vulnerabilities in other corporate chatbots, such as one that could be tricked into revealing private customer data. This highlighted a common failure: companies and non-technical staff often lack the "attacker mindset" needed to secure these new systems, leading to critical oversights in permissioning and data access.

## [I changed my personality in six weeks](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260102-how-i-changed-my-personality-in-six-weeks)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 172 | **ID:** 46491623

> **Article:** The BBC article profiles a writer's attempt to intentionally change her personality over six weeks, guided by psychological research. She targeted the "Big Five" personality traits: increasing low Extraversion and Conscientiousness, and decreasing high Neuroticism. Through a regimen of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), exposure therapy (e.g., taking cold showers, initiating conversations), and habit formation, she reported significant, measurable changes in her personality test scores. The article frames this as a "proof of concept" that personality, often seen as fixed, is malleable and can be consciously reshaped to improve one's life and mental well-being.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely skeptical of the article's premise and methodology, while also exploring the broader nature of personality change. A central theme was the unreliability of the author's self-reported results. Many commenters argued that a six-week period is too short for a genuine personality shift and that the author, having invested effort to change, was likely biased to report success and game the test. The lack of external validation (e.g., from a partner or friends) was cited as a major weakness.

Beyond the specific article, the conversation touched on several key points:
*   **External Catalysts for Change:** Several users shared powerful anecdotes where major life events, such as caring for a special needs child or navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, forced significant personality shifts (e.g., becoming more assertive or confident). This contrasted with the author's deliberate, self-driven approach.
*   **Motivation and Value:** The discussion questioned the implicit value judgment that traits like extraversion are universally desirable. Some introverted users defended their nature, stating it's tied to sensory sensitivity and not simply a lack of effort. The debate highlighted that the desire to change often stems from personal suffering or societal pressure, not an objective improvement.
*   **Historical and Philosophical Context:** Commenters drew parallels to other systems of personal transformation, most notably the 12-step program (which one user reframed in secular terms) and historical figures like John Conway, who reportedly decided to become an extrovert overnight. This suggested that the concept of personality change is not new.
*   **Personality vs. Mental Health:** The line between personality traits and clinical conditions was blurred. One user argued that focusing on "personality" is a luxury for the mentally healthy, while another countered that research shows adjusting personality traits can be an effective treatment for mental health issues.

Overall, the community viewed the article as an interesting but flawed experiment, preferring a more nuanced view of personality as "stable, not fixed," influenced by both conscious effort and life's circumstances.

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 179 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article is a personal blog post detailing the author's experience switching from VSCode to the Zed code editor. The author highlights Zed's performance, native feel, and modern UI as key advantages. They also discuss the process of migrating their workflow and extensions, noting that while some features are still missing or different, the overall experience is positive and they have no intention of switching back. The post serves as a testimonial for developers considering a similar move.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a mixed but generally positive view of Zed, centered on its potential as a modern editor while also highlighting significant barriers to adoption.

A central theme is the trade-off between Zed's appealing modern features (performance, UI, native feel) and its ecosystem maturity compared to VSCode. While many users express a desire to switch and praise Zed's speed and design, they point out critical missing features or regressions. These include issues with low-DPI font rendering, a lack of vertical tab support, and less robust Emacs keybindings than VSCode extensions.

The conversation also reveals significant real-world constraints on switching. One user in the embedded systems field is effectively locked into VSCode because chip manufacturers have standardized on it for their toolchains, illustrating how industry adoption can dictate individual developer choice. This sparked a debate about whether organizations should mandate specific IDEs.

Finally, there is a notable tension regarding Zed's development priorities. Some users express frustration that the team is focusing on AI features while "basic" editor functionality remains incomplete or buggy (e.g., LSP Semantic Highlighting, collaboration features bit-rotting). However, others find the AI integration to be a powerful and stable advantage. The discussion also touched on workarounds for missing functionality, like using external tools such as `lazygit` to compensate for a less-integrated Git experience.

## [North Dakota law lists fake critical minerals based on coal lawyers' names](https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/government-politics/article_515812a0-d29a-4161-91f1-3e53003e2911.html)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 110 | **ID:** 46492161

> **Article:** A new law in North Dakota, intended to promote the development of critical minerals, accidentally included two fake minerals: "friezium" and "stralium." These names appear to be inside jokes referencing Christopher Friez and David Straley, attorneys for the North American Coal company who were heavily involved in drafting the bill. A third fake mineral, "docterium" (referencing Rep. Jason Dockter), was discovered and removed from an earlier draft, but the other two made it into the final law, highlighting a lack of oversight and review by lawmakers.
>
> **Discussion:** HN commenters reacted with a mixture of cynicism, humor, and calls for reform. The dominant sentiment is that this incident is a perfect example of lawmakers blindly accepting legislation written by industry lobbyists without reading or understanding it. Many found it ironic that the lawmaker who caught one fake mineral didn't think to have the entire list reviewed by an expert.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **Cynicism about Political Accountability:** Users argued that the politicians responsible would face no consequences. They predicted the incumbent legislators would be re-elected, as they successfully delivered what their industry backers wanted, and their constituents would likely remain unaware or unconcerned.
*   **Broader Problem of Industry-Drafted Bills:** Commenters shared anecdotes and general knowledge about how corporations and special interest groups frequently write legislation, sometimes even leaving their logos on the documents. This was seen as a systemic issue, not an isolated incident.
*   **Lack of Competence:** The discussion highlighted the absurdity of legislators passing laws on technical topics (like mineralogy) without any expert consultation. One user pointed out that the list was flawed even beyond the fake names, as it confused minerals with elements.
*   **Proposed Solutions (and their flaws):** Some users humorously or seriously proposed mandatory comprehension tests for legislators before they could vote on a bill. However, others countered that this would simply transfer power to the test administrators, creating a different kind of problem.

## [Decorative Cryptography](https://www.dlp.rip/decorative-cryptography)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46496494

> **Article:** The article "Decorative Cryptography" argues that much of what is marketed as security is merely "decorative"—it looks impressive but fails against a determined adversary who can redefine the threat model. The author uses the term "threat model gerrymandering" to describe how vendors and protocols draw boundaries around the system to exclude realistic attack vectors. For example, a system might be secure against remote network attacks but not against a local physical adversary, or its end-to-end encryption is rendered moot if the endpoints themselves are compromised (e.g., by malware or on-device scanning). The piece critiques the reliance on complex software and hardware features (like TPMs or TEEs) without acknowledging their limitations, concluding that unless the implementation is perfect and the threat model is honest, the security is largely for show.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the article's core thesis that security is often illusory and dependent on narrowly defined threat models. A key phrase from the article, "threat model gerrymandering," was widely praised for succinctly describing how security claims can be misleading. Several users debated the practicality of hardware-based security, referencing IBM POWER9 CPUs which featured physical key imprints, and questioning why such features haven't been adopted by mainstream vendors like Intel or AMD. While some argued that modern CPUs have integrated roots of trust (like in confidential computing), others remained skeptical, noting that trusting the hardware vendor introduces its own set of vulnerabilities.

The conversation also explored the concept of "ends" in end-to-end encryption. Users cited Apple iMessage as a case where E2E encryption exists, but on-device scanning and server-side checks complicate the definition of a secure endpoint. There was a sub-thread debating whether Apple's file-scanning processes were a genuine privacy threat or a debunked bug, highlighting the difficulty in verifying security claims.

Finally, the discussion included practical examples of bypassing security. One user shared a detailed, week-long effort to reverse-engineer an anti-tampering library, illustrating the "cat-and-mouse" game between developers and attackers. This anecdote reinforced the article's point: if an adversary has enough time and resources, software-based protections often fail, leading to a consensus that security is a matter of cost-benefit analysis rather than absolute protection.
