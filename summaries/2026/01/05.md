## [It's hard to justify Tahoe icons](https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/)
**Score:** 1970 | **Comments:** 766 | **ID:** 46497712

> **Article:** The article "It's hard to justify Tahoe icons" by Anton Troynikov argues that Apple's recent UI changes, specifically the inconsistent and poorly aligned icons in the menus of macOS Tahoe, represent a significant regression in user interface design. He contrasts this with the clean, predictable, and functional UI of older systems like Windows 2000. The author meticulously documents how the new icons are misaligned, visually noisy, and fail to provide the quick scannability that icons are meant for. The core argument is that this isn't just an aesthetic issue; it's a failure of usability, where design choices prioritize a "look" over function, making the OS harder to use.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by a central irony pointed out by numerous commenters: the author's blog post about distracting UI clutter is itself presented with a full-screen, animated snow effect that many find difficult to read through. This sparked a sub-thread about the nature of personal websites versus corporate products, with some defending the author's right to have "fun" on their own site, while others see it as hypocritical. Despite this, many commenters agree with the article's core premise, lamenting the decline of UI/UX quality. This sentiment is broadened to a general critique of modern software design, with users pointing to Windows 2000/XP and KDE as examples of superior, function-first interfaces. The conversation also touches on potential reasons for this decline, such as corporate incentives (KPIs, promotions) that favor constant change over stability and bug-fixing, and the idea that as computers have become necessities, there is less pressure to resist "enshittification."

## [Anna's Archive loses .org domain after surprise suspension](https://torrentfreak.com/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-after-surprise-suspension/)
**Score:** 582 | **Comments:** 300 | **ID:** 46497164

> **Article:** The article from TorrentFreak reports that Anna's Archive, a major search engine for pirated books and academic papers, has lost its primary `annas-archive.org` domain. The domain was suspended unexpectedly with a "ServerHold" status, a measure typically used by registries during legal disputes. The suspension is widely believed to be the result of pressure from major music labels and other rights holders. The article notes that the site remains accessible via its `.se` domain and other mirrors, and the team advises users to check their Wikipedia page for updated domain information, a practice that itself has become a point of discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the nature of the attack, strategies for resilience, and the broader implications for digital preservation.

There was a consensus that the domain suspension was a predictable consequence of Anna's Archive's mission to challenge large copyright-holding industries. Users noted that such actions often serve as "great publicity," inadvertently increasing awareness and traffic for the targeted service.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on decentralized and censorship-resistant alternatives. Suggestions included using alternative top-level domains, Tor `.onion` addresses, and more advanced peer-to-peer technologies like Yggdrasil, BitTorrent (with users encouraged to seed content), and the Nostr protocol. However, participants also acknowledged the practical challenges of these methods, such as network capacity and the difficulty of achieving widespread adoption.

Finally, the discussion touched upon the technical and legal mechanisms at play. Users analyzed the `serverHold` status and its use in legal disputes. A debate emerged about the strategy of using Wikipedia as a "de facto DNS" to share updated links, with some defending it as standard informational practice while others warned it could expose Wikipedia to legal liability. The conversation also highlighted concerns about the potential for centralized platforms like Nostr to be used for spam and the importance of scrutinizing the creators of new technologies.

## [Databases in 2025: A Year in Review](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html)
**Score:** 496 | **Comments:** 145 | **ID:** 46496103

> **Article:** This article is a fictional "Year in Review" for the database world in 2025, written by Andy Pavlo of CMU. It humorously predicts major trends, including the rise of "AI-Native Databases" that integrate with LLMs via protocols like MCP, the "Great Unbundling" of monolithic databases into specialized microservices, and the dominance of "Serverless-First" architectures. It also playfully invents new database categories like "Probabilistic Databases" and "Mood Databases," and features a mock interview with a sentient database. The post is a satirical take on the current hype and rapid evolution in the database landscape.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on several key themes. A major point of concern was the security of AI-integration protocols like MCP, with users arguing that providing LLMs with broad database access violates the principle of least privilege and could lead to new forms of data injection from model hallucinations. Another significant topic was the fate of the database "Gel" (formerly EdgeDB), whose acquisition by Vercel sparked debate about its future, though the original author later corrected the post to clarify it wasn't being discontinued. The conversation also branched out into the author's unique and engaging teaching style at CMU, with many commenters sharing links to his popular database course videos. Finally, several users pointed out perceived omissions in the article, such as the lack of coverage for time-series databases, SQLite, and immutable/bi-temporal databases, leading to a broader debate on the relevance of established vs. emerging database technologies.

## [Murder-suicide case shows OpenAI selectively hides data after users die](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/openai-refuses-to-say-where-chatgpt-logs-go-when-users-die/)
**Score:** 384 | **Comments:** 222 | **ID:** 46499983

> **Article:** An article from Ars Technica details a legal case where the family of a murder-suicide victim is suing OpenAI. The lawsuit alleges that the victim's interactions with ChatGPT contributed to his deteriorating mental state, culminating in the tragedy. The central issue highlighted is OpenAI's refusal to provide the deceased user's chat logs to the family for use as evidence, citing privacy policies. The case raises significant questions about data privacy after death, a company's responsibility for user safety, and the legal obligations of tech firms to release user data in the context of criminal or civil investigations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with commenters expressing a range of skepticism, concern, and analysis. A dominant theme is skepticism about placing the blame solely on AI. Several users pointed to other potential contributing factors, such as the victim's reported use of testosterone, arguing that these "idiosyncratic" cases are more complex than a simple "AI gone rogue" narrative. This skepticism was extended with a call for more context, questioning whether the user had framed the conversation as fictional or if the AI truly went "off the rails" unprompted.

Another major thread focused on the broader implications of AI design and corporate responsibility. Commenters referenced other instances of AI "sycophancy" and dangerous behavior, suggesting this is a known and potentially systemic issue. The company's name, "OpenAI," was ironically contrasted with its refusal to release the data, with some users making direct comparisons to Orwellian themes of doublespeak. A key point of debate was the tension between data privacy and the need for evidence, with one user noting they want their data guarded jealously, even from family after death, while others argued that a company should not be able to withhold evidence in a trial.

Finally, the discussion broadened to the fundamental safety and regulation of advanced AI. Commenters questioned how a company that can't make a "simple chatbot safe" expects to build "superintelligence," expressing deep pessimism about the industry's ability to self-regulate or create safe systems. The difficulty of regulating potentially harmful technology was also debated, with some arguing that banning things with "potential for harm" is impractical, while others implied that current regulatory frameworks are inadequate for the unique challenges posed by AI.

## [RevisionDojo, a YC startup, is running astroturfing campaigns targeting kids](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46499976)
**Score:** 370 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46499976

> **Article:** The article (likely from a source like 404 Media, based on comments) exposes RevisionDojo, a startup backed by Y Combinator (YC), for allegedly running astroturfing campaigns. The practice involves creating fake online personas and posting deceptive promotional content to market their product. The specific target of these campaigns appears to be children and students, likely to promote study aids or "cheat sheets."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mixture of cynicism, condemnation, and calls to action. The prevailing sentiment is that this behavior, while unethical, is not surprising for a YC-backed startup. Many commenters argue that the "fake it till you make it" and aggressive growth-hacking culture prevalent in Silicon Valley inevitably leads to fraud.

The discussion quickly broadened from RevisionDojo to a wider critique of Y Combinator and the startup ecosystem, with users citing other controversial YC companies (such as Pickle and Honey) to support the argument that the accelerator has a problem with vetting or encouraging unethical behavior.

There was also a significant tangent regarding the ethics of the test-prep industry itself. One commenter noted that the market for high school study tools is heavily driven by a demand for cheating, suggesting RevisionDojo's product fits into a pre-existing, morally gray market.

Finally, the conversation touched upon the prevalence of astroturfing and sockpuppeting on the internet in general, with users pointing out that it is a long-standing issue on platforms like Reddit and even referencing the site's own founders using fake accounts in its early days. A few users also suggested reporting the startup to regulatory bodies like the FTC.

## [During Helene, I just wanted a plain text website](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/helene_and_mobile_web_performance)
**Score:** 322 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46494734

> **Article:** The article, "During Helene, I just wanted a plain text website," is a personal account from a web developer who experienced the aftermath of Hurricane Helene with severely limited mobile internet access. Frustrated by news and information websites that were slow to load, unresponsive, or completely broken on his connection, he argues for a return to simpler, more performant web design. He contends that while modern web technologies offer rich interactivity, they often create a poor user experience for those in low-bandwidth situations, which are common during emergencies. The author's core plea is for developers and organizations, especially those providing critical information, to prioritize basic accessibility and performance over complex, heavy features, suggesting that a "plain text" or lightweight version of a site is essential for crisis communication.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the article's core theme: the web's growing bloat and its failure to serve users in low-connectivity or emergency situations. Many commenters agreed with the author's premise, sharing their own frustrations and proposing solutions. A significant portion of the conversation focused on existing alternatives and technical fixes. Users pointed to "lite" or text-only versions of major news sites (like CNN and NPR) and tools like NoScript to block bloat. Others mentioned RSS as a long-lost ideal for efficient information delivery and suggested that CMSs should normalize offering text-only versions as a standard feature.

However, the discussion also included strong counterarguments and critiques. One prominent critique was the irony that the author's own website was not a model of lean performance, being built with Next.js and loading numerous trackers. Another perspective argued that designing for "edge cases" like a hurricane is impractical and that the economic incentives for most companies to fix poor mobile experiences are non-existent, as users rarely have a choice (e.g., with employer-provided insurance).

Finally, the conversation broadened to include related topics of resilience in emergencies. Commenters drew parallels to the reliability of older technologies like AM radio, shared personal stories of communication breakdowns during past disasters, and offered practical advice on preparedness, such as carrying cash and having backup mobile carriers. A particularly poignant comment detailed a user's disillusionment with the ham radio community's failure to prioritize emergency communication, reinforcing the article's central point about the importance of designing systems for critical needs.

## [California residents can now request all data brokers delete personal info](https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/)
**Score:** 286 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46495220

> **Article:** The article announces a new official California government portal that allows residents to request that all registered data brokers delete their personal information. This platform streamlines the process created by existing California law (the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA), which already granted residents the right to have their data removed. A key component of the law is that data brokers must register with the state, making it possible for residents to submit a single request to have their information removed from all registered brokers at once.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the practical effectiveness, usability, and broader context of the new portal. While some users clarified that the deletion right itself isn't new, they acknowledged the portal simplifies the process. A major theme was skepticism about the law's long-term impact. Commenters questioned how residents could ensure their data stays deleted, especially since data brokers can recollect information from other sources that aren't bound by California law. There was concern that the 45-day processing window could be easily exploited, with brokers timing data purchases to fall just outside the deletion period.

Users also expressed frustration with the portal's technical usability, citing issues like a cumbersome date-of-birth selector and being blocked by Cloudflare. The conversation broadened to the fundamental ethics of data collection, with many arguing that the current "opt-out" system is flawed and that privacy should be the default. Finally, there was a strong sentiment of resignation regarding the possibility of federal privacy legislation, with many believing it is politically impossible.

## [All AI Videos Are Harmful (2025)](https://idiallo.com/blog/all-ai-videos-are-harmful)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 285 | **ID:** 46498651

> **Article:** The article "All AI Videos Are Harmful" argues that the proliferation of AI-generated video is a net negative for society. The author, Ibrahim Diallo, contends that these videos are not a form of creative expression but rather a form of "theft," created by models trained on uncredited, copyrighted human work. He describes the aesthetic of AI video as a "new uncanny valley" that inspires revulsion due to its subtle wrongness. Diallo also points to the negative societal impacts, including the erosion of trust, the potential for mass-scale misinformation and propaganda, and the "race to the bottom" in creative industries as companies opt for cheap, soulless AI content over human craftsmanship. He concludes that there is no easy solution and that the only viable response is for individuals to become more skeptical of online content and reduce their consumption of it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and multifaceted debate over the value and impact of AI-generated video. While many commenters share the author's revulsion, the conversation explores several distinct themes.

A primary point of agreement is the visceral negative reaction to the "AI aesthetic." Multiple users describe a "gag reflex" or feeling of "sickness" when encountering AI video, which they see as an evolutionarily adaptive defense mechanism against unnatural or deceptive content. However, there is a counterpoint that this is a temporary phenomenon; once the technology improves and the "uncanny valley" is crossed, this aversion may disappear, forcing a re-evaluation of content based purely on its information value.

The debate over "creativity" and "art" is central. One side argues that AI tools are not enabling creativity but are actively removing it from the process, as the AI makes the key aesthetic and structural decisions. This is contrasted with the view that new technologies, like 3D rendering replacing hand-drawn animation, are often initially dismissed but can become valid artistic mediums, especially when used by skilled artists who guide the tool. A key distinction is made between low-effort "slop" and high-effort projects where human creativity is still paramount (e.g., scripting, editing, acting).

The most urgent concerns raised are not about art but about societal harm. Commenters worry about the "flood of garbage" and misinformation that erodes trust and makes it impossible to distinguish fact from fiction. This is linked to the potential for AI-driven propaganda to manipulate public opinion and voting patterns. The economic impact is also a major theme, with a "race to the bottom" in advertising and content creation, where the drive to cut costs results in jarring, low-quality content.

Finally, the discussion touches on the motivations behind AI development, with one user suggesting the ultimate goal for some is to achieve AGI and become "feudal lords" over AI empires that don't need humans. A pragmatic suggestion offered is to simply disengage from the internet, but this is immediately countered by the argument that the real-world political and social consequences of AI-driven disinformation cannot be ignored.

## [A spider web unlike any seen before](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/science/biggest-spiderweb-sulfur-cave.html)
**Score:** 260 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46496054

> **Article:** The New York Times reports on the discovery of the world's largest spider web, located inside a remote, pitch-black cave in the Amazon. The web spans hundreds of feet and is inhabited by an estimated 111,000 social spiders of a single species. The cave is an extreme environment, filled with toxic hydrogen sulfide gas that keeps most predators away. The massive colony survives on a thriving ecosystem within the cave, feeding on millions of midges that are drawn to the cave entrance and become trapped in the web. This discovery highlights a unique, self-sustaining micro-ecosystem and challenges the typical view of spiders as solitary creatures.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was a mix of genuine curiosity, humor, and typical HN tangents. The initial reaction for many was one of shock or fear ("Nope! TF out"), though this quickly gave way to fascination. Key points of inquiry included:
*   **Ecological Sustainability:** Users were immediately curious about what could support such a massive population. The provided answer—that the spiders feed on millions of midges—led to a follow-up question about what sustains the midges, prompting the observation that life is "jam packed" everywhere.
*   **Spider Behavior:** The social nature of this colony was a major topic. One user incorrectly assumed spiders were solitary, which was corrected by others pointing to the existence of hundreds of social spider species. A recommendation for the sci-fi book *Children of Time* was also made in this context.
*   **Safety and Environment:** A minor debate arose regarding the safety of the researchers. One user questioned why they weren't wearing masks in a toxic hydrogen sulfide environment, but was corrected by another who pointed out the article explicitly stated they were wearing masks and that the gas concentration was survivable (though foul-smelling).
*   **Meta-Discussion:** As is common on HN, there was a technical discussion about the limitations of the archive.today service in preserving the article's embedded video.

## [Microsoft Office renamed to “Microsoft 365 Copilot app”](https://www.office.com)
**Score:** 245 | **Comments:** 204 | **ID:** 46496465

> **Article:** The article (linked from the office.com URL) announces that Microsoft has renamed its "Microsoft Office" mobile and desktop application to the "Microsoft 365 Copilot app." The title on the landing page explicitly states, "Welcome to the Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with immediate skepticism and derision toward the rebrand. The prevailing sentiment is that the new name is confusing, desperate, and a significant downgrade from the globally recognized "Office" brand. Commenters argued that the new title—containing "Microsoft," "365," "Copilot," and "app"—fails to clearly communicate that the software is an office suite.

Several key themes emerged in the discussion:
*   **Brand Dilution vs. AI Hype:** Users believe Microsoft is sacrificing a universally understood brand name solely to capitalize on the "AI" buzzword. Some cynically suggested the rename is a tactic to artificially inflate Copilot adoption statistics by counting standard Office usage.
*   **Confusion and Clarity:** While some noted that this specific rename applies primarily to the mobile app interface (not the subscription service itself), others pointed out that the distinction is not obvious to the average user. The general consensus is that Microsoft’s branding strategy has become increasingly opaque.
*   **Historical Comparisons:** The move was frequently compared to other infamous rebrands, most notably Twitter changing to X, with users predicting it will serve as a case study in marketing failures.
*   **Corporate Strategy:** A few users analyzed this as a shift in corporate strategy where companies no longer sell products to consumers but rather signal their status as "AI leaders" to investors.

## [Show HN: DoNotNotify – log and intelligently block notifications on Android](https://donotnotify.com/)
**Score:** 245 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46499646

> **Project:** The project, "DoNotNotify," is an Android application designed to give users granular control over their notifications. It allows users to log all incoming notifications and then create intelligent, rule-based filters to block or dismiss them. The primary goal is to combat "notification spam"—specifically, marketing and promotional messages that apps push through channels intended for functional alerts (e.g., a ride-sharing app sending a discount offer in the same notification channel as "your driver has arrived"). The app aims to solve the problem of essential apps becoming a source of unwanted attention-stealing alerts.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a widespread frustration with notification spam from major apps like Uber, Facebook, and various delivery services. Users are annoyed that companies mix functional alerts with marketing messages, often ignoring Android's notification categories. While some users manage this by simply turning off notifications from offending apps or putting their phone on permanent silent, many find this impractical for essential services.

DoNotNotify is seen as a welcome solution, especially its rule-based filtering, which complements Android's native controls. It enters a competitive space with existing, well-regarded apps like BuzzKill and FilterBox, which offer similar functionality. A key technical limitation noted is that the app cannot dismiss "persistent" notifications, which are a common workaround used by some apps to ensure their alerts remain visible. The conversation also broadened into a critique of "dark patterns" in app design and a call for app stores to enforce better notification hygiene, with iOS users noting the problem is just as bad on their platform due to a lack of granular notification channels.

## [Jensen: 'We've done our country a great disservice' by offshoring](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36862423/weve-done-our-country-a-great-disservice-by-offshoring-nvidias-jensen-huang-says-we-have-to-create-prosperity-for-all-not-just-phds)
**Score:** 236 | **Comments:** 421 | **ID:** 46498309

> **Article:** NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang argued that the US has "done our country a great disservice" by offshoring manufacturing and that the nation must create prosperity for all, not just highly educated elites. He outlined a plan to bring manufacturing jobs back to America by using policy to "force" companies to build AI infrastructure within the country. This involves a mix of tariffs, laws, and subsidies to shift investment away from free trade and toward domestic construction.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely focused on skepticism regarding Huang's motives and the feasibility of his proposals. The most prominent theme was wealth inequality; many commenters argued that the problem isn't a lack of wealth creation, but distribution, pointing to Huang's personal net worth (estimated at $150bn) as evidence that CEOs are hoarding resources rather than sharing prosperity with workers. There was also significant cynicism regarding the "we" in Huang's statement, with users suggesting he is deflecting blame from corporate leadership onto the general system or government.

Debate also arose over the actual economic benefits of the infrastructure Huang is proposing. While Huang focuses on bringing jobs back, users noted that modern AI data centers provide far fewer jobs than traditional manufacturing (50-100 vs. 200-5000), and that the wealth generated remains concentrated at the top. Some users defended data centers, noting they bring infrastructure and jobs to rural areas, but the prevailing sentiment was that this is a strategy to secure government subsidies and maintain the "line going up" rather than a genuine attempt to help the working class. Finally, some commenters drew parallels to Ross Perot's 1992 warnings about the "giant sucking sound" of jobs leaving the country, validating the concern while remaining doubtful about corporate leadership's willingness to solve it.

## [X blames users for Grok-generated CSAM; no fixes announced](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/x-blames-users-for-grok-generated-csam-no-fixes-announced/)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 404 | **ID:** 46503199

> **Article:** An article on Ars Technica reports that X (formerly Twitter) is blaming its users for generating Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) using its AI chatbot, Grok. The company's official statement from "X Safety" warns that users who prompt Grok to create illegal content will face the same consequences as those who upload it. However, the article notes that X has not announced any technical fixes to prevent Grok from generating such material in the first place. The piece highlights the platform's controversial stance of shifting responsibility onto its user base rather than implementing safeguards on its own AI model.
>
> **Discussion:** Discussion unavailable.

## [ICE is using facial-recognition technology to quickly arrest people](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/ice-facial-recognition-app-mobile-fortify-dfdd00bf)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46495560

> **Article:** The Wall Street Journal article reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been using advanced facial recognition and mobile biometric technology, including gait and iris scanning, to rapidly identify and arrest individuals. The article details the deployment of mobile apps that allow agents to capture biometric data in the field and cross-reference it with vast databases, significantly accelerating the arrest process for immigration violations. This technological expansion is part of a broader trend of increased surveillance capabilities within the agency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of ICE's use of facial recognition technology, framing it as a dangerous expansion of state surveillance power. The central theme is the "slippery slope" argument: tools justified for controlling immigration today will inevitably be used for more severe crimes and broader societal control tomorrow. Commenters express concern that this technology will drift into areas like credit scoring, hiring, and policing of other offenses, creating a permanent infrastructure of surveillance that cannot be easily undone.

Many users draw parallels to the surveillance state in China, noting the irony that what was once condemned abroad is now becoming routine domestically. The debate also touches on the historical context of biometric surveillance, with one user comparing it to the systematic fingerprinting of Black citizens during the Civil Rights era. There is a recurring discussion about the classic trade-off between security and liberty, with most commenters arguing that sacrificing privacy for perceived safety is a poor and irreversible bargain. A minor technical thread questioned the sources of data for iris and gait recognition, highlighting the opaque nature of these systems.

## [There were BGP anomalies during the Venezuela blackout](https://loworbitsecurity.com/radar/radar16/)
**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46504963

> **Article:** The article analyzes BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing anomalies that occurred during the February 2019 power blackout in Venezuela. The author, using data from Cloudflare Radar, observes that shortly before and during the outage, Venezuelan internet traffic was briefly re-routed through providers in the United States and other countries, specifically through networks like Sparkle (an Italian telecom). The article suggests this was not a random technical failure but a deliberate "hijack" of Venezuela's internet traffic. This manipulation likely served to either monitor data, disrupt connectivity, or create a "man-in-the-middle" scenario for Venezuelan internet users. The timing and nature of the routing changes point to a sophisticated cyber-operation coinciding with the physical infrastructure failure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the implications of using BGP manipulation as a tool of geopolitical warfare. Commentators widely agree that the event appears to be a deliberate US-led cyber-operation, with many expressing awe or concern over the sophistication of the capabilities demonstrated. There is a debate on the intent: some suggest the routing changes were for surveillance (spying on traffic without physical access), while others theorize the BGP anomalies were merely a side effect of physical attacks on power infrastructure that disrupted network timing and routing.

The conversation quickly pivots to the broader vulnerability of the internet's infrastructure. Several users note that BGP is fundamentally insecure and that this incident highlights how easily chaos can be sown. There is also a discussion on the history of disabling power grids, referencing graphite bombs used in past conflicts, and the terrifying prospect of "turning off" a nation's internet indefinitely. The consensus is that this event serves as a stark warning about the reliance on centralized, American-controlled technology and the inevitability of cyber-warfare in modern conflicts.

## [I switched from VSCode to Zed](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/i-switched-from-vscode-to-zed/)
**Score:** 176 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46498735

> **Article:** The article is a personal testimonial from a developer who switched from VSCode to Zed, a modern, GPU-accelerated code editor. The author highlights several key reasons for the switch, focusing on performance, user experience, and specific features. Key benefits mentioned include Zed's incredible speed and responsiveness (especially for tasks like find-and-replace), its clean and thoughtfully designed user interface, excellent out-of-the-box experience for languages like Rust and TypeScript, and built-in, first-class collaboration tools. The author also praises its integrated AI features and debugger. While acknowledging that Zed is still under active development and may lack some extensions or features found in more mature editors, the overall tone is highly positive, concluding that Zed has become their preferred daily driver.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion provides a multifaceted view of the current state of Zed, balancing its modern appeal against practical adoption hurdles. A central theme is the editor's performance and polished UI, with many users expressing their love for its speed and design. However, this praise is tempered by several recurring concerns.

A significant point of contention is platform and hardware support. Multiple users report issues with low-DPI monitor rendering, making the editor look "bad" on older or standard-resolution displays, while others express concern over the strict GPU requirement, which is problematic for remote development or virtualized environments. The lack of Linux support is also a major blocker for many, though the discussion notes that it is in active development.

For users considering a switch, the biggest barrier is often ecosystem lock-in. While individuals find the switch easy, organizations are seen as being too tied to the VSCode extension ecosystem. This is especially true in specialized fields like embedded systems, where chip manufacturers have standardized on VSCode as a platform for their toolchains. On the other hand, some users are actively trying to move away from Eclipse-based IDEs in that same field.

Feature parity is another key discussion point. Users express a desire for specific workflows, such as vertical tabs or better Emacs keybindings, and some are waiting for core features like LSP Semantic Highlighting before they can even evaluate the editor. The discussion also touches on the development priorities, with some users wishing for a focus on basic editor features over the heavily marketed AI capabilities, though others find the AI integration useful. Finally, there are reports of bugs, including high CPU usage and crashes, indicating that while stable for many, it is not yet flawless.

## [Show HN: Tailsnitch – A security auditor for Tailscale](https://github.com/Adversis/tailsnitch)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 18 | **ID:** 46501137

> **Project:** Tailsnitch is a security auditing tool for Tailscale networks, designed to act as a linter for Tailscale configurations. It analyzes ACLs (Access Control Lists) and other settings via the Tailscale API to identify potential security misconfigurations, overly permissive rules, and other risks. The tool is intended to help administrators manage the growing complexity of Tailscale setups, especially in larger teams and production environments, by providing a way to programmatically validate security posture and integrate checks into CI/CD pipelines.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted positively to Tailsnitch, seeing it as a valuable solution for a real-world problem: the growing complexity and "fear" of managing large Tailscale ACL files. Users expressed anxiety about making simple mistakes that could lead to significant security exposure, and the tool's ability to run in CI/CD was highlighted as a major benefit.

Several key themes emerged from the discussion:

*   **Native Functionality & Enterprise Needs:** A prominent point was the expectation that Tailscale itself should offer this functionality natively. Users argued that a "scan now" button, point-in-time reports, and an API for compliance evidence (for frameworks like SOC2) would be a natural and highly valuable addition for their enterprise customers.
*   **Security of the Tool:** One commenter humorously but critically pointed out the irony of a security tool requiring users to disable macOS security features (`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine`) to run it. This sparked a brief sub-thread about the risks of running such tools directly on a host versus in a sandboxed VM.
*   **Broader Use Cases & Feature Requests:** The discussion also explored adjacent ideas. One user wished for live audit logging of SSH connections (e.g., who logged into an admin account), a feature more aligned with tools like Teleport. Another requested the ability to add custom, user-defined security rules to the auditor. The project's compatibility with Headscale (an open-source Tailscale control server) was also questioned.
*   **Validation of a Problem:** The tool was seen as validation of the challenges of scaling a "permission mesh" like Tailscale beyond a small, competent team, where the risk of human error in complex configurations becomes a significant concern.

## [Decorative Cryptography](https://www.dlp.rip/decorative-cryptography)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 46496494

> **Article:** The article "Decorative Cryptography" argues that much of the security we rely on is illusory, serving as "security theater" rather than providing genuine protection. The author posits that security features often fail because they are designed for an idealized threat model that doesn't account for a determined, physical adversary. The article uses the example of an IBM POWER9 CPU, which had physical key imprints that could be photographed and extracted, to illustrate how hardware-based security can be defeated. It also critiques software encryption, noting that it's only as secure as the underlying system, and that features like Apple's on-device content scanning blur the lines of "end-to-end" encryption. The core message is that if an adversary has physical access or sufficient resources, many security measures become merely "decorative."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the article's core premise: the difficulty of achieving true security against a capable adversary. A key phrase that resonated with commenters was "threat model gerrymandering," describing how vendors define security in a way that conveniently excludes powerful attackers like the vendor themselves or a physical adversary.

The conversation branched into several key areas:
*   **Hardware vs. Software Security:** A debate emerged on whether security should be rooted in hardware or software. Some argued that integrated hardware roots of trust (like TPMs in the CPU) are essential to prevent physical tampering (e.g., bus interposers). However, others countered that this requires trusting the CPU vendor, who could themselves be a malicious actor. The IBM POWER9 feature was cited as a neat idea that, unfortunately, never became mainstream.
*   **The Limits of Practical Security:** Commenters shared anecdotes of bypassing complex software protections, such as anti-tampering libraries and memory checksums, reinforcing the article's point that determined reverse engineers can almost always find a way in. This led to a discussion on whether uncrackable software is possible, with the consensus being that it's only feasible when paired with secure, locked-down hardware (like a YubiKey).
*   **Real-World Examples and Skepticism:** The discussion used Apple's iMessage and on-device scanning as a case study. While one commenter raised this as an example of "decorative" E2E encryption, others pushed back, noting that the specific claims had been largely debunked or explained as a bug, highlighting the difficulty of proving malicious intent even when suspicious activity is observed.

Overall, the discussion affirmed the article's thesis, exploring the practical and philosophical challenges of building systems that are secure against a resourceful and persistent adversary.

## [CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it (2022)](https://idiallo.com/blog/learn-css)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46500022

> **Article:** The article "CSS sucks because we don't bother learning it" argues that developers' frustration with CSS stems from a fundamental lack of understanding of its core principles. The author posits that instead of learning the language's powerful native features, developers rely on "hacks" and heavy-handed frameworks like Tailwind. This creates a negative feedback loop: developers write convoluted, non-semantic HTML because they don't know how to use CSS selectors and the box model effectively, and then justify tools that further abstract them from the language, perpetuating the cycle of ignorance and complexity.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise but adds significant nuance, centering on whether the problem is the developer or the language itself. A dominant theme is that while developers often fail to learn CSS fundamentals, the language is also genuinely difficult and flawed. Commenters point to its lack of composability (global scope), counter-intuitive behaviors (described as "hacks on top of hacks"), and a constant need to track evolving standards and browser compatibility as major pain points. This makes it a poor fit for developers who aren't specialists.

The debate over tools like Tailwind is a central conflict. Some see it as a "symptom" of poor CSS knowledge, while others defend it as a pragmatic solution to CSS's inherent problems, such as global state and poor developer ergonomics. The discussion also touches on the "moving target" of modern CSS, with some arguing that foundational properties like Flexbox remain valid despite new additions like Grid, while others celebrate new features like `:has()` but note they are long overdue compared to other technologies. Ultimately, the conversation highlights a divide between those who believe developers have a responsibility to master their craft and those who argue that CSS's complexity and idiosyncrasies make it an unreasonable expectation for non-specialists.

## [GOG Patrons- Join gamers keeping classics alive](https://www.gog.com/en/patrons)
**Score:** 133 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46498775

> **Article:** GOG, a digital storefront for classic video games, has launched a "Patrons" program. This is a subscription service where users can pay a monthly fee (e.g., $5) to directly support the GOG Preservation Program. The stated goal of this program is to "save classic games from being lost to time" by securing the legal rights to them, fixing compatibility issues with modern operating systems, and rebuilding missing features to ensure they work hassle-free for modern gamers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to GOG's patron program is largely skeptical and critical, with a few points of support. The discussion centers on several key themes:

A primary concern is the financial nature of the request. Many commenters are reluctant to donate to a private, for-profit company without a guaranteed product in return. They question why they should fund GOG's acquisition of game rights only for GOG to then sell those games back to them. Suggestions were made for a more transparent model, such as specific pre-order campaigns for individual games, which would allow users to fund a particular title they want to see preserved.

The issue of intellectual property (IP) and abandonware is another major topic. Commenters express frustration that legal rights must be "secured" for games that have been commercially abandoned for years, viewing it as a failure of the IP system. There's a strong sentiment that if a company isn't selling a product, it should be considered fair game. Some users wished GOG would pledge to release preserved games into the public domain, though others noted that GOG likely only acquires limited sales licenses, not full ownership.

Transparency is a significant point of debate. Users want to know if their subscription money will be used exclusively for preservation or if it will simply become part of GOG's general revenue. While some argue this distinction is impractical in a real-world business, others feel it's a crucial promise for a program with such a specific mission.

Finally, there are discussions on the technical and practical aspects. Some argue that using emulators is a more sustainable and universal solution for preservation than patching games for each new OS version. Others defend GOG's patching as a valuable service that provides a smoother user experience. There are also complaints about GOG's perceived lack of Linux support, though other users counter that GOG games run well on Linux via Proton.
