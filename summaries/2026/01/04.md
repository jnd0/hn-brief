## [Trump says Venezuela’s Maduro captured after strikes](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/)
**Score:** 1643 | **Comments:** 3940 | **ID:** 46473348

> **Article:** This Reuters article reports on a significant military event in Venezuela. According to President Donald Trump, Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has been "captured" following a series of strikes. The article describes "loud noises" heard in the capital, Caracas, and notes that a southern area of the country is without electricity. The report frames the information as a claim made by the US President.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and critical of the reported US military action in Venezuela. Commenters express alarm and condemn the intervention, with several key themes emerging:

*   **Legality and Condemnation:** A primary focus is the illegality of the action under international law. Multiple users label the US leadership as "war criminals" who should be tried at The Hague. There is a strong sense that this is an "unprovoked" and aggressive act.

*   **Skepticism of the Narrative:** Users are highly critical of how the event is being framed. There are predictions that media headlines will be softened from "invasion" to less aggressive terms. The lack of a concerted "manufacturing consent" campaign is noted with concern, suggesting the war is being launched with little public justification.

*   **Political Cynicism:** Commenters link the event to domestic US politics. Some suggest the military action is a distraction from other controversies, such as the Epstein files. Others point out the irony of a president who ran on a "no more wars" platform now initiating a conflict.

*   **Factual Disputes:** While the main thread accepts the premise of a US strike, one commenter disputes the nature of the aircraft involved, suggesting the footage may not show Venezuelan helicopters as initially reported.

*   **International Institutions:** The role of international bodies is questioned, with users noting the irony of organizations like FIFA and the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, which had recently engaged with Venezuelan opposition figures, now being associated with the lead-up to a conflict.

## [Total monthly number of StackOverflow questions over time](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1926661#graph)
**Score:** 864 | **Comments:** 453 | **ID:** 46482345

> **Article:** The article is a data visualization from Stack Exchange Data Explorer showing the total number of monthly questions asked on Stack Overflow over time. The graph reveals a dramatic decline in question volume, dropping from a peak of over 200,000 per month in 2020 to near-zero levels by 2024.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by the interpretation of this steep decline, with two primary explanations emerging: the rise of AI and the toxicity of Stack Overflow's community culture.

Many commenters point to AI (specifically LLMs like ChatGPT) as the main driver, noting that it offers a faster, more accessible, and less judgmental alternative for solving coding problems. However, some users correctly observe that the decline began in mid-2020, well before the late-2022 ChatGPT release, suggesting the trend started earlier. This leads to a consensus that it's likely a combination of both factors: AI provided the "pull" factor, while Stack Overflow's notoriously unwelcoming and strict moderation culture created a significant "push" factor. One user humorously noted the irony of their comment potentially being closed as a "duplicate."

A secondary, more philosophical theme emerged around the future of AI training. Users questioned how future models will be trained without the precise, troubleshooting-focused data that Stack Overflow provided, suggesting that human-curated training data and documentation may become the new standard.

## [The Most Popular Blogs of Hacker News in 2025](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/)
**Score:** 499 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46478377

> **Article:** This article analyzes the most popular blog domains on Hacker News for the year 2025, based on a points-based ranking system. The top 5 blogs for 2025 are identified as Simon Willison's Blog, thenewsletter.is, jvns.ca (Julia Evans), Alexey Guzey's blog, and Fly.io's blog. The article also provides a "last 5 years" ranking, which highlights authors who were historically dominant but have since fallen in the 2025 rankings, such as Ben Thompson (Stratechery) and Julia Evans. The author notes that the data is available as a CSV file for others to analyze and provides a link to a tool for exploring the data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: the nature of community on HN, the factors influencing blog popularity, and the utility of the data itself.

A significant portion of the conversation explored the "halo effect" and community dynamics. One commenter praised the close-knit feel of the site, noting that popular bloggers are also active, thoughtful participants in discussions. However, another countered this by expressing concern that this familiarity can lead to a "groupism" where content from well-known members is upvoted defensively, even if it's mediocre, while outsiders are ignored. This was described as a tendency for HN to adopt certain authors, creating a protective instinct that can sometimes lower the quality of the front page.

The discussion also delved into the reasons behind the popularity rankings. Commenters noted that a blogger's activity level is a key factor; for example, Julia Evans's drop in the 2025 rankings was directly attributed to her publishing far fewer posts that year compared to previous years. The conversation also touched on the value of bloggers who curate content from other platforms like Twitter and TikTok, bringing interesting ideas to the open web for those who don't use those services.

Finally, several users engaged with the technical aspects of the article. The author of the analysis (simonw) demonstrated how to query the provided CSV data using a browser-based SQL tool. Other users created and shared useful resources, such as an OPML file for easy subscription to the top blogs. There were also minor, related discussions about the HN profanity filter potentially suppressing some blogs and personal comments from bloggers who had fallen in the rankings.

## [Report: Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet](https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/#google_vignette)
**Score:** 379 | **Comments:** 337 | **ID:** 46480156

> **Article:** The article reports that Microsoft has quietly removed the official method for activating Windows 11 and 10 without an internet connection. Previously, users could set up a local offline account during the initial setup, but this option is now reportedly gone, forcing users to connect to the internet and sign in with a Microsoft Account to complete the installation and activation process on consumer versions of the OS. This move is seen as another step in Microsoft's increasing push for online integration and telemetry, further limiting user choice and control over their own devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Microsoft's decision, viewing it as a hostile move against users and a significant driver for adopting alternative operating systems. A prominent theme is the acceleration of Linux adoption, with multiple users sharing personal success stories of switching family members to Linux to escape Windows' bloatware, forced updates, and invasive "dark patterns." The sentiment is that Microsoft's leadership, particularly under Satya Nadella, is misguidedly focused on pushing AI products at the expense of core software quality and user experience, with some commenters drawing parallels to the failed "Metaverse" hype.

Beyond the general outrage, the conversation offers practical workarounds for those still needing to use Windows. Suggestions include using the "massgrave.dev" script, seeking out the enterprise-focused LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) version, or simply installing Windows without activation, as the OS remains fully functional. The discussion also touches on the challenges for specific use cases, such as air-gapped environments (which may require a Key Management Server) or installing on hardware with missing drivers, though some users found simple workarounds for these issues as well. Ultimately, the consensus is that Microsoft's actions are alienating its user base and making competing platforms more attractive.

## [Explosions reported in Venezuelan capital Caracas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/explosions-reported-venezuela-caracas)
**Score:** 267 | **Comments:** 11 | **ID:** 46473623

> **Article:** A Guardian article reports on explosions heard in Caracas, Venezuela. The article provides details on the location and nature of the incident, noting that Venezuelan officials have attributed the blasts to a failed "coup" attempt by opposition forces, while residents reported hearing gunfire and explosions near a military base.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was brief and primarily focused on the appropriateness of the post rather than the event itself. The thread was quickly flagged as a duplicate of an existing story. A secondary theme was a meta-discussion about whether breaking international news belongs on Hacker News. One user questioned if the topic was off-topic, while another defended it by suggesting it could be considered an "interesting new phenomenon."

## [The suck is why we're here](https://nik.art/the-suck-is-why-were-here/)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46482877

> **Article:** The article "The suck is why we're here" argues that the difficulty and struggle inherent in creative processes like writing are not obstacles to be overcome, but are in fact the very source of their value. The author, who writes a daily blog, states his purpose is not to produce content efficiently but to "make sure I remember how to think." He posits that using AI to bypass this struggle—summarizing a book, generating an outline, or writing a post—results in a hollow product and, more importantly, robs the user of the cognitive and personal growth that comes from grappling with the work. The "suck," the author contends, is what separates true mastery and artistry from the "lowest common denominator" of easily produced slop.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's central thesis, with many commenters expressing a strong belief in the value of personal effort and the intrinsic rewards of difficult work. A recurring theme is the distinction between tools that augment thinking and those that replace it. Many users see LLMs as a dangerous shortcut that leads to "brain rot" and a loss of the feeling of genuine accomplishment, which is a key motivator for creative work. The idea of "cosplaying" one's life by offloading intellectual effort to AI was a popular and resonant concept.

However, the discussion also introduces several counterpoints and nuances. One prominent thread, sparked by the "plumber" analogy, argues that for many people, tasks like writing are chores to be minimized, not journeys of personal growth. For them, AI is a welcome tool for efficiency, just as a professional plumber is. Another pragmatic view suggests that in a world where content is a "slot machine" for career advancement, the quality and personal satisfaction of the process matter less than the outcome. There was also a philosophical debate about whether AI could ever replicate human taste or the serendipitous, human-centric details that make communication meaningful. Ultimately, the conversation affirmed the article's core message: while AI can produce technically correct text, it cannot replicate the human experience of struggle and the wisdom gained from it.

## [Late night pizzeria nearby The Pentagon has suddenly surged in traffic](https://twitter.com/PenPizzaReport/status/2007347706017251535)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46474859

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter post from an account called "PenPizzaReport," which tracks late-night pizza orders near The Pentagon. A sudden surge in pizza orders is presented as an informal indicator of unusual activity or extended working hours at the Pentagon, fueling speculation about an imminent or ongoing military operation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion immediately interprets the pizza surge as a sign of a significant military event, specifically a US operation in Venezuela. Many commenters cite a report that US forces have captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. While some express shock or question the legality and strategic value of such an action, others debate the reliability of the "pizza index" as an intelligence source, suggesting it could be easily manipulated or is simply a byproduct of journalists working late. The conversation also expands to broader geopolitical theories, including a potential "grand bargain" between the US, Russia, and China, though this is met with skepticism.

## [Swift on Android: Full Native App Development Now Possible](https://docs.swifdroid.com/app/)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 91 | **ID:** 46483023

> **Article:** The article announces the release of Swift Stream IDE v1.17.0 and the underlying open-source SwifDroid framework. This toolchain enables full native Android app development using only the Swift programming language. It allows developers to build apps without writing Java, Kotlin, or XML. The workflow involves writing code in the Swift Stream IDE, which then compiles the Swift code and generates a complete, standard Android project that can be opened in Android Studio. The framework handles the Android application lifecycle, UI components (including AndroidX and Material Design), and manages Gradle dependencies automatically.
>
> **Discussion:** The announcement sparked a multifaceted debate, primarily centered on the broader landscape of cross-platform and native mobile development.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on comparing this new tool to existing solutions. Many commenters immediately contrasted it with Flutter and React Native, questioning its purpose. The creator and other users clarified that SwifDroid's goal is fundamentally different: it is not a "write once, run anywhere" UI framework. Instead, it enables developers to build *native* Android UIs using Swift, providing full access to the platform's specific APIs and components. This positions it as an alternative for developers who want to use Swift but need to target Android, rather than a direct competitor to UI-sharing frameworks. Comparisons were also drawn to other tools like SwiftCrossUI and Skip, with the key distinction being that SwifDroid is Android-only.

The conversation also explored the broader pros and cons of using a single language for both platforms. Proponents argued that it allows teams to centralize their codebase and leverage existing Swift expertise for Android development. However, a strong counter-argument emerged from developers who have tried this approach. They suggested that while it sounds efficient, it often results in two nearly separate codebases with platform-specific workarounds, and that the benefits are outweighed by the complexity. The general sentiment was that knowing both Swift and Kotlin is not a significant burden and often leads to better, more idiomatic apps.

Finally, the discussion touched on the overall state of mobile development. Some users expressed frustration with the fragmentation of tools (React Native, Flutter, Swift on Android, etc.), while others defended their preferred frameworks, such as Flutter, highlighting its free and comprehensive nature. There was also a recurring sentiment that for complex applications, sticking to separate, truly native codebases remains the most robust approach, despite the initial appeal of cross-platform solutions.

## [China DRAM Maker CXMT Targets $4.2B IPO as It Takes on Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron](https://www.ic-pcb.com/chinas-leading-dram-maker-cxmt-targets-42-billion-ipo-as-it-takes-on-samsung-sk-hynix-and-micron.html)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46482777

> **Article:** The article reports that China's leading DRAM manufacturer, ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT), is targeting a $4.2 billion IPO. This move is positioned as a direct challenge to the dominant global players: Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. The article suggests CXMT's rapid technological progress, particularly its ability to achieve 10nm-class DRAM production, may be linked to alleged industrial espionage, citing reports of a former Samsung engineer leaking critical process data. This development occurs amidst a high-demand, high-price market for memory chips.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, touching on technology, market dynamics, and geopolitics. A central technical point of debate is the equipment CXMT uses, with one user questioning how they can compete without ASML machines, while another clarifies that DRAM manufacturing is less reliant on the latest lithography tech than other sectors. The potential for CXMT to disrupt the market is a major theme. Some users express hope that this new competition will finally lower the currently "insane" prices for consumers, while others analyze the incumbents' strategy of prioritizing profit maximization over a costly market share war, which could be challenged by a state-subsidized newcomer.

The discussion heavily features skepticism regarding CXMT's methods and motives. Multiple comments highlight the alleged theft of Samsung's trade secrets as a key accelerant for CXMT's progress, with some viewing it as a standard, if illicit, part of global business competition. There is also a cynical view that CXMT will simply join in "illegal price fixing" rather than genuinely lowering prices. Finally, the conversation broadens to a critique of the entire tech industry, with some commenters drawing parallels to historical cases like Nortel and expressing disillusionment with the perceived economic "death spiral" and waste of resources in the current AI boom.

## [Recursive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)
**Score:** 133 | **Comments:** 23 | **ID:** 46475395

> **Article:** The paper "Recursive Language Models" (RLM) proposes a new architecture where long prompts are not fed directly into the neural network. Instead, the prompt acts as an environment that the LLM can symbolically interact with. The model generates "actions" (like search queries or code execution) to retrieve and process information from the prompt context, rather than consuming the raw text in one go. This allows the model to handle contexts that exceed standard token limits by recursively exploring and summarizing the data as needed, effectively creating a "model that calls itself" to manage complexity and length.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on comparing the RLM concept to existing techniques and debating its novelty. The central point of contention was whether this is fundamentally different from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One user argued that the key distinction is that the LLM itself implements the retrieval mechanism, making it "agentic" rather than a pre-defined workflow. Others were skeptical, suggesting this is simply a rebranding of "subagents," where one LLM call delegates tasks to others to keep the main context clean. A recurring sentiment was that while the idea isn't new (citing past projects like BabyAGI), it may now be feasible due to improved model capabilities. Several users also requested more readable summaries of the paper and discussed the practical need for better context management tools in existing products like Claude Code.

## [X-Clacks-Overhead](https://hleb.dev/post/x-clacks-overhead/)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46475437

> **Article:** The article explains the "X-Clacks-Overhead" HTTP header, a tribute to the late author Terry Pratchett. It references the "Clacks" system from his *Discworld* novels—a semaphore-based telegraph network where the names of deceased operators are transmitted along with messages to keep their memory alive ("GNU Terry Pratchett"). The post details how web administrators can configure their servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to include this custom header in HTTP responses, effectively "transmitting" Pratchett's name over the web. The header serves as a digital memorial, embodying the sentiment that "a man is not dead while his name is still spoken."
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely nostalgic and appreciative of the "X-Clacks-Overhead" tradition. Users express enjoyment of "goofy" or sentimental headers that add personality to the web, with one commenter sharing a similar discovery of an "X-Employment" header on an AT&T outage page. There is a brief technical debate regarding the "X-" prefix convention; while one user cites RFC 6648 to suggest it is deprecated, others question the practical harm of the practice. The conversation also touches on the implementation details, such as using Cloudflare workers or static server configs, and clarifies that the header is a symbolic gesture rather than "cargo culting."

## [Tally – A tool to help agents classify your bank transactions](https://tallyai.money/)
**Score:** 86 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46475218

> **Article:** The article introduces "Tally," a new tool designed to help users classify and categorize their bank transactions using AI. The tool's website is minimalist, and it appears to be a personal project aimed at solving the problem of transaction categorization by leveraging a non-deterministic AI model instead of traditional rule-based systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Tally was largely critical and skeptical, with a few points of support. A dominant theme was the criticism of using a probabilistic AI model for a problem that many argue is fundamentally deterministic. Commenters suggested that simple substring matching or regex rules (as used in tools like hledger or Ledger) are more reliable, cheaper to run, and won't "hallucinate" incorrect categories, dismissing the project as "resume-driven development."

Several other key concerns were raised:
*   **Privacy and Security:** A significant number of users expressed reluctance to share sensitive banking data with an AI service, preferring solutions that use local models or avoid third-party AI providers entirely.
*   **User Experience and Integration:** The tool was criticized for not being user-friendly, as it requires users to manually handle their data import rather than offering direct bank integrations. Commenters pointed to existing services like Puzzle.io that offer more seamless, "turnkey" solutions.
*   **AI "Vibe":** The website's minimalist design was perceived as "LLM-generated," sparking a meta-discussion about the low-effort aesthetics of many new AI projects.
*   **Counterarguments:** A minority of voices defended the tool, arguing that transaction categorization is a genuinely difficult and "ill-defined" problem with many edge cases, making AI a potentially suitable approach. They also praised the project for being open-sourced.

The discussion also included a minor historical note that the name "Tally" is already used by a long-established accounting software company.

## [Pickle 1 AR Glasses (YC W25) May Be Fraudulent](https://twitter.com/thedowd/status/2007337800430198913)
**Score:** 84 | **Comments:** 27 | **ID:** 46483429

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter/X thread by user "thedowd" that accuses Pickle 1, an AR glasses startup recently accepted into Y Combinator's Winter 2025 batch, of being fraudulent. The thread analyzes the company's promotional video and claims, arguing that their promises of a sleek, powerful, and ready-to-manufacture device are technologically impossible given current hardware limitations. The accuser points to a lack of visible charging ports, unrealistic power and latency claims, and the general difficulty of miniaturizing AR technology, concluding that the company is likely selling a fantasy rather than a real product.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on whether Pickle 1 is an outright scam or an ambitious startup that may fail to deliver. The community is divided into two main camps: skeptics who find the fraud allegations plausible and defenders who believe the technical criticisms in the original article are flawed.

Several users supported the fraud theory, citing:
*   **Technical Impossibility:** A power optimization expert argued that the promised features, brightness, and battery life are not feasible with current technology, especially for a small startup without custom silicon.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Another user noted that many startups in this space simply rebrand existing hardware from Chinese OEMs and use a supplier's roadmap to create an illusion of rapid development, sometimes leading to fraud charges.
*   **Precedent:** One commenter drew a parallel to Immersed Visor, another AR device that made grand promises, faced significant delays, and has yet to ship a final product.

Conversely, a strong counter-argument emerged, led by a user with a computer vision background, who claimed the original article's technical analysis was "extremely idiotic." This defense argued that:
*   The tracking and motion shown in the video are easily achievable with the described hardware (stereoscopic cameras) using decades-old computer vision techniques, and do not require the complex SLAM systems the original article criticized.
*   The lack of visible charging ports in marketing images is irrelevant, as these are likely renders, not photos of the final product.

Other points of discussion included:
*   **Design vs. Reality:** One user conceded that Pickle's design looked far superior to Meta's but argued this was only possible because they weren't constrained by the practical realities of fitting real hardware and batteries inside.
*   **The "Glasshole" Concern:** A debate on whether cameras on glasses are a social barrier. One user suggested using ultrasound instead of cameras to avoid this, but others countered that cameras are the primary feature people want (for POV video) and that social acceptance has already shifted.
*   **A High-Stakes Bet:** The discussion highlighted a challenge from the original article's author to Pickle's CEO: a personal bet on the company's ability to deliver its product by Q2 2026, with the author offering to pay the company's pre-order revenue if they succeed, and demanding the CEO pay that amount if they fail.

## [Profiling with Ctrl-C (2024)](https://yosefk.com/blog/profiling-with-ctrl-c.html)
**Score:** 83 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46475296

> **Article:** The article "Profiling with Ctrl-C" presents a simple, low-tech method for performance profiling. The technique involves repeatedly sending the SIGINT signal (Ctrl-C) to a running process and capturing the resulting stack traces. By doing this many times, one can build a statistical profile of where the program spends most of its time. The author argues that for simple problems, where a single function is consuming the majority of CPU, this method is often sufficient and much easier to set up than using a dedicated profiler like `perf` or `gprof`. The article also provides practical advice on how to automate the process with a shell script and how to interpret the results.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, treating the Ctrl-C method as a classic "poor man's profiler." The conversation centers on the technique's utility, its limitations, and its relationship to more sophisticated tools.

Key points from the discussion include:

*   **A Valid and Simple Technique:** Many commenters confirm that this is a well-known and effective method for quickly identifying major performance bottlenecks. It's praised for its simplicity and lack of setup overhead.
*   **Limitations for Minor Offenders:** A primary point of contention is the technique's effectiveness. While universally seen as great for finding the "one big offender" (e.g., a function consuming 80% of CPU), it is acknowledged as being too crude for finding smaller issues, such as a function consuming only 5%. For these cases, a real profiler with more precise output is considered necessary.
*   **Analogy to Memory Profiling:** Several users drew a parallel between this time-sampling method and memory leak detection techniques. The analogy is to let a memory leak grow large, take a core dump (`gcore`), and then analyze a random sample of the dump to find the most common objects, which is similarly a "poor man's" approach.
*   **Existing Tools and Automation:** The discussion highlighted that this concept is not new and has been implemented in various tools. Users referenced the "poor man's profiler" script, a similar approach using `gdb` in a loop, and even a version for GUI applications that used `SIGALRM` to sample the UI event loop.
*   **Linguistic Footnote:** A significant portion of the discussion was a humorous and detailed analysis of the author's use of the word "step" in a footnote, where he described the non-continuous nature of the sampling as "stepping into it." Commenters debated the nuances of this phrasing, comparing it to the idiom "stepped in it" (meaning to make a mistake), and discussing its translation from Russian.

## [Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/2025/09/27/cardiovascular-disease-is-a-solved-problem/)
**Score:** 80 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46478398

> **Article:** The article "Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem" argues that from a purely biomedical and scientific standpoint, we have the tools to prevent and effectively cure atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The author posits that the root cause is elevated ApoB lipoproteins (like LDL and Lp(a)), which can be accurately measured. We possess highly effective interventions to lower these levels, including precision nutrition, next-generation drugs (PCSK9 inhibitors, lepodisiran), and established medications like statins. The article concludes that the persistence of heart disease as a leading cause of death is not a failure of science, but a failure of implementation, citing systemic issues like a lack of cardiologists, misaligned financial incentives that favor treatment over prevention, and the difficulty of delivering comprehensive preventive care at scale.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's bold claim, with most commenters arguing that cardiovascular disease is far from a "solved problem." The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **Clinical Reality vs. Theory:** Many users, including those with apparent medical backgrounds, push back by stating that cardiologists themselves do not consider the disease solved. They point to ongoing research, the difficulty of treating existing plaque, and the fact that the disease is not fully understood.

*   **Systemic and Practical Barriers:** A prominent counter-argument, articulated by user brandonb, agrees that the *science* is largely solved but highlights massive bottlenecks in *delivery*. These include a shortage of specialists, the immense time required for preventive care, and financial incentives that reward hospitals for treating sick patients rather than keeping healthy people well.

*   **Causation and Treatment Nuance:** Several commenters question the simple "LDL is the cause" model. User WhatsTheBigIdea argues that while statins lower LDL and reduce risk, other drugs that lower LDL do not, suggesting the causal link is more complex and statins have other beneficial mechanisms. This highlights a debate over whether high LDL is a cause or just a strong correlation.

*   **Side Effects and Lifestyle:** The discussion around statins reveals a common concern about side effects (muscle pain, digestive issues, diabetes), with some users expressing a preference to rely on diet and exercise unless medication becomes medically necessary. Others note that root lifestyle causes like obesity and poor diet remain unsolved.

*   **Oversimplification and Neglect of Other Factors:** The article is criticized for oversimplifying the issue. Users point out that it downplays genetic factors like Lp(a) (which affects a large portion of the population) and ignores other cardiac problems like valve failure or electrical issues that are not related to cholesterol.

## [Show HN: Vibe Coding a static site on a $25 Walmart Phone](https://stetsonblake.com/%2425+Walmart+Phone+for+Hackers)
**Score:** 72 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46480677

> **Project:** The project demonstrates hosting a static website on a $25 prepaid Android phone (a Motorola Moto G 2025) purchased from Walmart. The author used "vibe coding" with Claude Code to assist in setting up the environment. The technical stack involves using Andronix (a Linux environment app) to run Ubuntu, installing Nginx to serve the site, and utilizing a Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the local server to the internet securely. The author highlights the phone's built-in battery acting as a UPS and its capable hardware (8 cores, 4GB RAM) for such a task.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction focused on the technical implementation, the "vibe coding" aspect, and the project's premise. A primary technical question was why the author needed the full Andronix/Ubuntu setup rather than just using Termux or lightweight Android HTTP servers, with the author responding that Andronix provided better service management. The "vibe coding" element drew scrutiny; one user noted that the tutorial itself seemed to be AI-generated content laundered through the author, while another pointed out that the "cost" should include the price of AI tokens, not just the hardware.

Regarding the hardware, users debated whether the $25 price was misleading due to carrier subsidies, though the author argued it is a valid retail price. There was also concern about the feasibility of handling traffic without caching, but the author noted the hardware was easily handling the load. Finally, users discussed the practicality of leaving a phone plugged in permanently (risking battery swelling) and the limitations of Android hardware access for projects like webcams.

## [Xr0 verifier, guarantee the safety of C programs at compile time](https://xr0.dev)
**Score:** 72 | **Comments:** 20 | **ID:** 46479673

> **Article:** The article (and linked website) introduces Xr0, a tool that aims to verify the memory safety of C programs at compile time. It positions itself as a "static debugger" for "vanilla C," using a system of annotations to prove that code is free from memory errors without requiring a rewrite of the code in a new language. The goal is to provide Rust-like safety guarantees for existing or new C codebases by analyzing them statically.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the Xr0 project, primarily due to its lack of recent progress and its vague positioning. The conversation centers on three main themes:

First, commenters note that the project appears stalled, pointing out that there have been no code commits since March 2025 and that the project has been in an "initial signs are promising" state since 2023. This lack of activity leads to significant doubt about its viability.

Second, users question the tool's novelty and effectiveness compared to existing solutions. One user explicitly asks how Xr0 differentiates itself from established tools like Checked C or Frama C, a question that went unanswered. Others point out that C's inherent flexibility makes retrofitting static verification difficult, which is why languages like Rust restrict the language itself to make safety guarantees possible.

Finally, there is a debate on the practicality of Xr0's annotation-based approach. While the tool claims to work with "vanilla C," it does require annotations. Commenters discuss the trade-offs of such systems, with one suggesting that the correct approach for unverifiable code is to error out rather than attempt to fix it (like D's default initialization), as this makes the code's behavior clearer and safer.

## [Take One Small Step](https://thinkhuman.com/take-one-small-step/)
**Score:** 69 | **Comments:** 15 | **ID:** 46482107

> **Article:** The article "Take One Small Step" explores the psychological principle of overcoming procrastination and anxiety by breaking down daunting tasks into minuscule, manageable actions. It posits that large goals trigger the brain's amygdala, initiating a fight-or-flight stress response that leads to avoidance. By contrast, taking a "one small step"—such as "write one sentence" instead of "write a book"—is so insignificant that it bypasses this threat detection system. The article advocates for this "kaizen" (continuous improvement) approach, suggesting that momentum is built not through sheer willpower but by consistently taking tiny, non-threatening steps that accumulate into significant progress over time.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's core premise, with many commenters noting that the concept is a popularization of ideas from books like *Atomic Habits* and *The Now Habit*. A key point of resonance was the connection between task initiation, stress, and distraction, with one user highlighting the article's insight that small steps can "sneak" past the amygdala as a particularly useful takeaway.

However, the conversation also introduced practical nuances and potential pitfalls. A prominent concern was the "house full of easy first steps" failure mode, where individuals accumulate many preparatory actions (like buying running shoes) without making meaningful progress toward the actual goal. A suggested counter-strategy was to ensure the small step not only has low friction but also maximizes progress. Another user noted that while the approach is powerful, it requires significant upfront mental energy to distill a large project into the *right* next physical action, a point echoed by a reference to the Getting Things Done methodology. The discussion also branched into related topics like exposure therapy and language learning, with a user sharing a personal strategy of forcing a single-sentence daily practice to overcome the initial activation barrier.
