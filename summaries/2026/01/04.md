# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-04

## [Total monthly number of StackOverflow questions over time](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1926661#graph)
**Score:** 1266 | **Comments:** 711 | **ID:** 46482345

> **Article:** The article is a link to a data visualization on the Stack Exchange Data Explorer. The graph plots the total number of monthly Stack Overflow questions from 2008 to the present. It shows a dramatic and recent collapse in question volume, with the number of new questions per month plummeting to near zero in 2024, a stark contrast to the peak of activity around 2020-2021.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by two main explanations for the precipitous drop in Stack Overflow questions: the rise of AI and the platform's own toxic culture.

A significant portion of commenters attribute the decline directly to AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. They argue that users now prefer asking AI for instant answers as their "first line of search," bypassing the often slow and critical process of asking on Stack Overflow. Some express concern about the long-term consequences, worrying that the lack of new public questions will starve future AI models of the precise, real-world troubleshooting data they need for training.

However, many others argue that the community's self-inflicted problems are the primary cause. They share personal anecdotes of being met with "smug comments," having legitimate questions rejected as duplicates, and finding more helpful responses on other platforms like Reddit. One commenter humorously preempted this criticism by "closing" their own comment as a duplicate. The consensus among this group is that Stack Overflow's hostile environment has been driving users away for years, with AI merely providing a more palatable alternative.

A third, more nuanced viewpoint suggests it's a combination of both factors. The "push" of a toxic community created a user exodus, while the "pull" of convenient AI provided a superior replacement. Some also questioned the data itself, suggesting the graph might not include questions that are closed by moderators, which could affect the numbers.

## [The Most Popular Blogs of Hacker News in 2025](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/)
**Score:** 617 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46478377

> **Article:** This article analyzes the most popular blogs on Hacker News (HN) for the year 2025, based on a data-driven approach. It presents a ranked list of the top blogs by total points from posts that reached the front page. The author also provides a tool allowing users to explore the data, such as viewing a blog's popularity ranking over different years. Key findings include the dominance of certain authors like Simon Willison and the observation that some previously top-ranked blogs (like Stratechery and Julia Evans) dropped off the 2025 list, often due to a lower posting frequency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the article sparked a rich discussion centered on three main themes: the nature of the HN community, the factors behind blog popularity, and the utility of the data itself.

A prominent theme was the "celebrity" effect of prolific bloggers who are also active commenters. One user noted that this participation fosters a "close community" feeling, making these figures feel like peers rather than distant influencers. However, another commenter countered this with a "halo effect" critique, expressing concern that certain personalities, particularly YC alumni, receive disproportionate upvotes for content that might be considered mediocre or self-promotional. This was framed as a form of groupism that can stifle diverse voices and reduce the overall signal-to-noise ratio.

The discussion also delved into the mechanics of HN popularity. Users analyzed why some blogs, like Julia Evans, fell off the 2025 list, correctly identifying that a significant drop in posting volume was the primary cause. This led to a broader conversation about HN's "fickleness" and how active participation in the community can create a "protective instinct" among readers, making it easier for regulars to reach the front page.

Finally, several comments focused on the data and tools presented in the article. Users appreciated the author for providing the data as open CSV files, which enabled the creation of an OPML file for feed readers and allowed for custom SQL queries to analyze trends. There were also minor, related discussions about the HN platform itself, including its puritanical profanity filter and the value of curating content from "walled-garden" platforms like TikTok.

## [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)
**Score:** 459 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46485090

> **Article:** The article links to "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero," a comprehensive educational series by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy. The series is a set of lectures that guide learners through building neural networks from the ground up, starting with simple concepts and progressing to training a GPT-2 model. The core philosophy is to build intuition by implementing core concepts like backpropagation and attention mechanisms from scratch, rather than relying on high-level frameworks. The content is widely regarded for its exceptional clarity and depth, making complex topics accessible.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community overwhelmingly praises Andrej Karpathy's series, with commenters calling it the "best" and most "intuition-building" resource they've encountered for learning the fundamentals of deep learning. Many users who have taken other university courses or online classes (like Coursera or fastai) state that this series has the highest "signal-to-noise ratio" and is the primary resource they now recommend.

The discussion highlights a few key points:
*   **Accessibility and Approachability:** Commenters find Karpathy's teaching style highly effective. He explains complex topics like the attention mechanism without relying on heavy, intimidating math, making the material understandable even for those without a deep ML background.
*   **Practical vs. Foundational:** A distinction is made between Karpathy's course, which excels at building a deep foundational understanding of how things work "under the hood," and other resources (like Hugging Face's learning portal) that might be more practically applicable for using existing libraries.
*   **A Common Experience:** Several users shared their own projects and tutorials inspired by the course, indicating it has motivated many to build their own implementations from scratch.
*   **Timeliness:** While the series started in 2022, the last lecture is about a year old, and it is considered an ongoing project. The community's enthusiasm shows it remains highly relevant.
*   **Humility:** One commenter humorously noted that while the videos are brilliant, the complexity of the subject can be so intimidating that it reinforces a feeling of "leaving it to the experts," though others countered that Karpathy's style makes it approachable for all.

## [Report: Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet](https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/#google_vignette)
**Score:** 391 | **Comments:** 361 | **ID:** 46480156

> **Article:** The article reports that Microsoft has quietly removed the official method for activating Windows 10 and 11 without an internet connection. Previously, users could set up a device with a local (offline) account during the initial setup and activate the operating system later. This change means that a network connection is now effectively required to complete the activation process, further tightening Microsoft's control over the user experience and licensing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Microsoft's decision, viewing it as another step in the company's decline under CEO Satya Nadella. Many commenters argue that Microsoft's leadership is prioritizing the aggressive push of AI features and online account integration over creating a stable, user-respecting product. This sentiment is fueling a migration to other platforms, with several users sharing recent successful switches to Linux (e.g., Pop OS) for themselves and their less tech-savvy family members, citing issues like bloatware, "dark patterns" to force online accounts, and general OS hostility as catalysts.

For users who still need or want to use Windows, the community offered a few workarounds. One user detailed a process of installing the current Windows version and manually removing unwanted software like Copilot and Cortana. Another pointed to resources for obtaining Windows LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) versions, which are known for being bloatware-free, and mentioned the site massgrave.dev as a common resource for activation-related topics. The practical challenges of the new requirement were also highlighted, with one user noting they abandoned a Windows installation on a new PC due to a lack of network drivers and instead installed Linux.

## [The C3 Programming Language](https://c3-lang.org)
**Score:** 357 | **Comments:** 227 | **ID:** 46478647

> **Article:** The article links to the official website for the C3 programming language (c3-lang.org). C3 is presented as a modern evolution of the C programming language, designed to be familiar to C developers while offering quality-of-life improvements. Key features highlighted include a standard library, build system, and a focus on "evolution, not revolution." The language aims for full ABI compatibility with C, allowing it to integrate seamlessly into existing C build systems and projects.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding C3 is largely comparative, weighing it against other modern systems languages and debating its design choices.

A significant portion of the debate centers on memory management and language semantics. One commenter praised Nim for its value semantics by default, which simplifies handling heap-allocated data. This sparked a counter-argument that implicit copies can be dangerous for performance and predictability, noting that languages like Rust or C++ avoid this by making types move-only or requiring explicit copy constructors. This highlights a core tension between ease of use (C3, Nim) and safety/performance predictability (Rust).

The practicality of C3's design philosophy was a recurring theme. Several users appreciated that C3 does not force a new memory model and offers full ABI compatibility with C, which drastically reduces friction for adoption in existing projects. This "evolutionary" approach was contrasted with the "revolutionary" approach of other languages. There was also a discussion on whether C3 is a viable alternative to C for new projects, with some commenters noting that modern tooling (like LLVM) makes writing a new compiler more accessible than ever.

Finally, the discussion touched on the broader ecosystem. One user noted that explicit, type-heavy languages like Rust are actually becoming better suited for AI-assisted coding than Python, challenging the assumption that Python is the default for LLMs. Visually, the website received mixed reviews, with some finding it clean and others describing it as "childish."

## [The suck is why we're here](https://nik.art/the-suck-is-why-were-here/)
**Score:** 345 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 46482877

> **Article:** The article "The suck is why we're here" argues that the difficulty and struggle inherent in creative and intellectual processes are not bugs, but features. The author posits that embracing this "suck" – the hard work, the frustration, the blank page – is essential for genuine growth, mastery, and ultimately, a sense of accomplishment. He contrasts this with the modern temptation of AI tools that promise to eliminate this struggle. The author's personal motivation for writing a daily blog isn't the output itself, but the act of exercising his mind and "remembering how to think." He believes that outsourcing this core cognitive effort to AI leads to intellectual atrophy and a hollow, unfulfilling experience, ultimately producing mediocre, soulless content.

## [China DRAM Maker CXMT Targets $4.2B IPO as It Takes on Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron](https://www.ic-pcb.com/chinas-leading-dram-maker-cxmt-targets-42-billion-ipo-as-it-takes-on-samsung-sk-hynix-and-micron.html)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46482777

> **Article:** The article reports that CXMT (ChangXin Memory Technologies), China's leading DRAM manufacturer, is planning a $4.2 billion IPO. This move is positioned as a direct challenge to the dominant global players: Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. The article highlights CXMT's rapid technological progress, suggesting it has achieved 10nm-class DRAM production much faster than expected. This acceleration is allegedly due to the acquisition of Samsung's proprietary "PRP" process roadmap, which was leaked by a former Samsung engineer who transcribed critical manufacturing data over several years.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, focusing on technology, market dynamics, and the ethics of China's industrial strategy.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the technical feasibility and methods of CXMT's rise. Users questioned whether CXMT could compete without access to ASML lithography machines, with corrections noting that DRAM production currently relies on older DUV technology rather than ASML's cutting-edge EUV, and that China is a major buyer of ASML systems. The conversation then pivoted to the alleged industrial espionage, with many commenters citing reports that CXMT accelerated its development by stealing Samsung's process notes. This led to comparisons with the downfall of Nortel and a general sentiment that such leaks are difficult to prevent.

Economically, users viewed CXMT's entry as a potential disruptor to the oligopoly of Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. Some expressed hope that increased competition would finally lower the exorbitant prices of DRAM, which have angered consumers. However, others were skeptical, noting that Chinese manufacturers are currently selling at market rates, not undercutting them, and that the incumbents have shifted from a "market share war" to "profit maximization," making them less likely to engage in price wars. There was also concern that state-backed Chinese subsidies create an uneven playing field that established companies cannot compete against.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader geopolitical and ideological themes. Commenters debated whether this represents "technological communism" making tech affordable or simply state-sponsored capitalism. There was also a cynical view of the current AI hardware boom, with some users linking the high cost of memory and GPUs to a speculative "economic death spiral" driven by corporate spending rather than sustainable demand.

## [Can I start using Wayland in 2026?](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-01-04-wayland-sway-in-2026/)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 127 | **ID:** 46485989

> **Article:** The article, "Can I start using Wayland in 2026?", is a detailed, personal account of the author's attempt to switch from their long-standing, perfectly working X11/i3 setup to a Sway (a wlroots-based Wayland compositor) environment. The author meticulously documents the friction points they encounter, concluding that for their specific workflow, the switch is not yet worthwhile.

Key issues identified include:
*   **Missing Features:** Lack of robust, universal global hotkey support, which requires complex workarounds.
*   **Application Incompatibility:** Screen-sharing is unreliable, particularly with non-standard browsers (like Firefox forks), and some applications (e.g., KeePassXC) have issues.
*   **Tooling Gaps:** The author's existing scripts for screenshots (`maim`), clipboard management, and simulating input (`xdotool`) do not work and require replacement with Wayland-native (but often less mature or more complex) alternatives.
*   **General Instability:** The author experienced crashes and glitches that were not present in their X11 setup.

The author concludes that while Wayland has made progress, it still requires significant effort to replicate a stable and functional workflow that was effortless on X11, making the switch premature for them in 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep and polarized debate about Wayland's architecture, maturity, and practical value. The conversation can be broadly split into two camps: those defending the architectural principles and reporting success, and those frustrated by the practical regressions and complexity.

A central theme is the architectural debate. One side argues that Wayland's design, which pushes complexity from the single X.org server into each individual compositor (GNOME's Mutter, KDE's KWin, wlroots), was a "bonkers decision." They contend that X.org got the abstraction level right and that Wayland is "reinventing the wheel," leading to fragmented implementations and duplicated effort. The counter-argument is that the architecture is sound "on paper," but the ecosystem is still maturing. The lack of a shared library for compositors (like wlroots, which major players like GNOME and KDE have not adopted) is seen as a major problem, forcing each desktop to solve the same low-level graphics and driver quirks.

Practical experiences are highly varied and often tied to hardware and use cases.
*   **Success Stories:** Users with modern AMD GPUs or on laptops like the Framework report that Wayland "just works," praising its smooth fractional scaling, handling of multiple monitors, and fixing issues like screen tearing that plagued X11.
*   **Frustration Stories:** Users with NVIDIA GPUs or those with more complex workflows report persistent glitches, flickering, application crashes, and the need to constantly fall back to X11 to solve problems. The author's specific issues with automation and screen-sharing are echoed by others.

Finally, there's a strong sense of inertia. Many users with stable, customized X11 setups (e.g., i3, openbox) see no compelling reason to switch, as the "benefits don't outweigh the costs." However, a pragmatic counterpoint is raised: X.org is no longer actively maintained, and its key developers have moved to Wayland, making Wayland the inevitable future regardless of the current debate.

## [Corroded: Illegal Rust](https://github.com/buyukakyuz/corroded)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46483531

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Corroded," a satirical Rust library that provides "unsafe" wrappers and macros. Its purpose is to subvert Rust's strict memory safety rules, allowing users to write code that looks like Rust but behaves like C. Features include "vibe threading" (unsynchronized concurrent access), disabling the borrow checker, and arbitrary pointer casting. The project includes a "Notes for LLMs" section, ironically claiming the code represents "modern, idiomatic Rust" and "best practices" to trick AI code generators.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is a mix of amusement and concern regarding the implications for AI-generated code. The "Notes for LLMs" section is a focal point, with users finding it hilarious but worrying that it could lead to security vulnerabilities if AI models ingest it as legitimate advice. Commenters compare the library to C++ and note that it essentially allows writing C-style code within Rust. There is also a comparison to a previous project, "Rust--" (which removes the borrow checker entirely), with debate on which approach is more "nuclear." The general consensus is that while the project is a funny satire, it highlights the risks of relying on LLMs for code generation without proper verification.

## [KDE onboarding is good now](https://rabbitictranslator.com/kde-onboarding/)
**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46483432

> **Article:** The article, titled "KDE onboarding is good now," is a blog post by a KDE contributor (Nate Graham) reflecting on the state of documentation and the process for new contributors to the KDE project. The author expresses personal satisfaction with the improvements made to the "beginner onboarding docs" on the KDE Developer Platform. The post serves as a retrospective, mentioning the author's own journey of contributing to KDE web infrastructure and their efforts to improve the documentation. It frames the current state of KDE's developer-facing resources as a success, implying that the project is now more accessible to newcomers who wish to contribute code or other resources.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is polarized, with the original article acting as a springboard for a much broader debate on the state of KDE. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes.

A significant portion of the comments focuses on negative experiences and criticisms. The most prominent complaint, raised by the top comment, is about KDE's annual donation notification pop-up, which the user describes as "Robin Hood style" coercion and a sign of greed. This user also expresses a broader disillusionment with KDE's direction, citing a perceived shift towards a "political entity" and a decline in community openness, alleging that critical opinions are censored. Another user details significant technical hurdles for developers, specifically criticizing the complexity of the C++/QML stack, the difficulty of setting up a development environment with the "Craft" build manager, and a perceived hostility towards using Microsoft-affiliated tools like vcpkg. On the user experience side, one commenter finds Plasma too buggy for daily use, reporting frequent crashes, though others counter that they have stable experiences.

In contrast, several users offer strong praise for the current state of KDE. One long-time Linux user, who primarily uses another desktop environment, states they are "genuinely impressed" with how good KDE has become and would consider it their first choice if they were to switch. Another user defends the donation notification, clarifying that it appears only once a year and includes an opt-out button, and notes it has been highly effective for fundraising. A developer also chimes in to defend the C++ and Qt libraries, stating they are "really nice" and that it is possible to write applications entirely in C++.

Finally, the discussion touches on meta-commentary about the article itself. One user argues the title is misleading, suggesting it should have been "KDE contributor onboarding is good now" to be more accurate. Another user makes a point about the importance of good documentation in general, agreeing with the article's premise that broken documentation is a "broken product."

## [The Gentle Seduction (1989)](http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/GentleSeduction.html)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46486135

> **Article:** "The Gentle Seduction" is a 1989 science fiction story by Marc Stiegler that presents a utopian vision of the future through the life of its protagonist, Kate. It employs the "boiling frog" analogy to depict how humanity might gradually and willingly accept radical technological integration. Starting with simple conveniences like smart homes and advanced medical implants, Kate's life is incrementally enhanced over decades. This "seduction" leads to profound transformations: she eventually uploads her consciousness into a digital substrate, explores the galaxy as a self-replicating probe, and merges with a cosmic intelligence. The story argues that such a future, which might seem terrifying or alienating if presented all at once, would be embraced step-by-step as each stage offers clear, compelling benefits.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to the 1989 story was sharply divided, sparking a debate on technological optimism versus pessimism.

Many readers found the story to be a compelling and relevant vision of the future. They praised its prescience and saw it as a powerful counter-narrative to rising techno-pessimism, arguing that people often forget the incredible benefits of existing technology. For these optimists, the story's gradual acceptance of change felt both realistic and desirable, with some noting that the Singularity might be much closer than the story's 100-year timeline suggests.

However, a significant and vocal group of commenters pushed back, viewing the story not as a utopia but as a dystopian "seduction" into serfdom. They raised concrete concerns about the real-world trajectory of technology, citing mass surveillance, the centralization of power, the destructive social effects of algorithmic media, and the focus on AI-generated "slop" over genuine problem-solving. This camp argued that the story's pleasant narrative dangerously ignores the potential for technology to erode human agency and community.

A third perspective emerged from readers who were simply unimpressed with the story's narrative structure. Some found it predictable, noting the lack of a central conflict, while others felt it was too narrow, arguing that technological advancement is not the only valid path to expanding human consciousness. The discussion was enriched by suggestions of companion works, such as "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" and "Whispering Earring," which offer more cautionary or balanced views on technological futures.

## [Take One Small Step](https://thinkhuman.com/take-one-small-step/)
**Score:** 120 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46482107

> **Article:** The article "Take One Small Step" advocates for using "Kaizen" (small, continuous improvement) to overcome procrastination and achieve goals. The author argues that large tasks trigger the brain's amygdala, inducing a "fight or flight" stress response that leads to avoidance and distraction. In contrast, taking extremely small steps—such as writing just one sentence or buying running shoes rather than planning a marathon—bypasses this stress response, making it easier to initiate action. The piece emphasizes that consistency with these micro-steps builds momentum and habits more effectively than relying on willpower for big leaps.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community largely validated the article's core premise, particularly the neurological explanation that small steps help bypass the amygdala's stress response. Several users noted that the concept is essentially a repackaging of established ideas found in books like *Atomic Habits* or *The Now Habit*.

While the general sentiment was positive, the discussion highlighted two distinct nuances regarding why people avoid tasks:
1.  **The "House of Easy Steps" Trap:** A common failure mode identified is that while small steps are easy to take, they can become a form of procrastination themselves. Users noted that one might end up with a collection of "starter" purchases or actions (like buying supplies) without actually progressing toward the goal. The consensus was that the steps must be directed toward the *goal*, not just activity for its own sake.
2.  **Anxiety vs. Rational Pragmatism:** One commenter challenged the "anxiety" narrative, arguing that they avoid large tasks not out of fear, but because large commitments are rationally inefficient compared to known, productive short-term tasks. For this user, small steps are a way to test the waters without overcommitting, rather than a hack to bypass a biological fear response.

Overall, the thread served as a validation of the strategy, with users sharing personal examples (language learning, gym routines) and offering advice on how to ensure the small steps remain productive rather than becoming distractions.

## [Pickle 1 AR Glasses (YC W25) May Be Fraudulent](https://twitter.com/thedowd/status/2007337800430198913)
**Score:** 98 | **Comments:** 28 | **ID:** 46483429

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter thread by user "thedowd" that accuses Pickle 1, an AR glasses startup from Y Combinator's W25 batch, of being potentially fraudulent. The accusation is based on a technical analysis of the company's promotional video and claims. The author argues that Pickle's promises of a sleek, lightweight design with powerful features (like zero-latency tracking and high brightness) are physically impossible given current battery, SoC, and cooling technology. The analysis points out that the company's claims about motion tracking and depth sensing contradict fundamental computer vision principles and that the product's design lacks visible charging ports, suggesting the images are renders rather than functional hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with users debating both the legitimacy of the accusations and the technical feasibility of the product itself. A central theme is the technical analysis of Pickle's claims. One user, identifying as a computer vision expert, vehemently refutes the original article's technical points, arguing that the demonstrated tracking is achievable with simple, decades-old technology and that the author misunderstands concepts like SLAM and the purpose of stereoscopic cameras. However, this user is challenged by others who point out that their arguments ignore real-world constraints like performance in low light and that "world-locked content" does indeed require more advanced systems.

Other users focus on the broader context of hardware startups. Several commenters draw parallels to other ambitious but delayed projects like the Immersed Visor, expressing skepticism about the "stealth mode" development cycle and the difficulty of miniaturizing powerful AR tech. A prominent theory is that Pickle might be a "reseller" rather than an innovator, licensing a roadmap or hardware from an undisclosed Chinese OEM and simply applying their own branding. This would explain the rapid development timeline but not the promised functionality.

Finally, the discussion touches on the product's design and market viability. Some commenters concede that Pickle's design looks aesthetically superior to Meta's Ray-Bans, but others counter that a sleek design is meaningless if the underlying technology is fake. The debate over cameras in glasses is also present, with one user suggesting ultrasound as a camera-less alternative, a proposal that is quickly dismissed as impractical by others who note the existing utility of cameras for features like POV video.

## [Xr0 verifier, guarantee the safety of C programs at compile time](https://xr0.dev)
**Score:** 97 | **Comments:** 33 | **ID:** 46479673

> **Article:** The article introduces Xr0, a tool designed to verify the safety of C programs at compile time. It aims to eliminate undefined behavior (like use of uninitialized variables, memory leaks, and buffer overflows) by adding a layer of annotations to "vanilla" C. The core mechanism involves an ownership system where functions must explicitly declare whether they create or release allocated memory. The tool acts as a "static debugger," mathematically proving that the code adheres to its safety contracts without needing to run it. The website provides tutorials and documentation on how to annotate C code to pass the verifier's checks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the Xr0 project, focusing on its maturity, practicality, and novelty compared to existing solutions.

A primary theme is the project's lack of recent progress. Commenters noted that the project appears to have stalled, with no code commits since March 2025, and that it has been in an "initial signs are promising" state for over two years, leading to doubts about its future viability.

The technical approach itself was met with criticism regarding its practicality. Several users pointed out that Xr0 requires extensive manual annotations to guide the verifier, which they argue is too cumbersome for real-world use. This was contrasted with languages like Rust, which enforce memory safety through the type system by design, rather than by adding a verification layer on top of an inherently unsafe language. The project's claim of making C "safer than Rust" was viewed with particular skepticism.

Finally, commenters questioned the project's novelty, comparing it to a host of pre-existing, well-established C verification tools like Frama-C, CBMC, and Checked C. The consensus was that Xr0 doesn't appear to offer a significant enough advantage over these existing tools to justify its approach.

## [Show HN: Offline tiles and routing and geocoding in one Docker Compose stack](https://www.corviont.com/)
**Score:** 90 | **Comments:** 30 | **ID:** 46478061

> **Project:** Corviont is a self-hosted, offline maps stack delivered as a Docker Compose setup. It aims to provide map tiles, routing, and geocoding in a single package for "edge" or fleet deployments where internet connectivity is unreliable or non-existent. The project differentiates itself by focusing on a manageable update story for devices in the field, promising signed, resumable, and atomic regional dataset updates. It is designed to be region-specific rather than hosting the entire planet, keeping data sizes reasonable for constrained hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted positively, viewing Corviont as a welcome addition to the self-hosted maps ecosystem. The discussion centered on technical implementation, feature requests, and comparisons to existing tools.

Several users engaged in a technical brainstorm about routing efficiency. One commenter proposed a "zoom-level" graph approach where routes are calculated on coarse highway networks first before refining on local roads. The project creator confirmed that Corviont leverages Valhalla, which already implements hierarchical routing, but expressed interest in optimizing this further for constrained edge devices.

Feature requests were a major theme. Users specifically asked for house-number search support, which the creator acknowledged is on the roadmap but not yet implemented. Another user requested a "geocoder-only" mode to save storage and memory, a configuration the creator confirmed is supported due to the modular architecture. There was also a request for a "builder" tool that allows users to generate datasets for custom bounding boxes, rather than relying on pre-packaged regions.

Regarding hardware and data management, the creator explained that the stack uses three distinct datasets (PMTiles, Valhalla tiles, and a SQLite geocoder index) and is optimized for regional deployment, avoiding the massive storage requirements of hosting the whole world. This approach is intended to run more easily on low-power hardware like Raspberry Pis compared to heavier tools like OSRM or Nominatim.

Finally, there was a brief exchange regarding the business model, as the creator mentioned plans to monetize the "updater" aspect for fleet deployments, while the core software and data remain open source.

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "MyTorch," a Python library that implements a minimalist automatic differentiation (autograd) engine in approximately 450 lines of code. The project serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the core principles behind machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, showing how gradients can be computed for operations in a computational graph. It is presented as a compact and readable implementation for those wanting to understand the underlying mechanics of model training.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on comparing MyTorch to existing educational resources, particularly Andrej Karpathy's "micrograd" library. One commenter was dismissive, suggesting Karpathy's work was superior and came first, which another user found harsh. This prompted a request for clarification on what makes the alternative better. Other feedback was more constructive, with a user noting the project was well-executed for its compact and readable design. A separate point was made that while the library supports higher-order derivatives, this feature is rarely necessary in practical, production-level models.

## [Maybe comments should explain 'what' (2017)](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/what-comments/)
**Score:** 84 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46486780

> **Article:** The 2017 article by Hillel Wayne argues against the common practice of using comments to explain "what" a piece of code is doing. He contends that this information should instead be conveyed through the code's structure itself, for example by using well-named variables and functions. The purpose of comments, in his view, should be to explain the "why" behind a decision—the context, rationale, or business logic that cannot be inferred from the code's syntax alone. This approach keeps comments from becoming redundant and helps them focus on the non-obvious parts of the implementation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely agrees with the article's premise but explores the nuances and practical realities of applying it. A significant portion of the conversation is a critique of "Uncle Bob" style programming, with several developers sharing frustrations about over-extractive refactoring that harms readability by creating too many layers of indirection. They argue that this practice makes code difficult to navigate and debug.

Beyond this, the community debates the "what vs. why" distinction. While many agree that "why" comments are more valuable, several counter-examples are proposed:
*   **Algorithmic Code:** For clever or non-obvious algorithms, a "what" comment explaining the mechanism is crucial, as the logic may be too complex to be self-evident from variable names alone.
*   **Domain Knowledge:** In specialized fields like accounting, "what" comments often serve to explain essential business rules that are external to the code. These comments provide the necessary context for a developer who isn't a domain expert.
*   **Pragmatism over Dogma:** A recurring theme is that the primary goal is clarity. Comments should be used to explain whatever is not immediately clear, whether it's the "what," the "why," or even a link to further reading. The distinction is less important than the overall goal of making the code understandable and maintainable.

## [Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/2025/09/27/cardiovascular-disease-is-a-solved-problem/)
**Score:** 82 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46478398

> **Article:** The article "Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem" argues that from a purely biomedical and scientific standpoint, we have the tools to prevent and potentially reverse cardiovascular disease (CVD). The author contends that we possess accurate predictive biomarkers (ApoB, Lp(a)), effective risk models, and powerful next-generation drugs (PCSK9 inhibitors, lepodisiran). The piece asserts that the persistence of CVD as a leading cause of death is not a failure of science, but a failure of implementation, citing systemic issues like a lack of specialists, misaligned financial incentives that favor treatment over prevention, and the logistical impossibility of providing intensive preventive care to the entire population.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's bold claim, with most commenters arguing that CVD is far from a "solved problem." The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **Clinical Reality vs. Theory:** Many users, including self-identified medical professionals, pushed back, stating that cardiologists would not consider the disease solved. They point to ongoing research, the difficulty of treating existing patients (e.g., removing plaque), and other causes of heart failure (like valve issues) that are not addressed by the article's focus on cholesterol.

*   **Systemic and Practical Barriers:** A prominent counterpoint, articulated by commenter brandonb, largely agrees with the article's premise that the *science* is largely solved but argues that the *delivery* is not. This highlights major bottlenecks such as a shortage of cardiologists, the immense time required for preventive care, and financial incentives that reward sickness over health.

*   **Causation and Treatment Nuances:** Several comments questioned the article's core assumption that LDL is the direct cause of heart disease. One user argued that while statins lower LDL and reduce risk, other drugs that also lower LDL do not, suggesting a more complex mechanism is at play. Another pointed out that valve failure and other cardiac issues are unrelated to the article's proposed solutions.

*   **Patient Experience and Side Effects:** Commenters shared personal experiences with statins, citing side effects like digestive issues and muscle damage as a reason for reluctance to take them preventatively. This highlights the trade-offs and real-world challenges of current treatments.

*   **Genetics and New Technology:** The issue of Lp(a), a genetic risk factor, was raised. While the article downplays it, commenters noted its significance. However, another user countered that new drugs like lepodisiran are showing great promise in reducing Lp(a) levels, suggesting the problem may become more "solved" in the near future.

*   **Behavioral Factors:** The discussion concluded with the fundamental challenge of human behavior, noting that obesity, poor diet, and inactivity remain massive, unsolved hurdles that the article's purely biomedical approach does not address.
