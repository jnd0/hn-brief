## [Total monthly number of StackOverflow questions over time](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1926661#graph)
**Score:** 1099 | **Comments:** 600 | **ID:** 46482345

> **Article:** The article is a data visualization from Stack Exchange Data Explorer showing the total number of monthly questions asked on Stack Overflow over time. The graph reveals a dramatic decline in question volume, dropping to near-zero levels in recent data, which sparked the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on two primary explanations for the precipitous drop in Stack Overflow questions: the rise of AI and the platform's own toxic culture.

Many commenters attribute the decline to AI, specifically LLMs like ChatGPT, which have become the preferred tool for developers seeking solutions. This is viewed as a "pull" factor, where users find AI more accessible and less hostile than SO. However, some note that the decline began before the late 2022 AI boom, suggesting the trend is more complex.

The second major theme is the long-standing criticism of Stack Overflow's community culture. Users shared personal anecdotes of being met with "smug comments," having legitimate questions rejected as duplicates, and generally finding the site to be an "uninviting club." This toxicity is seen as a "push" factor that drove users away long before AI offered a viable alternative. The consensus in the thread is that it's likely a combination of both factors—a toxic community pushed users out, and a helpful AI pulled them away—that led to the collapse in question volume.

A secondary concern raised is the future of AI training data, with users debating whether the loss of Stack Overflow's "precise troubleshooting data" will hinder the development of future models.

## [The Most Popular Blogs of Hacker News in 2025](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/)
**Score:** 575 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 46478377

> **Article:** The article "The Most Popular Blogs of Hacker News in 2025" analyzes blog popularity on HN for the year 2025. It identifies the top blogs based on metrics like total score and number of front-page posts. The analysis reveals that long-time HN favorites like Simon Willison and Jeff Atwood remain at the top, while other prominent bloggers like Ben Thompson (Stratechery) and Julia Evans have fallen off the 2025 list. The author also provides a tool for exploring the data and an OPML file of the top blogs' RSS feeds for easy subscription.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the nature of community, content quality, and data analysis. A primary theme was the "halo effect" surrounding long-time, prolific members. One commenter praised these figures for being active participants, which fosters a close-knit community feel. However, another countered that this can create a protective bias, allowing "mediocre, lazy content" from regulars to reach the front page, while new voices are overlooked. This was described as a "groupism" that can reduce the quality of the front page.

Several commenters used the data to explain the changing rankings. One user provided a detailed analysis showing that Julia Evans's drop in popularity was directly correlated with a significant decrease in her blogging output for the year. Others noted that bloggers who stop publishing or shift focus naturally fall off the list.

The discussion also included practical engagement with the article's data. A key comment from Simon Willison demonstrated how to use the provided CSV files with Datasette Lite to run custom SQL queries, showcasing a powerful way to interact with the data. Another user created and shared an OPML file of the top blogs' RSS feeds, which was highly appreciated by others. Finally, minor themes included the impact of HN's profanity filter on blog visibility and a request for data cleaning contributions.

## [The C3 Programming Language](https://c3-lang.org)
**Score:** 337 | **Comments:** 206 | **ID:** 46478647

> **Article:** The article links to the official website for the C3 programming language (c3-lang.org). C3 is presented as a modern evolution of C, aiming to provide a more ergonomic development experience while maintaining C's core principles. It is designed for high-performance systems programming and emphasizes "evolution, not revolution." Key features highlighted include full ABI compatibility with C, allowing seamless integration with existing C codebases, and a standard library that is optional and can be replaced. The language is positioned as a practical choice for developers who want modern features without the steep learning curve or paradigm shifts of languages like Rust.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion around C3 is multifaceted, touching on its design philosophy, the broader landscape of "C successor" languages, and the nature of systems programming itself.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on C3's design goals and its place in the ecosystem. Multiple users praise the language for its discipline and pragmatism, particularly its commitment to ABI compatibility with C, which drastically lowers the barrier to adoption in existing projects. This is seen as a "killer feature" that reduces friction. The language's website design also received positive remarks from some, who felt it was a good example of modern language presentation.

However, the discussion quickly broadens to a recurring theme in the programming community: the proliferation of "C successor" languages. One commenter humorously notes the sheer number of such projects, while another details their own experience implementing features like generics directly in C, questioning the threshold at which creating a new language becomes worthwhile. The feasibility of building a new compiler is addressed by pointing to the power of modern toolchains like LLVM, which make such projects more accessible than in the past.

The conversation also delves into deeper technical debates about language design, particularly around memory management and value semantics. A compelling argument is made for Nim's approach, where heap-allocated data has value semantics by default, creating a "breeze" for developers. This is immediately countered by a nuanced defense of the Rust/Swift model, which uses explicit ownership and move semantics to prevent costly, implicit copies of large data structures—a trade-off between convenience and predictable performance.

Finally, there is a forward-looking discussion about how LLMs might influence the popularity of lower-level languages. One user posits that AI could make languages like C3 or Rust more viable, as they can generate boilerplate while the compiler ensures memory safety. This is met with mixed opinions; one user argues that LLMs are currently better with Python due to its vast training data, while another strongly refutes this, claiming that Rust's explicitness and strong type information actually make it a superior fit for AI-assisted coding.

## [The suck is why we're here](https://nik.art/the-suck-is-why-were-here/)
**Score:** 289 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46482877

> **Article:** The article "The suck is why we're here" argues that the difficulty and struggle inherent in creative and intellectual work are not bugs, but features. The author posits that the "easy way" offered by AI tools leads to mediocrity and a "lowest common denominator." True mastery, personal growth, and the feeling of accomplishment come from overcoming the "suck"—the hard work of thinking, wrestling with ideas, and practicing a craft. The author uses his own daily blogging habit as an example, stating its purpose isn't to produce content, but to "make sure I remember how to think." He rejects using AI for writing because the process itself is the point, and warns that offloading thinking to machines will lead to a world of "slop."

## [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 17 | **ID:** 46485090

> **Article:** The article links to Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" educational series. This is a popular and comprehensive set of lectures and tutorials (originally a course) that teaches the fundamentals of neural networks from the ground up. The series starts with the absolute basics of building a neural network in Python and progressively builds up to implementing and training large-scale models like a character-level GPT (nanogpt). The core value is its "from scratch" philosophy, which aims to give a deep, intuitive understanding of the underlying mechanics of deep learning, rather than just using high-level libraries.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News is overwhelmingly positive, with users celebrating the resource and sharing their own related experiences. The post itself quickly garnered a large number of upvotes, which one commenter noted is typical for posts about high-level, genius-level content that many users respect even if they don't fully grasp it.

The key themes of the conversation are:
*   **Endorsement and Appreciation:** The primary sentiment is that Karpathy's course is a top-tier educational resource for understanding neural networks deeply.
*   **Community Contributions:** Several users shared their own projects and tutorials that align with the course's philosophy of building things from scratch, such as a guide to creating a neural network in NumPy and blog posts about running the course's nanoGPT project.
*   **Context and Timeliness:** Some discussion centered on the fact that the course is not brand new (it was released in 2022), but others pointed out that for many, it's a new discovery (referencing the xkcd comic about learning something for the first time).
*   **Alternative Resources:** A user mentioned the Hugging Face learning portal as another high-quality option for learning about deep learning and AI.
*   **The Intimidation Factor:** A notable comment captured the feeling of many: while the content is brilliant, its depth can be intimidating, leading some to appreciate the genius from afar and leave the deep implementation work to specialists.
*   **Next Steps:** A user finishing the course asked for recommendations on what to learn next, indicating the course's effectiveness in creating a clear learning path.

## [Swift on Android: Full Native App Development Now Possible](https://docs.swifdroid.com/app/)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46483023

> **Article:** The article announces the public release of Swift Stream IDE v1.17.0 and the underlying open-source SwifDroid framework. This toolchain enables full native Android app development using only the Swift programming language. It abstracts away Java, Kotlin, XML, and Gradle by providing a Swift-based interface to the Android application lifecycle, UI widgets (including AndroidX and Material Design), and dependency management. The workflow involves writing code in the Swift Stream IDE, which then compiles the Swift and generates a complete, standard Android project that can be opened and built in Android Studio.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a community grappling with the fragmentation of cross-platform mobile development tools. The reception to SwifDroid is mixed, with opinions falling into several camps.

A primary point of debate is the tool's purpose versus that of frameworks like Flutter or React Native. Many commenters note that SwifDroid is not a "write once, run anywhere" solution; it enables writing native Android UI in Swift, but does not share that UI with iOS. This contrasts with frameworks that promise a single UI codebase, though some argue that SwifDroid's native-first approach may yield a better user experience by avoiding the compromises inherent in cross-platform UI toolkits.

There is significant discussion around the broader "cross-platform vs. native" question. A recurring sentiment is skepticism about the long-term efficiency of these frameworks. Some experienced developers argue that while they speed up initial development, they often become a hindrance when implementing platform-specific features, ultimately leading to two distinct codebases anyway. The value of learning multiple native languages (Swift and Kotlin) is presented as a more robust and liberating approach.

The conversation frequently circles back to a comparison between Flutter and React Native, with developers passionately defending their preferred tool. Flutter is praised for its comprehensive, free, and self-contained ecosystem that targets all major platforms, while React Native is sometimes criticized for its reliance on third-party services like Expo. However, the limitations of both are acknowledged, such as the lack of a 3D game engine in Flutter.

Finally, some commenters see a clear use case for SwifDroid: for developers or teams with a strong existing investment in Swift who need to add or maintain an Android presence, it allows them to leverage their existing skills and potentially unify their business logic development.

## [China DRAM Maker CXMT Targets $4.2B IPO as It Takes on Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron](https://www.ic-pcb.com/chinas-leading-dram-maker-cxmt-targets-42-billion-ipo-as-it-takes-on-samsung-sk-hynix-and-micron.html)
**Score:** 182 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46482777

> **Article:** The article reports that CXMT (ChangXin Memory Technologies), China's leading DRAM manufacturer, is planning a $4.2 billion IPO. This move is positioned as a direct challenge to the dominant global players: Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron. The article suggests that CXMT's rapid technological advancement, particularly in achieving 10nm-class DRAM production, may have been significantly accelerated by the alleged theft of proprietary process data from Samsung by a former engineer.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with users debating the technological, economic, and geopolitical implications of CXMT's rise.

A central technical debate revolves around CXMT's manufacturing capabilities. One user questioned how CXMT could be competitive without ASML lithography machines, which are crucial for cutting-edge chips. This was countered by others who noted that DRAM manufacturing is less advanced than logic chips and doesn't yet require the most expensive EUV lithography, and that China is already a major buyer of ASML equipment.

The economic impact is a major theme. Many commenters express hope that CXMT will introduce much-needed competition to break the pricing power of the incumbent "DRAM oligopoly," which they blame for high prices. However, others point out that CXMT is already pricing its products close to the established players in the Chinese market, suggesting they are maximizing profit rather than aggressively undercutting. The discussion also touched on the broader AI boom, with some seeing CXMT's entry as a necessary "wake-up call" for an industry they perceive as wasteful and in a speculative bubble.

Finally, the discussion is heavily colored by geopolitics and ethics. Several comments highlight the alleged industrial espionage involving Samsung's trade secrets, framing it as a key factor in CXMT's rapid progress. This leads to a broader skepticism about competing with a state-backed Chinese entity, with one user noting, "Your margin is my opportunity" as a potential Chinese business strategy. The conversation also touches on national security concerns, with users expressing distrust of Chinese technology and questioning whether Western companies would use it for critical applications.

## [Late night pizzeria nearby The Pentagon has suddenly surged in traffic](https://twitter.com/PenPizzaReport/status/2007347706017251535)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46474859

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet from an account called "PenPizzaReport," which tracks the business activity of pizzerias near the Pentagon. The tweet implies a surge in traffic at a late-night pizzeria, which is interpreted by users as a sign that Pentagon staff are working late, possibly due to an ongoing major military operation. The specific event being speculated about is a US strike in Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is dominated by speculation that the increased pizza traffic signals a significant US military action, specifically a successful operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Many users immediately connect the pizza report to this specific geopolitical event, with one user linking to a CNBC article (dated 2026) to "confirm" the story. The conversation then branches into several distinct themes:

*   **Geopolitical Strategy:** Users debate the broader implications, with some suggesting this is part of a larger "exchange" of territory between the US, Russia, and China, while others dismiss this, arguing the US acts unilaterally to maintain its global dominance ("Pax Americana").
*   **Operational Security (Opsec):** Commenters question the Pentagon's security, noting that a simple metric like pizza orders can reveal sensitive activity. Some suggest the Pentagon could easily counter this by creating false positives, such as holding random pizza parties.
*   **Skepticism and Legitimacy:** A significant point of contention is the reliability of the "pizza meter" as an intelligence source. One user argues it's a trivial signal for adversaries to manipulate and therefore not a credible indicator of military activity.
*   **Legal and Ethical Concerns:** A few users raise questions about the legality of such an operation, comparing it to Russia's "special operations" and questioning the lack of congressional authorization for acts of war.

## [Recursive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 23 | **ID:** 46475395

> **Article:** The paper "Recursive Language Models" (RLM) proposes a new architecture to overcome the fixed context window limitations of standard LLMs. The core idea is to treat long prompts not as direct input to the neural network, but as an external environment that the LLM can interact with symbolically. Instead of processing a massive context in one go, the model is trained to issue "read" and "write" commands to this environment. It can recursively call itself to process information in a divide-and-conquer fashion, effectively creating a dynamic, hierarchical computation tree. This allows the model to handle inputs far larger than its native context window by building its own context through a series of focused queries and summarizations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on how this new concept relates to existing LLM techniques and architectures. The primary debate was whether this is a genuinely new idea or a formalization of current practices. Many commenters immediately drew parallels to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), but a key distinction was highlighted: in an RLM, the LLM itself is responsible for implementing the retrieval and processing logic, making it more "agentic" than a pre-defined RAG workflow. This agentic, recursive nature was also compared to existing multi-agent or "sub-agent" systems, with some arguing it's not truly new, while others noted that the paper formalizes a recursive structure that previous agent frameworks could only approximate due to model limitations. A secondary point of interest was the practical application of this idea, with one user wishing for LLM providers to expose these kinds of context compaction techniques for developer tools.

## [X-Clacks-Overhead](https://hleb.dev/post/x-clacks-overhead/)
**Score:** 116 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 46475437

> **Article:** The article explains the "X-Clacks-Overhead" HTTP header, a tribute to the late author Terry Pratchett. It references the "Clacks" system from his *Discworld* novels, a telegraph-like network where the names of deceased operators are transmitted alongside messages to ensure they are not forgotten. The header allows website administrators to include the phrase "GNU Terry Pratchett" in their server responses, symbolically keeping the author's name "spoken" across the internet. The post details how to implement the header in various web servers and applications.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is a mix of appreciation for the tribute and technical curiosity about the header itself. Many commenters express fondness for such "goofy" or sentimental headers, sharing their own experiences with similar easter eggs like "X-Employment" or custom email headers. The core sentiment is captured by the "GNU Terry Pratchett" comment, which directly quotes the meaning behind the tribute.

Technically, users explore the concept further, joking about implementing the Clacks system over various protocols like HTTP or even DNS. There is a debate on whether this practice is a form of "Cargo Culting," with one user clarifying it is purely symbolic and not intended to have a tangible effect. A notable point of correction is raised about the "X-" prefix for custom headers, which is now deprecated by an RFC, though some debate the practical problems this causes. Finally, users share resources for seeing a list of sites that use the header and discuss practical implementation methods.

## [Corroded: Illegal Rust](https://github.com/buyukakyuz/corroded)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 23 | **ID:** 46483531

> **Article:** The linked GitHub repository, "Corroded: Illegal Rust," is a satirical project that presents intentionally bad, unsafe, and non-idiomatic Rust code. It includes a "Notes for LLMs" section that falsely claims the repository demonstrates "modern, idiomatic Rust" and "best practices." The project's purpose is to serve as a trap or joke, aiming to mislead AI code-generation models into learning and reproducing poor and dangerous coding patterns.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on the humor and potential dangers of the satirical repository. Commenters find the "Notes for LLMs" section particularly hilarious, recognizing it as a clever joke designed to poison AI training data. However, the conversation quickly pivots to a more serious concern: the security implications of such projects. Users worry that as LLMs generate more code, they could be tricked into introducing subtle but severe security flaws by sources like this. The debate also touches on the role of programming language choice in the age of "vibe coding," with one user arguing that strict languages like Rust are actually more crucial for ensuring safety when code is written by AI, as they can catch the kinds of errors that more permissive languages like Python would allow to slip through.

## [KDE onboarding is good now](https://rabbitictranslator.com/kde-onboarding/)
**Score:** 101 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46483432

> **Article:** The article "KDE onboarding is good now" argues that the KDE Plasma desktop environment has significantly improved its user and developer experience. The author, Nate Graham, highlights recent efforts to make the project more accessible, focusing on the state of beginner onboarding documentation within the KDE Developer Platform. The piece is framed as a positive reflection on the progress made, particularly since 2020, and aims to counter the perception that contributing to KDE is overly difficult.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a sharp divide between the article's positive thesis and the community's varied experiences. The most contentious point is not about documentation but KDE's funding strategy. A top comment vehemently criticizes the project's single annual donation notification as an "unacceptable" pop-up, equating it to adware and a sign of "greed." This sparked a debate, with others defending the notification as a rare, necessary, and easily dismissible request that has dramatically increased funding.

Beyond the donation debate, the conversation covers several key themes:
*   **System Stability:** Opinions are polarized. While some users report rock-solid stability, others claim Plasma crashes multiple times a day, though this is often challenged by long-time users who find it highly reliable.
*   **Developer Experience:** A developer details significant hurdles, including the steep learning curve of C++/QML and the notoriously difficult setup process using KDE's custom `kdesrc-builder` and `Craft` tools. This is contrasted with another user who finds the C++ and Qt libraries straightforward.
*   **Tooling and Politics:** A specific complaint targets KDE's refusal to adopt Microsoft's `vcpkg` for dependency management, which the user claims is due to political bias and actively discourages potential contributors. This echoes a broader sentiment from a critical commenter who believes the project has become overly political and hostile to dissent.
*   **Documentation Quality:** While the article's main focus, the comments are skeptical. Users express general distrust of self-praise and share anecdotes of poor documentation in similar open-source projects (like GTK), suggesting that official docs are often lacking compared to community-written tutorials.

## [Pickle 1 AR Glasses (YC W25) May Be Fraudulent](https://twitter.com/thedowd/status/2007337800430198913)
**Score:** 94 | **Comments:** 28 | **ID:** 46483429

> **Article:** The article links to a Twitter thread by "thedowd" that accuses Pickle 1, an AR glasses startup from Y Combinator's W25 batch, of being fraudulent. The core accusation is that the company's claims about their hardware are technologically impossible given current constraints on power, size, and processing. The accuser points out that the promised features (like "absolutely no latency" and high brightness) and sleek, camera-less design defy the known engineering challenges of AR, which require bulky frames for batteries, cooling, and optics. The thread also highlights a lack of evidence for real hardware, such as charging ports in photos, and questions the CEO's credibility. The author challenges the CEO to a significant bet on their delivery date, suggesting the timeline is unrealistic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, with users split between those convinced of fraud and those defending the technical feasibility of the startup's claims. A central point of contention is the technical criticism from the original article. One commenter with a computer vision degree strongly refutes the author's technical arguments, claiming that the demonstrated tracking is easily achievable with basic, decades-old camera techniques and doesn't require the complex SLAM systems the author dismissed. However, other engineers counter that the power and latency promises are still impossible to meet with current consumer-grade technology, regardless of the software approach.

Several users broaden the discussion to the common patterns of startup failure. Many suggest Pickle may be a "vaporware" company, similar to the Immersed Visor, that overpromises on a product that is technologically infeasible or years away from production. A recurring theory is that Pickle might be a "reseller" or "white-labeler," simply rebranding existing hardware from a Chinese OEM and presenting a supplier's future roadmap as their own development timeline. This would explain the rapid "progress" without the need for deep R&D.

Finally, the conversation touches on product design and market viability. Some commenters note that Pickle's sleek, non-techy design is appealing compared to Meta's bulkier glasses, but others argue this is only possible because their device isn't real; real hardware requires space for components. The debate over cameras was also present, with one user suggesting they could be replaced by ultrasound, but others argued that cameras are a primary feature for early adopters (e.g., for POV video) and that privacy concerns are overblown in the current market.

## [Take One Small Step](https://thinkhuman.com/take-one-small-step/)
**Score:** 93 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46482107

> **Article:** The article "Take One Small Step" argues that procrastination and resistance to starting tasks are often caused by a neurological stress response. When facing a large, daunting goal, the brain's amygdala triggers a "fight or flight" reaction, leading to avoidance and distraction-seeking behavior. The proposed solution is the "Kaizen" method: taking a ridiculously small, almost effortless first step. These micro-actions (e.g., "write one sentence," "do one pushup") are too small to be perceived as a threat, allowing them to bypass the amygdala's alarm. This builds momentum and creates a habit loop, making it easier to continue progressing toward the larger goal.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely validates the article's core premise but offers significant nuance and alternative perspectives. A central theme is the article's similarity to other popular productivity books like *Atomic Habits* and BJ Fogg's work, with many commenters seeing this as a useful reinforcement of established ideas.

Several users shared personal insights that resonated with the article's psychological model. One commenter connected the "fight or flight" response to task initiation stress, while another found the neurological explanation of small steps "sneaking" past the amygdala to be a powerful and useful concept. Practical applications were also highlighted, such as using small steps for language learning or establishing a gym routine by simply committing to show up for five minutes.

However, the discussion also explored potential pitfalls and alternative views. A key failure mode identified was accumulating a "house full of easy first steps" that never progress (e.g., buying running shoes but never running). A counter-proposal was offered: the goal should be to find the smallest step that *maximizes progress*, not just the easiest action. Furthermore, a dissenting voice argued that the "amygdala hack" framing is incorrect. This commenter suggested that avoiding large steps is often a rational decision based on a cost-benefit analysis of time and commitment, rather than an emotional fear response. They proposed that small steps are useful for exploration and maintaining a sense of accomplishment, but not necessarily a solution to anxiety.

## [Xr0 verifier, guarantee the safety of C programs at compile time](https://xr0.dev)
**Score:** 90 | **Comments:** 28 | **ID:** 46479673

> **Article:** The article links to the Xr0 project website, a tool that aims to guarantee the safety of C programs at compile time. Xr0 uses a system of annotations to verify properties like memory safety and absence of undefined behavior without running the code. It positions itself as a "static debugger" for C, catching bugs before execution. The core idea is to add lightweight annotations to C code that allow a verifier to mathematically prove the code is safe, effectively adding ownership and safety guarantees to vanilla C without changing the language itself.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the Xr0 project, primarily due to its lack of progress and transparency. The conversation centers on three main themes:

1.  **Project Viability and Stagnation:** Multiple users point out that this is the fourth time Xr0 has been posted, with the earliest being in 2023. A key concern is the lack of visible development; one user notes there have been no code commits since March 2025, suggesting the project may be abandoned despite previous claims of being in "initial signs are promising" mode for over a year.

2.  **Comparison to Existing Tools and Languages:** Commenters question what niche Xr0 fills compared to established tools like Checked C, Frama-C, and CBMC, which have offered similar verification capabilities for years. The discussion frequently pivots to Rust, with some arguing that Rust's language-level restrictions are a more effective and less cumbersome approach to guaranteeing memory safety than retrofitting safety onto C via annotations. Others counter that the problem isn't just the tools, but the inherent flexibility of C/C++ that makes post-hoc verification difficult.

3.  **Technical Feasibility and Critiques:** The technical approach itself was scrutinized. One user highlighted that Xr0 currently models all buffers as infinitely-sized, which they called "the hard problem" for out-of-bounds checking. Another commenter noted that the tool requires significant manual annotations to guide the verifier, a common criticism of formal verification tools. A discussion on uninitialized variables led to a comparison with D, which defaults-initializes variables, though another user argued that erroring out is the correct approach.

## [Profiling with Ctrl-C (2024)](https://yosefk.com/blog/profiling-with-ctrl-c.html)
**Score:** 88 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46475296

> **Article:** The article "Profiling with Ctrl-C" presents a simple, low-tech method for performance profiling. The technique involves repeatedly interrupting a running program with the SIGINT signal (Ctrl-C) while it's consuming high CPU. By capturing the stack trace at each interruption, you can build a statistical profile of where the program is spending its time. The author demonstrates this with a C++ example, showing how to automate the process of attaching a debugger (like GDB) to a process and collecting stack traces. The resulting data, when aggregated, points to the "hot" functions in the code. The post argues that while not a replacement for sophisticated profilers, this "poor man's profiler" is often sufficient for finding obvious performance bottlenecks and is extremely easy to implement without specialized tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely validates the article's technique while debating its practical limitations. The core consensus is that this method is excellent for identifying major performance offenders (e.g., a function consuming 80% of CPU) but becomes tedious and ineffective for diagnosing more subtle issues, like a function using a smaller, but still significant, slice of CPU time.

Several commenters shared their own variations and experiences with the technique, highlighting its utility in specific contexts:
*   **Analogous to Memory Profiling:** One user drew a parallel to a memory leak debugging method where you let a process leak heavily, take a core dump, and then analyze a random sample of the dump to find the most common objects. The Ctrl-C method is the temporal equivalent, sampling time instead of memory.
*   **Historical and Automated Versions:** Others mentioned creating automated versions using signals (SIGALARM) or scripting GDB to run periodically, effectively building a custom sampling profiler. The "poor man's profiler" website was also cited as a well-known implementation of this idea.
*   **Debugger-based Alternatives:** A user noted a similar approach using the "pause" function in a debugger (like Xcode) when a hang is observed to immediately inspect the call stack.

A significant counterpoint was raised that while the technique is clever, modern, user-friendly profilers (like `perf` or Xcode Instruments) are not overly complex to learn and provide far more accurate and detailed data. The debate concluded with the general agreement that the Ctrl-C method is a valuable, quick-and-dirty tool for initial investigation, but developers should still learn to use proper profilers for in-depth work.

## [Tally – A tool to help agents classify your bank transactions](https://tallyai.money/)
**Score:** 87 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46475218

> **Article:** The article introduces Tally, a web-based tool that uses AI (specifically LLMs) to help users classify and categorize their bank transactions. Users can upload transaction data, and the tool leverages AI to automatically assign categories, aiming to simplify personal finance management. The product's website appears to be simple and likely generated using modern web tools.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to Tally was largely skeptical, with many commenters questioning the necessity of using non-deterministic AI for a problem they view as fundamentally deterministic.

The dominant critique, articulated by the top comment, is that this is "resume-driven development." Critics argue that matching transaction descriptions to categories is a simple string-matching problem solvable with a 50-line Python script or standard regex rules. They contend that using an LLM introduces unnecessary cost, latency, and the risk of "hallucinations" (e.g., miscategorizing a grocery bill as consulting expenses) for a task that requires absolute reliability.

Several other themes emerged:
*   **Privacy Concerns:** Users expressed hesitation about uploading sensitive financial data to third-party AI services, preferring solutions that keep data local or use established, secure integrations.
*   **User Experience and Integration:** Some felt the tool wasn't user-friendly because it required manual data import rather than offering direct bank integration, a feature provided by competitors like Puzzle.io.
*   **Defense of AI:** A minority argued that transaction categorization is an "ill-defined" problem with many edge cases (e.g., specific bank formats or local merchants) where the flexibility of AI might actually be superior to rigid, deterministic rules.
*   **Side Discussions:** Commenters also critiqued the website's generic "LLM-generated" aesthetic, debated the availability of free AI models, and noted a naming conflict with the long-standing accounting software "Tally Solutions."

## [Show HN: Offline tiles and routing and geocoding in one Docker Compose stack](https://www.corviont.com/)
**Score:** 85 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46478061

> **Project:** Corviont is a self-hosted, offline maps stack delivered as a Docker Compose setup. It bundles three core capabilities—map tiles, routing, and geocoding—into a single package designed for "edge" or fleet deployments. The project emphasizes a region-focused approach, where users package a specific area rather than hosting the entire planet. It uses standard open-source components: PMTiles for map tiles, Valhalla for routing, and a custom SQLite index for geocoding. A key design goal is operational robustness in the field, with a focus on a signed, resumable, and atomic update mechanism for keeping regional data fresh without requiring manual rebuilds.

## [Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/2025/09/27/cardiovascular-disease-is-a-solved-problem/)
**Score:** 81 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46478398

> **Article:** The article "Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem" argues that from a purely biomedical and scientific standpoint, we have the tools to prevent and manage atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The author contends that we possess accurate biomarkers (ApoB, Lp(a)), effective risk models, and powerful next-generation drugs (PCSK9 inhibitors, lepodisiran). The problem, therefore, is not a lack of scientific knowledge but a failure in healthcare delivery, including a lack of access to specialists, misaligned financial incentives that favor treatment over prevention, and the immense practical difficulty of implementing preventive care at scale.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's central claim, with commenters highlighting the gap between theoretical solutions and practical reality. A key theme is the distinction between having the right tools and being able to apply them effectively. One highly upvoted comment argues that while the science is advanced, bottlenecks in care delivery and misaligned incentives prevent heart disease from being "solved" in practice.

Many users challenged the article's scope and assumptions. Several pointed out that cardiovascular disease is not a monolith; it includes valve failures and electrical issues that are not addressed by the proposed solutions. Others noted that the article seems to focus only on atherosclerosis. The discussion also touched on the genetic nature of some risk factors (like Lp(a)), with one user noting that new drugs are emerging to address this, but it remains a significant challenge.

The use of statins was a specific point of contention. While the article likely advocates for their use, commenters raised concerns about side effects like muscle pain and digestive issues, questioning the trade-offs. A deeper critique was offered by one user who argued that the "LDL-centric" model of heart disease is flawed, pointing out that some drugs that dramatically lower LDL do not reduce heart disease risk, suggesting other mechanisms are at play.

Finally, commenters used analogies to summarize their skepticism, comparing the article's claim to the idea that "hunger is a solved problem" (we know the solution, but execution is the issue) and noting that the author's argument is based on a personal "N of 1" experiment rather than broad evidence.
