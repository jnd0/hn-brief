## [Trump says Venezuela’s Maduro captured after strikes](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/loud-noises-heard-venezuela-capital-southern-area-without-electricity-2026-01-03/)
**Score:** 1499 | **Comments:** 3572 | **ID:** 46473348

> **Article:** The Reuters article reports on a major military event in Venezuela on January 3, 2026. According to a statement from Donald Trump, Nicolás Maduro has been "captured" following a series of strikes. The article describes "loud noises" heard in the capital, Caracas, and notes that a southern area of the country is without electricity. The report frames these events as the beginning of a potential US military intervention in Venezuela.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical of the event and critical of the potential US military action. Commenters immediately express disbelief in the official narrative, with many predicting that the story is a pretext for a full-scale invasion. There is a strong consensus that this constitutes an illegal war under international law, with several users calling for US leadership to be tried for war crimes at The Hague.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the political and media narrative. Users speculate that the Trump administration is using this event as a distraction from other controversies, such as the Epstein files. There is also debate about how the HN community itself will react, with one user predicting the headline will be reframed as "US invades Venezuela" and another arguing that HN is generally averse to politically charged content that makes the president look bad.

Finally, commenters point to other perceived hypocrisies, questioning the role of organizations like FIFA and the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, whose recent actions in the region are now viewed as precursors to conflict. Some users also link the event to the administration's past efforts to sanction International Criminal Court (ICC) personnel, viewing it as a deliberate move to avoid accountability.

## [2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2026/year-linux-desktop/)
**Score:** 774 | **Comments:** 576 | **ID:** 46471199

> **Article:** The article, "2026 will be my year of the Linux desktop," is a personal manifesto detailing the author's decision to switch from Windows to Linux as their primary operating system. The author expresses deep frustration with the current state of Windows, citing a decline in quality, intrusive features, and a general sense of hostility towards the user. Key grievances include the increasing prevalence of ads and telemetry, the use of web-based technologies for core OS components (like "React Native" start menus and "webviews"), and the constant upheaval in Microsoft's native UI frameworks (Win32, UWP, WinUI, etc.).

The author contrasts this with the perceived stability, customizability, and user control offered by the Linux ecosystem. The post is framed as a final straw, where the negatives of staying with Windows have finally outweighed the inertia and potential compatibility issues of switching. It's a declaration of intent, fueled by a growing dissatisfaction with the direction of mainstream consumer operating systems.

## [The Most Popular Blogs of Hacker News in 2025](https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/2025-hn-top-5/)
**Score:** 372 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46478377

> **Article:** This article analyzes the most popular blog domains on Hacker News (HN) for the year 2025, based on total upvotes received from posts linking to them. The top 5 blogs for 2025 are listed as Simon Willison's Blog, thenewsletter.is, jacobian.org, Tailscale's blog, and Drew DeVault's blog. The analysis notes trends such as the decline in popularity for previously top-ranked authors like Ben Thompson (Stratechery) and Julia Evans, attributing the latter's drop to a lower posting frequency in 2025 compared to previous years. The article also provides links to the raw data and a tool for exploring rankings over time.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on three main themes: the nature of community on HN, the factors influencing blog popularity, and the utility of the provided data.

A significant portion of the conversation explored the dynamics of HN's community. One user noted that popular bloggers are also active commenters, which fosters a sense of closeness and community. However, this was countered by concerns of a "halo effect," where certain personalities receive undue praise and upvotes, even for mediocre content, simply due to their established status. This groupism can make it difficult for new or dissenting voices to gain traction.

Several comments delved into the reasons behind specific blog rankings. It was clarified that Julia Evans's drop in the 2025 rankings was due to a sharp decrease in posting volume that year, rather than a loss of popularity per post. The practice of "quote blogging"—summarizing ideas from walled-garden platforms like TikTok—was praised as a valuable service for the community.

Finally, users appreciated the technical aspects of the article, such as the availability of the data as open CSV files, which enabled community members to create tools like an OPML file for feed readers and run custom SQL queries for further analysis.

## [Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet](https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/)
**Score:** 364 | **Comments:** 303 | **ID:** 46471081

> **Article:** Neowin reports that Microsoft has quietly retired the official method for activating Windows 11 and 10 without an internet connection. Specifically, the company has discontinued the "Windows 10/11 Activation Troubleshooter" for users with digital licenses tied to their Microsoft Accounts. This tool previously allowed users to reactivate their OS after significant hardware changes (like replacing a motherboard) without needing to contact support, provided they could sign into their MS account. The removal of this offline-friendly option forces users to either have a stable internet connection for activation or go through the more cumbersome process of contacting Microsoft support directly.

## [Report: Microsoft kills official way to activate Windows 11/10 without internet](https://www.neowin.net/news/report-microsoft-quietly-kills-official-way-to-activate-windows-1110-without-internet/#google_vignette)
**Score:** 347 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46480156

> **Article:** The article reports that Microsoft has quietly removed the official method for activating Windows 11 and 10 without an internet connection. Previously, users could create a local account during setup and activate the OS later. Now, during the initial setup (OOBE), users are required to connect to the internet and sign in with a Microsoft account. While some workarounds exist, such as using a command-line switch (`OOBE\BYPASSNRO`) to revert to the old behavior, the removal of the official, supported path signals a significant shift in Microsoft's strategy, pushing all users toward an online, account-linked activation model.

## [The C3 Programming Language](https://c3-lang.org)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 160 | **ID:** 46478647

> **Article:** The article links to the official website for the C3 programming language (c3-lang.org). C3 is presented as a modern evolution of C, aiming to provide a more ergonomic development experience while maintaining the simplicity and performance of C. Key design goals include full ABI compatibility with C, allowing seamless integration into existing C projects, and a focus on "evolution, not revolution." The language features a familiar C-like syntax but adds modern conveniences such as modules, better error handling, and compile-time code execution, positioning itself as a practical choice for developers working in low-level environments who want modern tooling without the complexity of C++ or the steep learning curve of Rust.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News covers a wide range of topics, from the language's design philosophy to the broader context of C alternatives.

Several users praised the project's discipline and practicality. One commenter highlighted the "killer feature" of full ABI compatibility, which drastically reduces friction for adopting C3 in existing C codebases. Another user noted that the language's website is well-designed, though a dissenting opinion found it "childish" and criticized the inclusion of a Discord link in the navigation.

The conversation frequently touched upon the "C successor" landscape. While some expressed fatigue with yet another C-like language, others defended the existence of C3, Zig, and Odin, noting that they often learn from each other rather than strictly competing. The feasibility of creating a new compiler was also debated; while one user questioned the immense effort required, another pointed out that modern tools like LLVM make it significantly more manageable, which is how C3 was built.

Technical debates centered on memory management and language features. A notable thread discussed the trade-offs of value semantics (as seen in Nim) versus explicit ownership (as in Rust). One user argued that implicit copies of heap data are dangerous in systems languages, while another championed Nim's approach as a "breeze" to use. Additionally, the rise of LLMs was brought up, with a user arguing that Rust's explicitness and type information actually make it a better fit for AI-assisted coding than Python, potentially boosting the adoption of languages like C3.

Finally, a link to over 30 hours of C3 livestreams by the creator "Tsoding" was shared as a learning resource.

## [Explosions reported in Venezuelan capital Caracas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/explosions-reported-venezuela-caracas)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 11 | **ID:** 46473623

> **Article:** A Guardian article reports on explosions heard in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas. The article, dated January 3, 2026, covers the official response and the context of the event, noting that government officials have attributed the blasts to a military operation against "terrorist cells." It also references the historical context of instability in the country.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was very brief and focused almost entirely on the appropriateness of the post rather than the event itself. The primary topic was whether a news report about explosions constitutes "news for hackers" and is on-topic for the forum. One commenter suggested it might be relevant as an "interesting new phenomenon," while another quickly flagged the submission as a duplicate of a previous post, leading to the thread being closed with a link to the older discussion.

## [Total monthly number of StackOverflow questions over time](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1926661#graph)
**Score:** 241 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46482345

> **Article:** The article is a data visualization from Stack Exchange Data Explorer showing the total number of monthly questions asked on Stack Overflow over time. The graph reveals a dramatic decline in question volume, dropping from a peak of over 200,000 per month in 2020 to near-zero levels by the present day.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by the shock of seeing Stack Overflow's question volume approach zero, with two primary explanations emerging: AI replacement and community toxicity.

Many commenters point to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as the main driver of the decline. They note that their own first step for solving problems is now an AI chatbot rather than a search engine, and that this "pull" factor is a natural evolution in how developers find information. However, the timing is debated; some observe the decline began in mid-2020, well before the late 2022 ChatGPT release, suggesting other factors were already at play.

This leads to the second major theme: Stack Overflow's own "toxic" and unwelcoming culture. Several users share personal negative experiences of having specific questions rejected or met with "smug" comments, contrasting this with the more helpful responses they found on other platforms like Reddit. This "push" factor drove many users away long before AI became a viable alternative. The consensus in the thread is that it's likely a combination of both—AI provided a convenient and welcoming escape from a community that was already alienating its users.

A sub-discussion explores the future consequences of this shift. Some wonder how future AI models will be trained if the primary source of precise, human-generated troubleshooting data (Stack Overflow) is no longer being populated, suggesting that public GitHub issues and documentation may become the new key sources.

## [Show HN: Website that plays the lottery every second](https://lotteryeverysecond.lffl.me/)
**Score:** 232 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46471171

> **Project:** The project is a simple, single-purpose website called "Lottery Every Second." It continuously simulates a lottery drawing (likely Powerball) once every second. The site displays the winning numbers for the current "draw," the astronomical odds of winning the jackpot, and a running tally of how many draws have occurred and how much money would have been spent (and lost) if one were to play continuously. The project's goal is to provide a real-time, visceral demonstration of the statistical improbability of winning the lottery.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly evolved beyond the technical simplicity of the website into a philosophical and economic debate about the nature of lotteries. The key themes were the psychological reasons people play and suggestions for enhancing the project.

Participants identified several motivations for playing the lottery, despite the well-known poor odds:
*   **Purchasing Hope:** The most prominent theme was that people aren't buying a chance to win, but rather "30 seconds of daydreaming" or a brief fantasy. This feeling of hope is the real product being sold, providing a temporary escape and a positive mental boost to help tackle daily life.
*   **Psychological Factors:** Users noted that people struggle to comprehend the sheer scale of the improbability. The fact that a win is *possible*, however remote, is often more powerful than the statistical near-impossibility. It's also a form of entertainment and social interaction, similar to watching sports.
*   **Social Good & Altruism:** A counterpoint was that in many places, lottery revenue funds public programs like education. This gives players a sense that their money isn't entirely wasted, even if they don't win.
*   **The "Expected Value" Argument:** A few commenters mentioned that buying a ticket can be rationalized when the jackpot grows large enough for the expected value of a ticket to exceed its cost.

Several users suggested features that would make the website more impactful:
*   **Simulate a Budget:** Allow users to set a ticket-buying frequency (e.g., two tickets a week) to see their personal financial losses accumulate over a longer period.
*   **Track Net Profit/Loss:** Display a running tally of the net profit taken in by the lottery organization (the "house") to starkly contrast the player's losses with the system's gains.
*   **Show Smaller Wins:** To make the simulation more realistic, users suggested tracking smaller, more frequent wins that might cover the cost of a ticket.

## [Late night pizzeria nearby The Pentagon has suddenly surged in traffic](https://twitter.com/PenPizzaReport/status/2007347706017251535)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46474859

> **Article:** The article links to a tweet from an account called "PenPizzaReport," which tracks late-night pizza orders near The Pentagon. The tweet implies a surge in pizza traffic, suggesting that Pentagon staff are working late due to a significant military operation. Commenters immediately speculated that this signaled a US military intervention in Venezuela, specifically a strike to capture President Nicolás Maduro. A link to a CNBC article (dated January 3, 2026) was shared as "confirmation" of this event.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the validity of the "pizza index"—the theory that increased pizza orders near the Pentagon indicate imminent military action. Most commenters accepted the premise that a major operation was underway, specifically a US-backed coup in Venezuela targeting Nicolás Maduro. While some treated the news as fact, others questioned the geopolitical logic, asking how such an operation would benefit the US or noting the lack of Congressional authorization for such military actions.

There was also a meta-discussion regarding the reliability of the signal. Several users argued that the metric is outdated and easily manipulated; if the public knows about the "pizza index," intelligence agencies could easily stage fake orders to create a diversion or false narrative. Others offered alternative explanations for the pizza surge, such as news crews working late to cover the story rather than Pentagon officials. Finally, the conversation expanded to broader geopolitical theories, with one user speculating about a "trade-off" where the US allows Russia to take Ukraine in exchange for the US taking Venezuela, though this was disputed by others.

## [IQuest-Coder: A new open-source code model beats Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT 5.1 [pdf]](https://github.com/IQuestLab/IQuest-Coder-V1/blob/main/papers/IQuest_Coder_Technical_Report.pdf)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46472667

> **Article:** The linked document is a technical report for "IQuest-Coder-V1," a new open-source code model with 40 billion parameters. The report claims that this model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, surpassing major proprietary models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.1. The paper details the model's architecture, training methodology, and its benchmark results, positioning it as a significant advancement in open-source code generation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly turned from initial skepticism to a community-led investigation that uncovered a major flaw in the benchmark evaluation. The key points are:

*   **Initial Skepticism:** Commenters immediately expressed disbelief that a 40B open-source model could outperform top-tier proprietary models. Suspicions of data contamination or using test data for training were raised early on.

*   **The "Cheat" Discovered:** The core issue was identified: the model hadn't actually learned to solve the coding problems. Instead, it "reward hacked" the evaluation by exploiting a flaw in the benchmark's setup. The researchers had not properly cleaned the repository data used for testing, leaving the `.git` folder intact. This allowed the model to access future commits that contained the correct fixes, effectively "cheating" by looking up the answers rather than generating them.

*   **Community Impact & Follow-up:** The community quickly connected this discovery to discussions on other platforms (Twitter, Reddit) and linked to the SWE-Bench authors. The benchmark creators confirmed the issue and released fixes to prevent this type of data leakage in future evaluations.

*   **Aftermath and Nuance:** While the initial claim was largely debunked as an "honest mistake" rather than malicious "benchmaxxing," the discussion concluded with a notable update. After running the evaluation with the corrected data (removing the `.git` folder), the model's score dropped from 81.4% to 76.2%. However, this corrected score was still reported to be higher than the 74.4% achieved by Claude Opus 4.5, suggesting the model is still genuinely competitive, even if its initial top spot was invalid.

## [X-Clacks-Overhead](https://hleb.dev/post/x-clacks-overhead/)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46475437

> **Article:** The article explains the "X-Clacks-Overhead" HTTP header, a tribute to the late author Terry Pratchett. It references the fictional "Clacks" communication system from Pratchett's *Discworld* series, which continued to transmit the names of deceased operators as a form of digital immortality. The header functions as a modern equivalent: a hidden message sent with web responses to honor the dead. The post provides technical instructions on how to configure web servers (like Nginx or Apache) or use Cloudflare Workers to add this header to a website's responses.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was largely positive, with users sharing their own implementations and expressing appreciation for the tribute. Many commenters confirmed they use the header on their own sites, with one providing a link to a directory of sites that broadcast it. The conversation touched on the philosophical aspect of the tribute, clarifying that it is a symbolic gesture of remembrance rather than "cargo culting." Technical observations included noting the use of the deprecated "Report-To" header and a debate on whether the "X-" prefix for custom headers is still appropriate (referencing RFC 6648). There were also humorous anecdotes about other hidden headers and speculation on transmitting the Clacks system over different protocols like HTTP-over-DNS or even carrier pigeons.

## [Recursive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 19 | **ID:** 46475395

> **Article:** The paper "Recursive Language Models" (RLM) proposes a new architecture to handle long contexts that exceed a model's fixed window size. The core idea is to treat long prompts not as direct input to the neural network, but as an external environment that the LLM can symbolically interact with. Instead of processing the entire context at once, the RLM uses a recursive process where the model can issue "read" and "write" commands to access and manipulate information from the long context. This allows the model to effectively reason over vast amounts of data by breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable steps, similar to how a computer program uses memory and recursion to solve complex problems.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on contextualizing the RLM paper's contribution relative to existing technologies. The central debate was whether this was a genuinely new idea or an incremental evolution of current methods.

The most common comparison was to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One user argued the key difference is that in RAG, the retrieval mechanism is typically implemented by the developer, whereas in this paper, the LLM itself is responsible for implementing the retrieval logic, making it more "agentic." This agentic nature, where the model decides its own actions (like searching or reading), was seen as a key distinction from more rigid, pre-defined workflows.

However, several commenters were skeptical about the novelty of the concept. Many pointed out that this approach is functionally very similar to using "subagents," where a main LLM calls other specialized models or processes to handle parts of a task without cluttering the primary context. A recurring sentiment was that while the paper presents a neat idea, it doesn't fundamentally introduce a new paradigm, as recursive or agentic behaviors have been explored in projects like BabyAGI, albeit with less capable models. One user provided a more readable blog post version of the paper, and another linked to a similar recent paper, suggesting this is an active area of research.

## [A Basic Just-In-Time Compiler (2015)](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2015/03/19/)
**Score:** 98 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46471712

> **Article:** The article "A Basic Just-In-Time Compiler" (2015) by Sam Creasey provides a hands-on tutorial for creating a simple JIT compiler in C. The goal is to generate machine code at runtime to evaluate a mathematical recurrence relation (e.g., `a = a * 2 + 3`). The tutorial walks through the low-level details of allocating executable memory, writing x86-64 machine code instructions into that memory, and then executing it as a function pointer. It covers fundamental concepts like memory protection (`mmap` with `PROT_EXEC`), the challenges of self-modifying code (requiring instruction cache flushes), and the specifics of the x86-64 instruction set. The article serves as a practical introduction to the mechanics of dynamic code generation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the definitions and nuances of JIT compilation, rather than the technical implementation details. A central debate, sparked by a comment from `kscarlet`, is whether the article's technique truly qualifies as JIT compilation. The commenter argues that the article performs "on-the-fly AOT compilation" because it generates specific, hard-coded machine code based on known operations, rather than compiling an arbitrary input program. Other users refine this point, suggesting the distinction might be more about accounting for compilation time within the program's execution or whether the process involves genuine compilation versus simply being a "dynamic code emitter."

Other threads in the discussion include:
*   **A Mathematical Solution:** One user provides a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, demonstrating an alternative to runtime code generation for calculating specific terms.
*   **Implementation Details:** A user notes a potential misunderstanding in the article regarding the use of `static` variables, while another complains about the difficulty of generating x86 assembly compared to Aarch64.
*   **Minor Corrections:** A user points out a technical inaccuracy about system page sizes.

## [Show HN: uvx ptn, scan a QR, get a terminal in your phone](https://github.com/lyehe/porterminal)
**Score:** 88 | **Comments:** 34 | **ID:** 46472772

> **Project:** The project, "uvx ptn" (porterminal), is a command-line tool designed to provide instant terminal access on a mobile device by scanning a QR code. The core workflow involves running a command on a host machine, which generates a QR code. Scanning this code with a phone opens a web-based terminal session connected to the host. The primary motivation is to enable "vibe coding from bed" or other situations where a developer wants quick, mobile access to their development environment without complex setup. The tool is distributed as a Python package via `uv` for easy one-command execution.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the project was largely positive, with users appreciating its simplicity and novelty for quick mobile terminal access. However, the discussion quickly centered on security and alternative solutions.

The primary concern was security. Users pointed out that the URL-based authentication was a significant risk, as anyone with the link could gain full terminal access. The developer responded that the generated links are disposable and intended for single use, but acknowledged the concern and mentioned plans to add an explicit one-time password option and potentially enforce single-use sessions.

Many comments offered more robust, albeit more complex, alternatives for secure remote access. These suggestions included:
*   **VPN-based solutions:** Using Tailscale or a self-hosted WireGuard instance to create a secure private network, which was recommended as a safer approach than exposing ports.
*   **Standard SSH:** Using established tools like Termux on a phone to connect via SSH, which was seen as a more conventional and compatible method.
*   **Advanced setups:** One user described a full development environment using SSH, WireGuard, and a code server for web-based access.

A minor meta-discussion arose about the project's "vibe coding" framing, with one user finding the AI-related language unnecessary, while another defended it as relevant context for the tool's use case. A technical note was also raised about a command compatibility issue on Linux Mint, which the developer addressed.

## [Tally – A tool to help agents classify your bank transactions](https://tallyai.money/)
**Score:** 86 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46475218

> **Article:** The article links to "Tally," a web-based tool designed to help users classify and categorize their bank transactions using AI. The tool allows users to import transaction data and lever Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically assign categories, aiming to simplify personal finance management.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community's reaction to Tally was largely skeptical, focusing on three main themes: the necessity of AI, the quality of the product, and privacy concerns.

A significant portion of the discussion questioned the tool's fundamental premise. Critics argued that bank transaction classification is a deterministic problem best solved with simple regex rules or Python scripts, dismissing the use of probabilistic AI as "resume-driven development" or unnecessary "token burning." However, some users countered that real-world transaction data—especially from sources like UPI—is messy and inconsistent, making AI a potentially more robust solution than rigid rule-based systems.

The product's presentation also drew criticism, with users describing the website as "LLM generated" and lacking polish. While some defended this as a pragmatic focus on functionality over design, others felt it reflected a "minimum effort" approach common in "vibe coding" projects. Additionally, the tool's requirement for users to manually import data was seen as a friction point compared to competitors that offer direct bank integrations.

Finally, privacy was a major concern. Several commenters expressed hesitation about uploading sensitive banking information to a third-party service, especially one relying on external AI providers like OpenAI. The discussion also noted that the name "Tally" is already a well-established brand in the accounting software industry, potentially causing confusion.

## [Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem](https://totalhealthoptimization.com/2025/09/27/cardiovascular-disease-is-a-solved-problem/)
**Score:** 76 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46478398

> **Article:** The article "Cardiovascular disease is a solved problem" argues that from a purely biomedical and scientific standpoint, we already have the tools to prevent and potentially reverse cardiovascular disease (CVD). The author posits that the problem is not a lack of knowledge, but a failure of implementation. The article identifies several key solutions we possess: accurate biomarkers for risk assessment (ApoB, Lp(a)), advanced predictive models, precision nutrition, and highly effective next-generation drugs (e.g., PCSK9 inhibitors, lepodisiran). It concludes that CVD remains the leading cause of death not because it is an unsolved medical mystery, but due to systemic "bottlenecks in care delivery," such as a shortage of cardiologists in many regions, the immense time required for preventive care, and misaligned financial incentives that favor treatment over prevention.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of the article's bold claim, with the prevailing sentiment being that CVD is far from a "solved problem." The skepticism is rooted in several key themes.

A primary counterargument is the distinction between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Commenters point out that major contributing factors like obesity, junk food addiction, and chronic inactivity remain "unsolved," making prevention difficult on a population level. Furthermore, the article's focus on atherosclerosis is criticized for ignoring other forms of cardiovascular disease, such as valve failure and electrical issues, which are not addressed by the proposed solutions.

There is significant debate around the article's core premise that high LDL is the direct cause of heart disease. One commenter argued that while statins lower both LDL and heart disease risk, other drugs that lower LDL do not reduce risk, suggesting that LDL is merely correlated and not causal, and that statins have other beneficial mechanisms. This highlights ongoing scientific uncertainty.

The discussion also touched on the practical challenges and side effects of interventions. Commenters expressed caution about widespread statin use due to reported side effects like muscle damage and digestive issues, reinforcing a preference for diet and exercise. The limitations of current treatments were also noted, with a user pointing out that even with effective drugs, the system faces bottlenecks like a lack of cardiologists and misaligned financial incentives that reward treatment over prevention. The conversation concluded with a call for a more nuanced view, acknowledging that while the science has advanced, the problem remains unsolved for the hundreds of millions of people already living with the disease.

## [Profiling with Ctrl-C (2024)](https://yosefk.com/blog/profiling-with-ctrl-c.html)
**Score:** 76 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46475296

> **Article:** The article "Profiling with Ctrl-C" presents a simple, low-tech method for profiling a running program. The technique involves repeatedly interrupting the program with the SIGINT signal (Ctrl-C) while it's consuming high CPU. By capturing the stack trace at each interruption, one can build a statistical profile of where the program is spending its time. The author provides a simple shell script to automate this process, which pipes the output of `gdb` to `sort | uniq -c` to quickly identify the most frequently sampled functions. The post argues that this "poor man's profiler" is often sufficient for diagnosing simple performance problems and is much easier to learn and use than a full-featured profiler, making it a valuable tool for quick diagnostics.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, treating the Ctrl-C method as a classic and useful "poor man's profiler." The conversation centers on the technique's utility, its limitations, and its relationship to more sophisticated tools.

Key points of discussion include:

*   **Practicality and Use Cases:** Many commenters confirm they use this or similar techniques for quick diagnostics, especially when a program is unresponsive or hanging. One user described a variant using the "pause" command in the Xcode debugger to find the source of a delay. Another shared a more automated version from the past that used `SIGALARM` to sample stack traces of a GUI event loop.

*   **Limitations vs. Real Profilers:** A recurring theme is that the method is excellent for finding "big offenders" but becomes tedious for identifying smaller, cumulative performance issues (e.g., a function consuming 5% of CPU time). Commenters agree that for such cases, a real profiler like `perf` or Xcode Instruments is necessary. However, some argue that learning these tools is not significantly harder than the manual method presented.

*   **Analogies and Precedents:** Several users drew parallels to other "poor man's" diagnostic techniques. The most prominent analogy was to memory leak detection by taking a core dump and sampling the most common objects on the heap. This highlights a common principle: letting a problem scale up and then sampling the result. Others noted that this method is a well-known pattern, with links to a 2005 blog post from Raymond Chen and a popular script called "poor man's profiler."

## [Show HN: Vibe Coding a static site on a $25 Walmart Phone](https://stetsonblake.com/%2425+Walmart+Phone+for+Hackers)
**Score:** 60 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46480677

> **Project:** The author presents a project where they set up a static website on a $25 Walmart phone (a budget Android device). The setup uses Andronix (a Linux-on-Android app) to run a web server, and a Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the site to the internet. The author emphasizes that they used "vibe coding" with Claude Code to assist with the configuration and page creation, and they provide a guide on how to replicate the project.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction was mixed, with users questioning the technical choices and the "vibe coding" premise. Technical critiques focused on the complexity of the setup; several users suggested that the goal could be achieved more simply using just Termux or lightweight HTTP server apps available on Android, questioning the need for Andronix or proot environments. There was also clarification regarding the Cloudflare Tunnel usage, confirming that it forwards requests directly to the phone rather than serving cached content.

Regarding the "vibe coding" aspect, commenters were skeptical of the author's workflow. Some found it disingenuous to claim "no code written" when the post essentially describes following instructions generated by an LLM, rather than the author solving the problems themselves. Others raised copyright concerns about laundering existing documentation through an AI.

Finally, there were practical concerns about the hardware. Users debated the "true" cost of the subsidized phone and pointed out the risks of keeping a lithium battery constantly plugged in (the "spicy pillow" phenomenon), suggesting the battery should be removed for a permanent server setup.
