# HN Daily Digest - 2026-01-25

The EU's Digital Markets Act is already producing strange fruit, with BirdyChat claiming the title of the first European chat app to interoperate with WhatsApp. The catch, of course, is that the entire feature hinges on WhatsApp users opting in to receive messages from third-party apps—a requirement so significant that many HN commenters are calling it dead on arrival. This move is less about genuine interoperability and more about regulatory theater, a way for Meta to tick a compliance box without ceding any real ground. It’s a stark reminder that forcing open walled gardens often results in a door that nobody bothers to walk through.

This push for digital independence is a broader theme, with Europe’s strategic goal to end its reliance on US internet technology gaining traction. The discussion there is pragmatic; while replacing commodity software like Microsoft 365 is feasible, untangling from deeply embedded systems like Windows and Active Directory is another beast entirely. The conversation often circles back to a familiar critique: European tech culture is seen as defeatist, burdened by bureaucracy and a lack of risk-taking compared to the US and China. The ambition is clear, but the execution remains a massive question mark.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom is facing its own sovereignty crisis, accused of blatantly violating net neutrality by under-dimensioning its transit access points. The allegations paint a picture of a de facto monopoly strong-arming external services into paying for "fast lanes," a practice that users on the ground confirm results in mysteriously slow websites, especially those behind Cloudflare. The discussion here is less about policy and more about raw frustration, with users sharing war stories of poor service and contemplating alternatives like Starlink, despite its own baggage.

On the hardware front, the Raspberry Pi drag race offers a nostalgic look at a decade of progress, showing the Pi 5 is a staggering 600 times faster than the original. Yet the HN crowd, ever practical, pivoted to the real debate: for most server tasks, a used x86 mini-PC often provides better value, challenging the Pi's reign. The conversation also highlighted the platform's architectural quirks, with some lamenting that newer models have traded simplicity for performance, introducing new headaches like specialized power needs. It’s a classic engineering trade-off, one that older Pi models, now repurposed for niche tasks like printer servers, seem to have navigated better.

This theme of aging hardware finding new life is echoed in the world of satellites, where Albedo’s postmortem on their VLEO mission details both triumphs and failures. The mission successfully captured high-resolution imagery from a very low orbit, but was hampered by a failed onboard computer and Control Moment Gyroscopes, likely due to lubricant issues in the vacuum of space. The company’s founder actively participated in the HN thread, discussing the challenges of supply chain vetting and the balance between startup speed and rigorous testing.

The software world, however, seems to be moving in the opposite direction. Microsoft’s second emergency out-of-band update for Windows 11, released to fix a disastrous Patch Tuesday, has users up in arms about the OS's declining quality. The consensus is that Windows 11 has become bloated and unstable, with users reporting crippling performance issues even on modern SSDs and broken features like the Start Menu search. The criticism has become so severe that some are advocating for a full migration to Linux, with Fedora being a popular choice for those seeking stability and performance.

This pattern of software fragility isn't limited to operating systems. A GitHub issue reveals that NVIDIA's `nvidia-smi` utility hangs indefinitely after exactly 66 days and 12 hours of uptime on certain B200 GPUs. The precision of the failure points to a classic integer overflow bug, likely in a 32-bit counter related to NVLink or system uptime. It’s a sobering reminder that even in high-performance computing, simple timekeeping errors can bring a system to its knees, and debugging issues with a 66-day reproduction cycle is a special kind of hell.

The conversation around trust in our tools continues with an X-ray analysis of a suspicious FTDI USB cable, which revealed a counterfeit using a cheaper, multi-chip solution. While the piece itself was a marketing blog, it sparked a valuable discussion on hardware supply chain risks. Commenters shared their own experiences with untrustworthy components and debated the ethics of FTDI's past actions, which included bricking counterfeit chips via driver updates. The takeaway is clear: in an era of global supply chains, the provenance of even the simplest cable is worth investigating.

Finally, a look at the open-source browser engine Servo shows promising progress, with updates like multiple windows and better caching. This project, along with Ladybird, represents a crucial effort to break the Blink/WebKit duopoly. The discussion highlighted that Servo is now receiving public funding from European sources, adding a layer of sustainability to its mission. While it's still early days, the progress is a welcome sign in a web landscape that desperately needs more diversity.

**Worth watching:** The slow, grinding battle for digital sovereignty in Europe, which will shape everything from cloud providers to chat apps. Also, keep an eye on the open-source silicon movement, where projects like Tiny Tapeout are making chip design accessible to software engineers with open-source tools.
