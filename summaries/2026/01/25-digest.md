The EU’s Digital Markets Act is already producing some spectacularly cynical compliance theater. BirdyChat now claims interoperability with WhatsApp, but the implementation is a masterclass in making a feature dead on arrival. The catch? WhatsApp users must opt-in to receive messages from other apps—a barrier so high it guarantees the feature will be used by almost no one. It’s a perfect example of a regulation forcing open a door, only to have the incumbent bolt it shut from the inside. This isn’t interoperability; it’s a checkbox exercise, likely designed to keep smaller competitors like BirdyChat and Haiket in a state of perpetual obscurity while Meta claims DMA compliance.

This regulatory friction feeds directly into a broader, more urgent theme: Europe’s growing desperation to untangle itself from US tech hegemony. The push for "digital sovereignty" is no longer theoretical. A pilot project in Sweden is simulating digital blackouts, and there’s a concerted push to foster homegrown cloud providers. The motivation is clear—geopolitical instability, corporate surveillance, and the simple fact that profits are flowing to American giants. But the skepticism is palpable. Commenters point to Europe’s bureaucratic inertia and a work culture that can’t compete with the relentless pace of US and Chinese tech. The consensus is that while the goal is necessary, the execution is likely to be a slow, painful mess of regulations and legacy systems.

Meanwhile, the security front is looking increasingly grim. Poland’s energy grid narrowly avoided a blackout after a targeted attack using novel wiper malware, a clear escalation in Russia’s hybrid war against Europe. The incident underscores a painful truth: critical infrastructure is perpetually vulnerable, and air-gapping is often a myth. On the domestic front, the US government’s own tactics are coming under fire. The killing of a man by federal agents in Minneapolis during an immigration operation has sparked outrage, with video evidence contradicting official narratives and fueling fears of militarized law enforcement and eroding civil liberties. It’s a stark reminder that the tools of state power, whether cyber or kinetic, are becoming more aggressive and less accountable.

The quality of our digital infrastructure is crumbling from the inside out. Deutsche Telekom stands accused of throttling the internet by under-provisioning transit access points, forcing content providers into expensive direct contracts or condemning users to a slow lane. It’s a blatant violation of net neutrality principles, and German users are so fed up they’re switching to Starlink. This decay isn’t just in the pipes; it’s in the code. Microsoft’s Windows 11 is a case study in decline, with emergency out-of-band updates needed to fix bugs that made Outlook unusable. Users blame "AI slop" and "vibe coding," lamenting that the OS has become a laggy, web-based mess. Even Gmail’s spam filter, once a hallmark of reliability, is now failing, marking legitimate emails as spam and letting scams through. The message is clear: the tech we rely on is being actively enshittified.

This rot extends to academia and hardware. A 2012 paper in *Management Science*, flawed by a fundamental statistical error, has been cited over 6,000 times, highlighting the replication crisis and the perverse incentives that reward novelty over rigor. In the hardware world, the trust chain is breaking. An X-ray of a suspicious FTDI USB cable revealed a counterfeit chip, a minor example of the supply chain vulnerabilities that enable more sophisticated attacks. And for those pushing hardware to its limits, a haunting bug has emerged: `nvidia-smi` hangs after exactly 66 days and 14 hours on B200 GPUs, a classic integer overflow that forces full cluster restarts. It’s the kind of long-duration, hard-to-reproduce bug that keeps engineers awake at night.

Amidst the decay, there are pockets of resilience and nostalgia. The Raspberry Pi drag race shows a massive performance leap from the Pi 1 to the Pi 5, but the discussion reveals a longing for the simpler, more reliable older models that are still perfect for dedicated tasks. In the browser engine wars, Servo’s steady progress—adding multiple windows and better caching—is a welcome sign of life in a field dominated by Chromium and WebKit, especially as Ladybird makes strides as another independent contender. And for a brief moment of beauty, Ursula K. Le Guin’s poetic rendition of the Tao Te Ching serves as a philosophical antidote to all the technical noise, a reminder that not everything can be optimized or debugged.

**Worth watching:** Europe’s digital sovereignty push. It’s the thread that ties together regulatory battles, infrastructure security, and economic strategy. The outcome will define the next decade of the global tech landscape.
