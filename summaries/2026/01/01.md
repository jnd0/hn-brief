> **Article:** This article, "2025: The Year in LLMs," by Simon Willison, provides a comprehensive retrospective on the rapid advancements in Large Language Models throughout the year. The piece chronicles a shift from model-centric improvements to a focus on agentic workflows, tool integration, and the practical realities of deploying AI in production. Key themes include the rise of "vibe coding" (using LLMs for rapid prototyping), the normalization of AI agents capable of performing complex tasks like deleting files (the "YOLO" era), and the emergence of standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting models to external data and tools. Willison also highlights the increasing accessibility of powerful models, the growing importance of AI-powered CLI tools, and the significant challenges related to AI safety, such as AI psychosis and self-harm, which became more prominent as user bases expanded.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the author for providing an essential and high-quality annual summary that helps them keep pace with the dizzying speed of AI development. Commenters express gratitude for the clarity and insight the article provides.

Several key themes emerge from the conversation:
*   **Practical Application and Safety:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the practicalities and risks of using AI agents. One user shared a detailed guide on using Firejail to sandbox AI coding agents and prevent them from deleting important files, directly addressing the "YOLO" and "normalization of deviance" theme from the article. This sparked a sub-thread on the trade-offs of different sandboxing methods like devcontainers.
*   **AI Safety and Societal Impact:** A more somber thread addresses the negative consequences of AI, specifically its role in "fatal self-harm." The author, Simon Willison, acknowledges this is a serious problem and notes that while labs are investing in safety measures, the exponential growth in users could outpace these improvements. This led to a debate about whether the culture within AI labs, which some describe as a "religious quest," might hinder genuine progress on safety.
*   **Economic Fears and Future Outlook:** The potential for AI to cause mass unemployment for software engineers was a recurring concern. One commenter predicted that if intellectual labor like coding can be automated, most other knowledge work will follow, though manual labor may persist longer. The author noted he considered including a section on this but struggled to frame it effectively.
*   **Nostalgia and Tooling:** Users contrasted the current pace of progress with the much slower pace of previous years (e.g., "syntactic sugar in Java"). There was also a specific discussion about tools for connecting LLMs to external resources, with users debating the future of MCP versus other approaches like "skills" and OpenAPI specs.

## [Warren Buffett steps down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO after six decades](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-31/warren-buffett-steps-down-as-berkshire-hathaway-ceo-after-six-decades)
**Score:** 683 | **Comments:** 523 | **ID:** 46448705

> **Article:** The linked article from the Los Angeles Times reports the historic news that Warren Buffett will step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway after more than six decades of leadership. The article details his unparalleled tenure, the transition plan to his successors, and the end of an era for one of the world's most iconic investors and companies.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Warren Buffett's retirement is multifaceted, touching on his investment strategy, personal character, and broader economic impact.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the future of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) without its legendary leader. Commenters debate whether Buffett's "value investing" strategy can continue to succeed in a modern market often driven by "vibes" and speculative valuations rather than fundamentals. Some argue that his success was also due to factors like leverage and a unique market environment that no longer exists, while others believe the core principles of investing in solid, undervalued companies will endure.

The conversation also delves into Buffett's personal motivations and work ethic. Many express admiration for his consistency and low-stress demeanor, speculating that his passion for investing is a lifestyle rather than a job. This contrasts with a few commenters who question why anyone would continue working after achieving immense wealth, a sentiment that is countered by others who argue that purpose and enjoyment are powerful drivers.

Finally, the discussion includes a critical perspective on Buffett's legacy. While many celebrate him as a hero and philanthropist, others point to the negative externalities of his investments, such as poor labor conditions at Berkshire-owned companies like BNSF Railway. This leads to a debate about the nature of capitalism and whether financial success can be separated from its social and ethical costs.

## [Bluetooth Headphone Jacking: A Key to Your Phone [video]](https://media.ccc.de/v/39c3-bluetooth-headphone-jacking-a-key-to-your-phone)
**Score:** 358 | **Comments:** 109 | **ID:** 46453204

> **Article:** The linked content is a presentation from the 39th Chaos Communication Congress (39C3) detailing a set of severe security vulnerabilities found in Bluetooth chipsets from the manufacturer Airoha. The exploit chain, dubbed "Bluetooth Headphone Jacking," allows an attacker in physical proximity to gain unauthenticated access to a target's Bluetooth headphones. The attack involves connecting to the device, dumping its firmware to extract the Bluetooth Link Keys of previously paired devices, and then impersonating the headphones to connect to the user's phone. Once connected to the phone, the attacker has privileged access, enabling potential surveillance or other malicious activities. The presentation criticizes Airoha and several major device manufacturers (including Sony, Marshall, and Jabra) for their slow response to the vulnerabilities and poor communication with users about security updates. The researchers also released tooling to help users check for affected devices and to allow for further research and potential firmware patching.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical details of the exploit, the broader implications for Bluetooth security, and the ongoing debate over wired versus wireless audio. Many commenters expressed shock at the severity of the vulnerabilities, with some providing a step-by-step breakdown of how an attacker could steal pairing keys to impersonate a user's headphones. This reignited a long-standing skepticism towards Bluetooth, with one user noting that OpenBSD was often criticized for its refusal to implement Bluetooth support, which now seems like a prescient security decision. The conversation frequently circled back to the removal of the headphone jack from smartphones, a move initiated by Apple under the banner of "courage." Commenters lamented this trend, arguing that it forced consumers into less secure wireless options, and expressed frustration that the industry followed suit, leaving few high-end phones with a traditional audio port. While some defended the convenience of Bluetooth, others highlighted the security risks and the technical "messiness" of the standard. The discussion also included a notable mention that U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris had publicly stated she avoids wireless headphones for security reasons, which users saw as a real-world confirmation of the risks presented in the talk.

## [ACM Is Now Open Access](https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2026/january/acm-open-access)
**Score:** 287 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46454763

> **Article:** The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has announced a transition to a "fully open access" model for its Digital Library. This move makes all articles immediately available to readers for free, eliminating paywalls. However, the model shifts the cost burden to authors or their institutions through Article Processing Charges (APCs), which are cited as being over $1000 per article (though discounted for many). The ACM frames this as a move to provide a large, highly curated, and integrated library to all.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction is largely skeptical, viewing the announcement as a "half-measure" rather than a true victory for open access. The primary point of contention is the shift from a reader-pays to an author-pays model. Commenters argue that charging authors high fees (APCs) simply moves the barrier to publication, potentially disadvantaging researchers from less-funded institutions or countries, despite the existence of waivers.

Several key themes emerged:
*   **The "True Cost" of Publishing:** While many are critical of the APCs, a counter-argument from an ACM volunteer explains that ACM is a non-profit and these fees are necessary to cover the significant operational costs of maintaining a long-term digital archive, managing plagiarism cases, and supporting the volunteer-run peer review process. This is contrasted with for-profit publishers like Elsevier, who are seen as profiteering.
*   **The Definition of "Open":** The term "open access" itself is questioned. One commenter points out that while articles may be free, ACM is simultaneously paywalling metadata, and another notes that the "free" tier for individuals lacks advanced search features.
*   **Alternatives and Context:** Users mention that researchers often publish pre-prints on arXiv anyway, which is free for all. Others point to OpenAlex as a completely free alternative for metadata and discovery. The discussion also highlights that this is a step ahead of IEEE but that the ultimate goal should be open access from all major publishers.
*   **Gatekeeping and Quality:** A tangential but interesting discussion arises about the role of fees in preventing a flood of low-quality or nonsensical submissions, with one user sharing a personal anecdote about the volume of "crank" papers that reviewers must filter.

## [I rebooted my social life](https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/this-might-be-oversharing)
**Score:** 255 | **Comments:** 187 | **ID:** 46453114

> **Article:** The author describes a personal crisis of loneliness and social isolation, which he terms "social bankruptcy." Despite having close friends and online acquaintances, he realized he lacked a genuine local community. He decided to actively "reboot" his social life by intentionally seeking out and joining groups based on his interests, such as a local running club. The article chronicles his journey of moving from passive online interaction to active, in-person community building, framing it as a necessary and rewarding effort to combat the modern trend of social atomization.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates the article's premise, with many users sharing their own experiences of loneliness and the strategies they've used to build community. A central theme is the critical importance of "third spaces" (places outside of home and work) for social well-being. Several commenters offered practical solutions, such as starting new clubs, joining co-working spaces to simulate office camaraderie, or participating in volunteer organizations. There was a notable distinction made between online and in-person communities, with a consensus that while online friends are valuable, they cannot fully replace the benefits of local, face-to-face interaction. The conversation also touched on the challenges of making friends as an adult, the awkwardness of "friend-hunting," and the importance of finding low-stakes, regular activities as a foundation for friendship. A poignant sub-thread focused on the difficulty of helping friends who are trapped in cycles of isolation and depression.

## [Meta made scam ads harder to find instead of removing them](https://sherwood.news/tech/rather-than-fully-cracking-down-on-scam-ads-meta-worked-to-make-them-harder/)
**Score:** 235 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46453582

> **Article:** An article from Sherwood News reports on a Reuters investigation into Meta's handling of scam ads. The core finding is that rather than implementing a comprehensive crackdown, Meta developed a "playbook" to make these ads harder for regulators and journalists to find. The strategy involved identifying the specific search terms and celebrity names used by Japanese regulators to find fraudulent ads. Meta then repeatedly ran these identical searches, deleting only the ads that appeared in those specific results. This approach allowed Meta to claim it was removing fraudulent content while potentially leaving many other scam ads active on its platforms, as long as they weren't surfaced by the specific "test" searches.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the ethics and mechanics of Meta's strategy, with a strong consensus that the company's actions were deceptive. A key point of debate was whether this constituted "cloaking"—a black-hat SEO technique where a site shows different content to search engines than to users. While one commenter argued that Meta was simply targeting the most likely search terms used by regulators, the original poster and others maintained that filtering ad visibility based on the viewer's identity (e.g., a regulator's IP address or profile) is functionally equivalent to cloaking.

Many commenters expressed frustration that this behavior is not unique to Meta, with several pointing to similar issues on Google, particularly with YouTube ads and phishing sites bidding on brand keywords. The discussion also highlighted a perceived conflict of interest for ad platforms, which profit from ad spend regardless of the ad's legitimacy. This led to broader critiques of the company, with some users suggesting that the only solution is to stop using Meta's products, while others questioned why such companies are allowed to operate without significant legal consequences. One commenter drew a parallel to the "Dieselgate" emissions scandal, coining the term "Dieselgate for Meta" to frame the issue as a deliberate circumvention of regulatory oversight.

## [Resistance training load does not determine hypertrophy](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP289684)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 300 | **ID:** 46448998

> **Article:** The linked article is a scientific paper from The Journal of Physiology that investigates the effect of resistance training load (heavy vs. light weights) on muscle hypertrophy (growth). The study had 20 healthy, recreationally active young men train one leg with high loads (low reps) and the other with low loads (high reps) to failure for 10 weeks. The key finding was that both groups experienced nearly identical increases in muscle size. The study concludes that as long as training is taken to the point of muscular failure, the specific load or repetition range does not significantly determine the degree of muscle hypertrophy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the study's implications, with significant skepticism regarding its methodology and applicability.

A primary theme was the interpretation of the findings: many commenters summarized the takeaway as "load doesn't matter for hypertrophy as long as you train to failure." This led to a distinction between goals, with several users pointing out that while muscle size might be similar, training with heavy, low-rep sets is superior for developing strength and power, which is crucial for athletes.

However, the study's validity was heavily scrutinized. The most common criticisms were:
*   **The "Untrained" Problem:** A major point of contention was that the participants were "untrained." Commenters argued that "newbie gains" are so easy to achieve that almost any form of exercise would produce results, making the study's conclusions unreliable for anyone who has been training for more than a few months.
*   **Study Limitations:** Other methodological concerns included the small sample size (20 participants), the short duration (10 weeks), and the lack of blinding, which are common issues in exercise science research.

Practical advice and related topics also emerged. Several users stressed the importance of defining "failure" correctly, warning that pushing too hard, especially for older or less experienced individuals, can lead to serious injury. The discussion also touched upon the "no pain, no gain" adage, with many advising against it, stating that training should cause exhaustion, not sharp pain. Ultimately, a common sentiment was that while the science is debated, the practical advice is simple: consistency and effort are what truly matter for most people.

## [iOS allows alternative browser engines in Japan](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines-jp/)
**Score:** 213 | **Comments:** 131 | **ID:** 46453950

> **Article:** Apple has announced that it will allow third-party browser engines, other than its own WebKit, on iOS in Japan. This change is a response to local regulations aimed at promoting competition. The policy update enables developers to ship browsers using alternative engines like Blink (used by Chrome and Edge) or Gecko (used by Firefox) specifically for users in Japan. This move follows a similar, broader allowance made for the European Union due to the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The article links to Apple's official developer documentation outlining the technical requirements and entitlements needed for these alternative engines.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly skeptical of Apple's move, viewing it as a reluctant compliance with legal pressure rather than a genuine embrace of competition. The consensus is that Apple is deliberately making the process difficult to discourage adoption.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Legal Pressure as the Driver:** Commenters universally agree that this change is a direct result of new competition laws in Japan and the EU, not a voluntary decision by Apple. They express frustration that this isn't being extended to other regions like the US.

*   **Skepticism of Implementation:** Many users believe Apple is complying with the letter of the law while undermining the spirit of it. They point to onerous requirements, such as a separate binary for the browser engine, and the potential for bad APIs and slow bug fixes to create a "hostile environment" for developers. This is seen as a strategy to make alternative engines uncompetitive and maintain Apple's control.

*   **The "Monoculture" Debate:** A recurring point is the concern that forcing competition could ironically lead to a web engine monoculture dominated by Google's Blink, as it already has the largest market share. This raises questions about whether this is truly better for the web's long-term health.

*   **Apple's Justification:** Some commenters acknowledge Apple's stated reasons for using WebKit—security, battery life, and standardization—and question whether the benefits of a single engine are a genuine motivation rather than purely anti-competitive.

*   **Practical Outcomes:** Users question whether major players like Mozilla (Firefox) or Google (Chrome) will actually invest the significant resources required to port and maintain their engines for what is currently a limited market (Japan and the EU), especially given the anticipated difficulties.

## [Scientists unlock brain's natural clean-up system for new treatments for stroke](https://www.monash.edu/pharm/about/news/news-listing/latest/scientists-unlock-brains-natural-clean-up-system-to-develop-new-treatments-for-stroke-and-other-neurological-diseases)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46448894

> **Article:** Researchers at Monash University have identified a specific protein, Sema3A, that regulates the brain's natural waste clearance system. This system, known as the glymphatic system, is responsible for cleaning the brain of metabolic byproducts and toxins. The study found that after a stroke, this system becomes less effective. By manipulating Sema3A levels, scientists were able to restore the brain's cleaning function in animal models. This breakthrough could lead to new treatments for stroke and other neurological diseases like Alzheimer's, where the buildup of toxic proteins is a key factor in the disease's progression.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the practical implications of the research and related health interventions. A central theme was the connection between this new science and the body's lymphatic system. Users pointed to a similar study involving shunts in cervical lymph nodes to treat Alzheimer's, suggesting a common mechanism. This led to a user-shared tip that massaging neck lymph nodes for 10 minutes a day could increase drainage and potentially help prevent neurodegenerative diseases, a suggestion that was met with both interest and skepticism.

Another major thread revolved around the supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Commenters highlighted NAC's "mucous thinning" properties and its wide-ranging efficacy in scientific literature for numerous conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders, COPD, and liver problems. This sparked requests for review articles and further reading.

Finally, the discussion touched on broader topics:
*   **Alternative Medicine:** One user framed the research as a validation of "Oriental medicine" practices, which was countered by another user cautioning against conflating hard science with pseudoscience and noting the significant leap from peripheral massage to affecting the brain's glymphatic system.
*   **Personal Health:** A user wondered if their thyroid cancer surgery, which involved removing lymph nodes, might have impaired their brain's ability to clean itself.
*   **Specific Conditions:** A user asked if this research could lead to treatments for autism symptoms.

**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 14 | **ID:** 46455872

> **Article:** The article "Cameras and Lenses" by Bartosz Ciechanowski is an interactive, visual explainer on the physics of optics. It builds a mental model of how cameras work from the ground up, starting with the nature of light and photons, moving to the concept of a pinhole camera, and finally explaining how lenses bend light to form sharp images. The article uses custom interactive graphics to illustrate complex concepts like aperture, focus, depth of field (specifically the "circle of confusion"), and chromatic aberration, allowing readers to manipulate variables and see the effects in real-time. The goal is to make the underlying principles of photography intuitive and visually clear.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with commenters lauding the article as a masterpiece of educational content. The primary praise is directed at the author's (Bartosz Ciechanowski) ability to use interactive graphics to build a "mental model" that makes complex topics intuitive. Many users express that the interactive explanations, particularly for depth of field, were more effective than any static text they had encountered.

Beyond the specific topic of cameras, the conversation highlights a few key themes:
*   **High Production Value:** Users compare the author's work to other high-quality educational creators like Andrey Karpathy and 3Blue1Brown, marveling at the depth and productivity required to produce such content.
*   **Technical and Educational Nuance:** One commenter offers a minor critique regarding the common visual metaphor for electromagnetic waves, arguing it can be misleading, which sparked a brief, thoughtful discussion on the challenges of science communication.
*   **Value and Support:** There is a strong sentiment that this type of original, high-effort content is valuable and should be supported, with users quickly sharing links to the author's Patreon.
*   **Technical Issues:** A minor point of discussion was a user reporting that the site didn't work in Firefox, though others countered that it functioned correctly for them.

## [The Delete Act](https://privacy.ca.gov/drop/about-drop-and-the-delete-act/)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 78 | **ID:** 46449694

> **Article:** The article, from the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), details the "Delete Act" (SB 362). This landmark legislation builds upon the existing California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) by creating a centralized mechanism for consumers to request the deletion of their personal data from all registered data brokers. A key feature is the creation of a "one-stop-shop" deletion request, managed by a centralized deletion mechanism provider, which will then notify all data brokers. The act also mandates annual reporting from data brokers on their data collection and deletion practices and introduces financial penalties for non-compliance. The service is slated to become operational by August 1, 2026.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely positive, viewing the Delete Act as a significant step forward in consumer privacy that goes further than the GDPR by creating infrastructure for large-scale data deletion. A central theme is the hope that this California-specific law will create a "Brussels Effect," forcing data brokers and tech companies to adopt this standard globally to simplify compliance, rather than managing different rules for different states or regions.

However, several practical concerns and nuances were raised. Users questioned the definition of a "data broker," debating whether companies like Google and Facebook, which collect but don't directly sell data, would be included. There was also significant discussion about the potential unintended consequences of mass data deletion, with one user fearing that a lack of data could lead to failed background checks or credit assessments, similar to how a lack of credit history can be a disadvantage. On a practical note, users noted that the central deletion portal is not yet live (scheduled for 2026) and expressed frustration with existing company-specific deletion processes.

## [Sony PS5 ROM keys leaked – jailbreaking could be made easier with BootROM codes](https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/playstation/playstation-5-rom-keys-leaked-jailbreaking-could-be-made-easier-with-bootrom-codes)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46455053

> **Article:** An article from Tom's Hardware reports on the leak of PlayStation 5 ROM keys. These keys are part of the console's secure boot process, which is built on AMD's Platform Security Processor (PSP). The leak of these keys, which are burned into the APU and cannot be changed, allows hackers to decrypt the console's bootloader. This is a significant development as it enables researchers to study the bootloader's code in-depth to find vulnerabilities. While the article and its sources clarify that this does not immediately enable piracy or a full jailbreak, it dramatically simplifies the first step of the hacking process: understanding and analyzing the system's core security.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion provides significant nuance and technical context to the article, primarily focusing on tempering hype and explaining the technical realities.

There is a strong consensus that the leak is a major step for researchers but not a "one-click" solution for piracy. Commenters clarify that the keys are decryption keys, not signing keys, meaning they allow for analysis of the bootloader but don't immediately allow an attacker to create and sign their own modified firmware. The process of achieving a full jailbreak would still require finding a separate exploit within the now-decrypted code.

The technical method of the leak was also a point of interest. One commenter corrected the assumption of a corporate breach, explaining that these keys must be present on every console for it to boot. The leak likely resulted from a hardware-level compromise, such as using fault injection to trick the processor into revealing its secrets, a method detailed in a related Chaos Communication Congress (CCC) presentation.

Several commenters drew parallels to past console security failures, most notably the PS3's cryptographic mistake. A sub-discussion there corrected the idea that removing the "Other OS" (Linux) feature caused the PS3 hack, clarifying that the feature's existence was the initial vector for the first major jailbreak, and Sony removed it in response.

Finally, a prominent commenter, citing a security researcher, argued that news outlets were overhyping the leak. They stressed that the keys alone are insufficient to "pwn" the PS5 and that significant additional work, such as finding other hardware secrets (fuses, NAND groups) or software bugs in the now-decrypted ROM, is still required for a full compromise.

## [2025 Letter](https://danwang.co/2025-letter/)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 93 | **ID:** 46454413

> **Article:** Dan Wang's "2025 Letter" is an annual review and forecast that contrasts the societal and technological trajectories of the United States and China. The central argument posits that China excels in "building" — demonstrated by its rapid, large-scale infrastructure development and industrial capacity — while the US excels in "inventing" — fostering breakthrough innovation, particularly in software and AI. Wang suggests that the US's advantage in foundational creativity is increasingly offset by its inability to execute major physical projects, a weakness China has turned into a strategic strength. The letter also touches on the cultural landscape of Silicon Valley, the dynamics of a potential US-China "Cold War," and the state of the AI race, framing the competition as one between a nation that can build the future and one that can imagine it.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with many commenters praising the article as a balanced, insightful, and well-written analysis of the US-China dynamic. A significant portion of the conversation focused on the book "Breakneck," which was highly recommended as essential reading for understanding the author's perspective. Several key themes emerged from the comments:

*   **US vs. China Competence:** The article's core thesis — that China builds while the US invents — resonated strongly. One commenter highlighted a particularly memorable line: "Beijing has been preparing for Cold War without eagerness for waging it, while the US wants to wage a Cold War without preparing for it."
*   **Silicon Valley Culture:** The letter's description of Silicon Valley sparked debate. While some agreed with the portrayal of its "blandly corporate" tone, others strongly challenged the idea that it is "meritocratic," arguing that it operates on its own form of credentialism based on past employers and network connections rather than pure ability.
*   **Critique and Fact-Checking:** A few users questioned specific data points, such as the claim that the median age of Y Combinator founders has dropped to 24, and debated the author's characterization of tech leaders' sense of humor.
*   **Broader Strategic Questions:** One commenter used the article as a springboard to question the long-term strategic goals of both superpowers, asking "Then What?" after a potential Cold War and expressing skepticism about whether either nation has a plan for the benefit of humanity.

## [Python numbers every programmer should know](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/python-numbers-every-programmer-should-know/)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 46454470

> **Article:** The article "Python numbers every programmer should know" presents a collection of benchmarks and memory usage figures for Python's fundamental data types and operations. It provides specific numbers for tasks like creating integers and strings, list/dict/set lookups, and function call overhead. The goal is to give programmers a concrete, quantitative sense of the performance characteristics and memory costs of common Python constructs, helping them understand the "order of magnitude" for these operations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the article's premise, arguing that memorizing these specific numbers is of limited practical value. The central theme is that Python is chosen for developer productivity, not raw performance, and when performance becomes critical, the solution is not micro-optimization in Python but rather using a different tool.

Several key points emerge from the comments:
*   **Python is the Wrong Tool for Optimization:** Many commenters argue that if an application's performance depends on knowing these micro-level numbers, Python is not the right language for that task. The correct approach is to either use a faster language (like C or Rust) from the start or to offload performance-critical code to compiled extensions, as libraries like NumPy and PyTorch do.
*   **Focus on Algorithms, Not Constants:** A recurring point is that understanding high-level time and space complexity (e.g., O(n) vs. O(log n)) is far more important for writing efficient software than memorizing the constant-time costs of specific operations in one language.
*   **Context and Variability:** Commenters point out that these numbers are not universal; they depend on hardware, Python version, and build configuration, making them unreliable as hard facts to memorize.
*   **Pragmatism over Premature Optimization:** The consensus is that developers should focus on writing clear, correct code first. If performance issues arise, they should be identified with profiling tools in a real-world context, rather than trying to preemptively optimize based on a chart of abstract benchmarks.
*   **Misleading Claims:** Some users found specific claims in the article to be imprecise, such as conflating membership testing with iteration or oversimplifying the cost of string concatenation.

In essence, the community's reaction is that while the numbers are "interesting," they are not something "every programmer should know." The discussion advocates for a higher-level, more pragmatic approach to performance, emphasizing good algorithms, proper tooling, and leveraging compiled libraries where necessary.

## [Children and Helical Time](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2025/12/30/children-and-helical-time/)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46452763

> **Article:** The article "Children and Helical Time" proposes that our subjective perception of time changes over our lifespan. It uses a logarithmic graph to illustrate this: for a child, a single year represents a huge fraction of their life (e.g., 1/5 for a 5-year-old), making time feel expansive and slow. As we age, a year becomes an ever-smaller fraction of our total life (1/40, 1/70), making it feel like it passes more quickly. The author argues that this "compression" of time in adulthood is why childhood memories feel so vibrant and intense. To counteract this feeling of acceleration, the author suggests two "heli-cal" (spiral-like) approaches: experiencing "vicarious firsts" through the wonder of one's children, and finding an "urgency that won't let you drift" by taking on significant responsibilities that force you to be present and engaged.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a deep divide on whether the article's premise resonates with personal experience. A significant portion of commenters reject the logarithmic theory, arguing that their most vibrant and "longest" memories occurred in adulthood, such as during university, marriage, or raising a family. They contend that novelty, curiosity, and a lack of routine—not age—are the true drivers of time perception, and that a boring or repetitive life is what makes time feel like it's flying, not simply getting older.

A key theme is the role of lifestyle and agency. Many suggest that the feeling of time accelerating is a product of a monotonous, obligation-heavy adult life (e.g., a boring office job), rather than an inevitable consequence of aging. Commenters who have maintained curiosity, pursued creative passions, or built a life with autonomy report that their experience remains vivid. The idea of vicarious wonder through children is also met with skepticism by some who find their own adult experiences, like parenthood, to be more intense than their childhood.

Finally, the discussion touches on the nature of memory itself. One commenter points out that childhood often feels vibrant in retrospect because it was shielded from adult worries, a perspective that reframes the nostalgia. The conversation ultimately explores whether time perception is a universal psychological phenomenon or a subjective experience heavily influenced by one's choices, environment, and personal sense of fulfillment.

## [Show HN: BusterMQ, Thread-per-core NATS server in Zig with io_uring](https://bustermq.sh/)
**Score:** 128 | **Comments:** 60 | **ID:** 46449812

> **Project:** BusterMQ is a high-performance, open-source NATS server implementation written in the Zig programming language. It is architecturally designed for maximum throughput using a "thread-per-core" model and leverages Linux's `io_uring` for asynchronous I/O. The project is built using the Bazel build system and is presented via a modern, polished landing page.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion was polarized, focusing heavily on the project's authenticity and modern development practices rather than its technical merits. A central point of contention was the suspicion that the project was "AI slop" or "vibe-coded," fueled by its polished landing page, the use of Bazel (which is atypical for Zig projects that have their own build system), and a single large commit. The author clarified that while AI was used as a tool, the project was the result of significant personal iteration and expertise.

Technical points of interest included its performance architecture (thread-per-core, io_uring), its deliberate lack of durability features (matching standard NATS, not Jetstream), and the choice of Zig for performance and personal preference. The use of Bazel sparked a separate debate, with some praising its value for monorepos while others questioned its necessity over Zig's native build tools.

## [Rust--: Rust without the borrow checker](https://github.com/buyukakyuz/rustmm)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46453062

> **Article:** The project "Rust--" (rustmm) is a Rust library that enables writing Rust code without the borrow checker. It provides an alternative standard library and memory management system based on manual memory management techniques like ring buffers and arenas, explicitly avoiding dynamic allocation. The README includes a note for LLMs and an unconventional "NSFW" license. The project is positioned as a way to gain Rust's syntax and tooling while opting out of its strict memory safety guarantees.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted to the project with a mix of skepticism, humor, and philosophical debate. The prevailing sentiment is that the project is largely pointless or counterproductive. Many commenters dismissed it as "C++ with extra steps" or "C with ring buffers," arguing that if one is willing to accept manual memory management, there are more mature languages to use than a modified Rust.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on the practical consequences of removing the borrow checker. Users noted that this would not only eliminate memory safety but also disable key compiler optimizations that rely on the borrow checker's strict aliasing rules (like the `restrict` keyword). There was also speculation that compile times would not improve significantly because the project likely still performs error checks, just in a way that suppresses them rather than enforcing them.

Several comments analyzed the developer's mindset, suggesting that fighting a language's core features is an inefficient use of time. A notable counterpoint was raised regarding the "opposite" concept: using the borrow checker as a standalone tool to help build alternative Rust compilers for exotic hardware. However, other users rebutted this, pointing out that the borrow checker is written in Rust and would be trivial to include in such a compiler anyway, making a standalone version unnecessary.

## [Worlds largest electric ship launched by Tasmanian boatbuilder](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/02/hull-096-worlds-largest-electric-ship-battery-power-launched)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46452937

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports on the launch of the "China Zorrilla," the world's largest electric ship, built by the Tasmanian company Incat. The vessel is a 130-meter roll-on/roll-off ferry designed to carry 2,200 passengers and 450 vehicles across the River Plate between Argentina and Uruguay. It is powered by a massive 250-tonne, 40-megawatt-hour battery pack, which requires approximately 50 hours to fully charge. The ship is constructed from aluminum for weight savings and uses water jet propulsion instead of propellers, making it suitable for the shallow waters of its route.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the technical specifications, cost, and practicality of the new electric ferry. A key point of interest is the ship's weight, with users comparing the 250-tonne battery pack to the ~700 tonnes of engines and fuel in a conventional vessel, noting the significant weight savings of the electric design.

Several users expressed skepticism about the charging time. One commenter calculated that a 50-hour charge is impractical for a short ferry crossing, estimating it would realistically take 5-10 days. However, another user pointed out that the ship is designed for rapid turnaround and likely uses powerful, specialized shore charging infrastructure not accounted for in that calculation.

The conversation also covered the ship's cost and construction. Users noted the $200 million price tag is surprisingly competitive for a one-off, large, custom-built vessel, especially when compared to the costs of electrification projects in the US. The ship's aluminum hull and water jet propulsion were highlighted as key design features for efficiency and its specific operational environment.

Finally, there was a debate about adding solar panels to the ship's flat roof. While some commenters suggested it would be a good idea, others argued that the energy generated would be negligible compared to the ship's massive power requirements, making it more efficient to charge from a dedicated land-based power source.
