## [Microsoft forced me to switch to Linux](https://www.himthe.dev/blog/microsoft-to-linux)
**Score:** 1640 | **Comments:** 1297 | **ID:** 46795864

> **Article:** The article "Microsoft forced me to switch to Linux" is a personal blog post detailing the author's journey away from Windows. The catalyst was the end-of-life announcement for Windows 10 combined with their hardware being incompatible with Windows 11 due to Microsoft's strict CPU requirements. The author frames this as a "forced" decision rather than a choice.

The post details the initial friction of switching (learning the command line, choosing a distribution) but ultimately concludes that the switch was a positive experience. It highlights the benefits of a free, open-source OS, the ability to continue using perfectly functional hardware, and the high quality of Linux gaming support thanks to Steam and Proton. The article serves as a testament to the viability of Linux as a desktop OS for a former Windows user.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely mirrors the article's themes, with users sharing their own reasons for switching to or sticking with Linux. The conversation can be broken down into several key areas:

**Primary Motivations for Switching:**
*   **Hardware Incompatibility:** This was the most cited reason, echoing the author. Users expressed frustration that Microsoft's arbitrary CPU requirements for Windows 11 forced them to discard functional hardware, making Linux a logical alternative.
*   **Windows 11 Performance and UI:** A significant point of contention was the perceived decline in Windows performance. One user reported a sluggish file explorer and slow context menus even on a high-end work laptop, while others countered that this was likely due to corporate bloatware, not the OS itself. The general sentiment was that Windows has become slower and less efficient over time.
*   **Microsoft's Aggressive Tactics:** Users criticized Microsoft's push for online accounts, bundled advertising, and the general direction of the OS, contrasting it with the freedom and control offered by Linux.

**The State of Linux Gaming:**
*   **Proton is a Game-Changer:** There was widespread agreement that Steam and Proton have made Linux a formidable gaming platform. Many users declared they can play the vast majority of their library without issue.
*   **The Anti-Cheat Problem:** The main exception is multiplayer games that use invasive, kernel-level anti-cheat software, which is a major blocker for some players.
*   **A Principled Stand:** Several users advocated for a "vote with your wallet" approach, refusing to buy games that don't support Linux, thereby encouraging developers to change.

**Counterpoints and Nuances:**
*   **The Apple Comparison:** Some users pointed out that Apple is just as aggressive with hardware obsolescence, yet often receives less criticism. Others argued that while macOS has its flaws, Apple's hardware (especially the M-series chips) is currently superior to what's available for Linux on laptops.
*   **Linux's Remaining Friction:** A long-time Linux user acknowledged persistent issues, such as inconsistent UI frameworks (GTK vs. Qt, X vs. Wayland), poor support for non-standard DPI displays, and the complexity of configuring audio and webcams.
*   **Corporate vs. Personal Experience:** A recurring theme was the distinction between a clean, personal install of Windows or Linux versus a locked-down, slow corporate machine, with many performance complaints attributed to the latter.

## [Amazon cuts 16k jobs](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/)
**Score:** 572 | **Comments:** 801 | **ID:** 46796745

> **Article:** The article reports that Amazon is cutting 16,000 jobs globally as part of a broader corporate restructuring. The layoffs primarily affect technical roles and middle management, with the company citing a need for efficiency and the integration of AI as key drivers for the workforce reduction.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding Amazon's layoffs is multifaceted, with users exploring several key themes beyond the official company narrative.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the causes of the layoffs. While Amazon attributes the cuts to AI-driven efficiency, many commenters are skeptical, viewing "AI" as a convenient buzzword to mask what they believe are more traditional business motivations. The primary alternative theory is that these are a long-overdue correction following the massive over-hiring during the Zero Interest-Rate Policy (ZIRP) era, with one user noting that companies are now shedding "ZIRP-era deadweight."

The conversation also explores the human and societal impact of this technological shift. A compelling anecdote from a user who spoke with an Amazon middle manager serves as a focal point. The manager had built an AI tool to automate his own role, believing he would be retained to maintain it, a story that sparked a broader discussion on the inevitability of progress. While some argued that technological displacement is a historical constant (citing horse-shoe makers and telephone operators), others countered that the replacement of cognitive labor with AI is fundamentally different, as there is no clear "next step" for displaced knowledge workers.

Finally, the discussion touches on the role of global labor markets and visa programs. Some users connected the layoffs to a reduction in H1-B visas, while others, including those with experience at Amazon, clarified that job cuts are happening globally, not just in the U.S., and that hiring in regions like India is a long-term trend rather than a direct replacement strategy. A separate, heated debate emerged about whether a sufficient pool of qualified American STEM workers exists, with some arguing that U.S. companies rely on foreign talent to fill high-skill roles.

## [Please don't say mean things about the AI I just invested a billion dollars in](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/please-dont-say-mean-things-about-the-ai-that-i-just-invested-a-billion-dollars-in)
**Score:** 503 | **Comments:** 228 | **ID:** 46803356

> **Article:** The article is a satirical piece from McSweeney's written from the perspective of a defensive billionaire investor. The narrator complains about "hurtful narratives" surrounding their recent billion-dollar investment in AI. They sarcastically list the perceived harms of the technology, acknowledging that it is excellent for scamming the elderly, creating distrust in online content, and generating misinformation, while dismissing these concerns as merely the cost of "revolutionary" innovation. The piece mocks the detached optimism of tech investors who prioritize disruption over societal stability.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's satirical premise, with users expressing significant skepticism and criticism regarding the current state and deployment of AI. The debate centers on three main themes:

**1. AI's Role in Malicious Activities**
A primary point of contention is whether AI is inherently harmful or merely a tool. Several users argued that AI supercharges scams, particularly voice-cloning fraud targeting the elderly and businesses. While some defenders used the "guns don't kill people" analogy, others countered that the technology's primary function in current use cases often involves deception, astroturfing, and generating "hallucinations" that erode trust.

**2. Economic Impact and Labor Displacement**
There is widespread anxiety regarding AI's impact on jobs. Users shared anecdotes of managers seeking to replace engineers with AI, though technical respondents pushed back on the feasibility of this. The discussion also touched on the economic viability of the AI industry, with some noting that while big tech companies are losing billions, hardware suppliers like NVIDIA are profiting. A key debate emerged between those who view AI as a democratizing force and those who fear it concentrates power and wealth among "robber barons" without fair compensation for the data (art, writing, code) used to train models.

**3. Ethics and Data Provenance**
The ethics of training data were heavily scrutinized. Critics argued that current models are built on "stolen" intellectual property from artists, writers, and open-source contributors, making the resulting technology morally compromised. A counter-perspective emerged from users who identify as creators (musicians, open-source contributors) and expressed excitement about AI's potential to augment their work, drawing parallels to historical technological shifts like automation in manufacturing. However, this optimism was tempered by concerns that AI development is centralizing power rather than distributing it.

## [ICE and Palantir: US agents using health data to hunt illegal immigrants](https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s168)
**Score:** 428 | **Comments:** 253 | **ID:** 46794365

> **Article:** The article from The BMJ reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using health data to identify and track undocumented immigrants. The report details how ICE accessed data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including sensitive medical information, to locate individuals for deportation proceedings. This practice involves data from Medicare and Medicaid records, which are typically protected by privacy laws, raising significant legal and ethical concerns about the use of health information for law enforcement and immigration enforcement purposes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the broader implications of privatized surveillance and the erosion of privacy rights. A dominant theme was the fear that private companies like Palantir, driven by profit motives, are more dangerous than government surveillance because they innovate new ways to collect and monetize data, which they then sell to governments. Users expressed a sense of vindication, noting that predictions from the early 2000s about mass surveillance have come to fruition, often exceeding even the most paranoid expectations.

A second major theme was the perceived failure of public resistance. Commenters argued that society has traded privacy for convenience and comfort, citing the popularity of platforms like TikTok and YouTube as evidence that people will consent to a "panopticon" for entertainment and ease. This led to a discussion about a "devil's bargain" where authoritarian control is accepted in exchange for a comfortable lifestyle, with the warning that dissent could quickly turn this into a more oppressive reality.

The conversation also branched into political hypocrisy and the rule of law. Several users criticized "small government" conservatives for supporting such expansive surveillance and enforcement actions, viewing it as a betrayal of their stated principles. There was a consensus among many commenters that the rule of law is no longer being enforced against the federal government, citing examples like the handling of the January 6th events and the TikTok ban. The discussion also included a debate on immigration policy itself, with some users questioning why legal pathways aren't expanded if there is a clear demand for immigrant labor, while others highlighted the deep political division on the issue. Finally, the technical efficiency of Palantir was questioned, with some suggesting it bypasses bureaucratic hurdles to merge data silos, a capability that enables these surveillance practices.

## [Somebody used spoofed ADSB signals to raster the meme of JD Vance](https://alecmuffett.com/article/143548)
**Score:** 418 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46802067

> **Article:** An article on Alec Muffett's blog reports that someone created a large-scale raster image of the political figure JD Vance using aircraft flight data. The image was formed by plotting a "flight path" on public flight-tracking websites, specifically ADS-B Exchange. The "aircraft" used was a fake Boeing 747 designated "VANCE 1," which was assigned an impossible flight profile (e.g., 50,000 ft altitude at 80 knots ground speed). The article highlights that this was not a real flight but a data spoofing prank.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on clarifying the technical method and assessing the legal implications of the prank. The consensus is that the "spoofing" was not done by broadcasting fake radio signals (RF), which would be a serious federal crime, but rather by uploading falsified data directly to the ADS-B Exchange aggregator over the internet. This method is considered less severe as it doesn't interfere with actual air traffic control systems, though it does manipulate public-facing data services that some pilots and enthusiasts use.

Commenters debated the legality. While some suggested it could violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), others argued that without actual radio transmission, it likely falls into a gray area, potentially being a violation of the aggregator's terms of service rather than a major federal offense. The discussion also delved into the technical vulnerabilities of the ADS-B system, which is unencrypted and unauthenticated, making it susceptible to data injection. Several users contributed technical context, noting other historical instances of accidental or intentional spoofing, such as a known bug in the FAA's TIS-B system that created false targets, and a past incident involving the Secret Service broadcasting interfering signals.

## [Airfoil (2024)](https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/)
**Score:** 387 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46795908

> **Article:** The article is an interactive explainer on the physics of airfoils and how they generate lift. It uses highly detailed, interactive diagrams to walk the reader through concepts like pressure differentials, velocity fields, and the role of angle of attack. The piece aims to demystify the mechanics of flight, showing how air pressure differences around a wing create the upward force that keeps planes aloft.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community largely praised the article as a masterclass in interactive technical explanation, with many users citing the author's (Bartosz Ciechanowski) previous work as equally exceptional. The discussion branched into three main technical and philosophical debates:

**1. The Necessity of Airfoils vs. Flat Wings**
A significant thread debated the actual importance of an airfoil's curved shape. One user argued that a flat plate can generate ample lift and that airfoil design is primarily about optimizing the lift-to-drag ratio rather than generating lift itself. Others countered that while flat plates generate lift at an angle of attack, the specific shape of an airfoil is crucial for efficiency and performance, particularly at zero degrees. The consensus leaned toward the airfoil being a highly optimized design rather than the sole "magic" ingredient that makes flight possible.

**2. The Mechanics of Lift**
There was a disagreement regarding the explanation of lift generation. While the article focuses on pressure differentials, a commenter argued this is a misunderstanding, asserting that lift is generated by the wing deflecting airflow downward (momentum change). Another user added nuance, noting that every airfoil has an equilibrium angle of attack where it generates zero lift, suggesting that starting explanations with flat plates might offer clearer intuition.

**3. AI’s Ability to Create Educational Content**
A sub-thread emerged regarding a comment about AI soon being able to create explainers of this caliber.
*   **Skeptics** argued that current AI can only imitate such content "badly," lacking the subtle teaching nuances, visual creativity, and deep expertise of a human creator like Ciechanowski.
*   **Optimists** countered that tools like Claude Code are already capable of producing similar visualizations, though they require significant human oversight to ensure accuracy and avoid subtle errors.

Finally, several users requested resources for similar high-quality interactive educational content, with recommendations including the author's archive, Distill.pub, and ncase.me.

## [ASML staffing changes could result in a net reduction of around 1700 positions](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation)
**Score:** 330 | **Comments:** 334 | **ID:** 46792370

> **Article:** ASML, a critical manufacturer of semiconductor lithography equipment, announced a major restructuring plan that could result in a net reduction of around 1,700 positions. The plan aims to "strengthen focus on engineering and innovation" by eliminating 3,000 management and support roles while creating 1,400 new engineering positions. The company also announced a €12 billion share buyback program to be executed by the end of 2028.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: the dangers of management bloat, the implications of share buybacks, and the cultural context of the changes.

Commenters widely praised ASML's move as a bold and necessary step to combat organizational inefficiency. Many shared personal anecdotes of companies becoming "top-heavy" and stagnant after being acquired by or merging with larger, management-heavy corporations like Philips or Siemens. This was described as a common European corporate malady where managers outnumber executors, creating layers of bureaucracy and meetings that stifle innovation. The consensus was that ASML, having grown into a near-monopolist, was proactively fighting this trend to preserve its engineering-driven culture.

The announcement of a €12 billion share buyback program, however, sparked a significant debate. Some viewed it with dread, associating buybacks with the "financialization" of a company and its eventual decline into a "hollow shell." Others countered that buybacks are a standard and efficient mechanism for distributing profits to shareholders, equivalent to dividends but with tax advantages. The discussion highlighted that major tech companies like Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft have successfully used large-scale buybacks while remaining innovative, suggesting the practice isn't inherently negative.

Finally, there was some discussion about the modern role of engineers versus managers, with several users lamenting that the career path often forces talented engineers into management roles where they may be less effective. The move to reduce management was seen by some as a way to restore a more direct engineering-focused culture.

## [Show HN: The HN Arcade](https://andrewgy8.github.io/hnarcade/)
**Score:** 309 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46793693

> **Project:** The project is "The HN Arcade," a curated directory of games that have been shared on Hacker News. The site aggregates these games into a browsable list, aiming to solve the problem of discovering notable HN game submissions that might otherwise get lost over time. The creator built it to highlight the variety of games posted to the platform, from word puzzles to multiplayer experiences.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was generally positive, with users appreciating the concept of a centralized hub for HN games. However, several points of feedback and related discussions emerged:

*   **UI and Visuals:** A recurring suggestion was to improve the visual presentation. Users requested thumbnails or GIFs for the game cards to help with quick discovery and suggested sorting options (random or by popularity/upvotes) to improve browsing and surface hidden gems.
*   **Data Integrity:** One user questioned the accuracy of the data, specifically pointing out a broken link for a "Lichess" entry and wondering if an LLM generated the content. Another user clarified that the issue likely stemmed from the project's scraping script rather than AI generation.
*   **Community Governance:** A significant discussion point was the long-term maintenance of curated lists. One commenter suggested moving the project to a community organization to ensure its survival if the original creator becomes inactive, citing the common lifecycle of "Awesome" lists.
*   **Project Showcase:** The thread also served as a showcase for other game-related projects. Users shared their own creations, including a no-code game engine, a web-based party game platform, and a lockstep networking arcade, leading to cross-discussion and feedback on those projects as well.
*   **Specific Game Feedback:** For individual games listed (or mentioned in the thread), feedback included UI/contrast complaints for a word game and a wish for the removal of fake high scores in another popular HN game, "enclose.horse."

## [UK Government’s ‘AI Skills Hub’ was delivered by PwC for £4.1M](https://mahadk.com/posts/ai-skills-hub)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46803119

> **Article:** The article reports that the UK Government's "AI Skills Hub" website, intended to help upskill workers for the AI revolution, was delivered by the consulting giant PwC at a cost of £4.1 million. The author, Mahad Khan, presents this as an example of significant government spending on what appears to be a relatively simple digital product, questioning the value for money and the process by which PwC was selected.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the £4.1 million price tag, with commenters exploring several key themes.

A primary focus is on the nature of government procurement. One commenter (marcus_holmes) defends the process, arguing that large organizations, including government, have stringent requirements (like ISO certifications) that small firms cannot meet. They suggest these standards are necessary to mitigate risk, as civil servants are penalized for failures but not for saying "no," leading them to choose large, established firms like PwC. This view was sharply contested, with others arguing this mindset is precisely the problem. Commenters pointed out the absurdity of this risk-aversion, noting that PwC itself is frequently embroiled in scandals, and that this process fails to deliver effective solutions.

The discussion then pivoted to the selection of PwC itself. Several users speculated that the Request for Proposal (RFP) process was either rigged or skewed towards large incumbents. It was suggested that PwC likely wrote the specification to perfectly match their own capabilities, delivering a product that meets the contractual letter but fails to solve the underlying problem. A cynical but recurring point was that this failure is a feature, not a bug, as it guarantees follow-up contracts for the same firm. The political dimension was also heavily scrutinized, with commenters drawing parallels to past "cash-for-honours" scandals and highlighting recent reports of the Labour party receiving significant free staff from PwC and EY, implying a potential conflict of interest.

Finally, the discussion broadened to question the project's fundamental value. Commenters were skeptical of the government's claim that the hub would "upskill 10 million people," dismissing it as a wildly optimistic "if." The project was frequently compared to other notorious examples of government waste, such as the UK's £29 billion Test and Trace system, reinforcing a narrative of systemic incompetence and misuse of taxpayer money in public sector technology contracts. Alternative solutions were proposed, such as commissioning multiple smaller firms to foster competition and reduce costs, though this was acknowledged as a complex challenge in itself.

## [Rust at Scale: An Added Layer of Security for WhatsApp](https://engineering.fb.com/2026/01/27/security/rust-at-scale-security-whatsapp/)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 123 | **ID:** 46791742

> **Article:** Meta's engineering blog details the successful migration of WhatsApp's messaging layer from C++ to Rust. The post highlights that WhatsApp, serving over 3 billion users, required a safer, more performant language to handle its massive scale. The team implemented a "side-by-side" deployment strategy, running both C++ and Rust implementations concurrently. They utilized differential fuzzing to ensure functional equivalence between the two versions before fully cutting over to the Rust implementation. The article notes challenges such as increased binary size due to the Rust standard library (initially ~160KB, later reduced to ~90KB via build optimizations) and the complexity of integrating Rust into an existing C++ build system. Ultimately, the rewrite resulted in a significant reduction of lines of code (LOC) and provided an added layer of security against memory safety vulnerabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three primary themes: the scale of WhatsApp's user base, skepticism regarding Meta's privacy claims, and the technical specifics of the Rust migration.

**Scale and Market Dominance**
Several commenters emphasized WhatsApp's massive global footprint (3 billion daily active users), noting that it is ubiquitous outside of the US. This ubiquity sparked a debate about the "network effect" and the difficulty of deplatforming Meta's services. While some users expressed a principled refusal to use WhatsApp, others highlighted that it is often the only viable communication tool for businesses and personal contacts, making it difficult to avoid.

**Privacy and Trust**
A significant portion of the discussion scrutinized WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption (E2EE). While the article focused on security via memory safety, users questioned the trustworthiness of Meta. Commenters debated whether E2EE is meaningful if the client-side application (owned by Meta) can access message content or if metadata is harvested. There was skepticism about whether Meta complies with government data requests, with users distinguishing between the mathematical implementation of E2EE and the corporate policies of Meta.

**Technical Implementation**
On the engineering front, users analyzed the logistics of the Rust rollout. The "side-by-side" deployment strategy and differential fuzzing were praised as a realistic approach to rewriting critical infrastructure at scale, avoiding the "rewrite and pray" pitfall. Technical discussions focused on the trade-offs of binary size increases caused by the Rust standard library. Users speculated on how Meta optimized the build (likely using Buck2 and linker optimizations) and debated the inefficiencies of using heavy software stacks (like Android tablets) in hardware devices, drawing parallels to the WhatsApp mobile client constraints.

## [That's not how email works](https://danq.me/2026/01/28/hsbc-dont-understand-email/)
**Score:** 239 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46799304

> **Article:** The article "That's not how email works" by Dan Q details his experience with HSBC's poor implementation of email tracking. He received an email from HSBC containing a tracking pixel to monitor if he opened it. The pixel was loaded via an insecure `http://` link, which his email client blocked.

The author highlights several key failures:
1.  **Technical Incompetence:** Using `http://` in 2026 is a security and privacy failure. The tracking mechanism itself is fragile and easily blocked by modern email clients.
2.  **Privacy Invasion:** The tracking pixel includes a unique ID, allowing HSBC to track not just that an email was opened, but precisely when and from where.
3.  **Misuse of Metrics:** The article argues that email open rates are an unreliable metric for individual behavior. Factors like image pre-fetching by services like Gmail create false positives, while privacy-conscious users block tracking entirely, creating false negatives.

The author concludes that HSBC's attempt at surveillance is both technically flawed and conceptually misguided, serving only to undermine customer trust.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's technical points but expands the debate into the nature of corporate bureaucracy, the value of customer data, and the cultural signaling of large institutions.

Several key themes emerged:

*   **Corporate Bureaucracy and Incompetence:** Many commenters expressed disbelief that a major bank would make such basic errors. The consensus was that this was likely the result of a long, bureaucratic process where no one with technical expertise had the authority to challenge flawed decisions from middle management. The use of `http://` was seen as a glaring red flag that any competent security review should have caught.

*   **The Psychology of Bad Metrics:** A former FAANG employee explained that the persistence of email open tracking is driven by human psychology, not technical reality. Marketers and leadership prefer inflated open-rate metrics because they create a perception of success, whereas more accurate metrics like click-through rates would reveal poor performance. Open tracking persists because it "makes people feel good."

*   **The Economics of Customer Action:** A sub-thread debated whether cancelling a bank account is an effective form of protest. While one user claimed banks don't make money on individual accounts, others corrected this, explaining that retail deposits are crucial for a bank's ability to lend money and sell more profitable products (like loans and credit cards). A more effective strategy was suggested: reporting the bank to financial regulators, as this carries a much higher cost for the institution.

*   **Nuance on Privacy and Security:** While the `http://` link was widely condemned, a few commenters debated the actual risk in this specific context. One argued that since the URL still contained the HSBC domain and an anonymized token, the privacy leak was minimal. However, others countered that fetching any unsecured content over public Wi-Fi is a potential attack vector and that the tracking ID could be correlated with other data to de-anonymize the user.

*   **Cultural and Political Signaling:** The author's opening phrase, "virtue-signalling multiculturalism," sparked a side-debate about corporate messaging. Some readers dismissed it as unnecessary political signaling, while others interpreted it as a valid critique of "pink capitalism"—where companies adopt progressive aesthetics without meaningful action. This led to a meta-discussion about the author's own potential signaling and the tendency of online discourse to focus on such phrasing over the core technical argument.

## [Make.ts](https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/27/make-ts.html)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46792194

> **Article:** The article "Make.ts" argues that developers should use a general-purpose programming language (like TypeScript, via a `make.ts` file) instead of shell scripts for task automation. The author, Alex Kladov, contends that while shell is fine for interactive use, it quickly becomes a "terrible scripting language" once logic like conditionals or string manipulation is introduced. The core proposal is to write a simple script in a more robust language to capture and persist ad-hoc commands, making them reusable and shareable. The article provides a TypeScript example using a tagged template literal function (`$`) to execute shell commands, aiming to combine the power of a real programming language with the convenience of shell execution.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a broad consensus that shell scripting is problematic for anything beyond the simplest commands, but diverges on the best replacement. The conversation is split between recommending the author's approach, advocating for existing dedicated tools, and suggesting Python as a simpler alternative.

A significant portion of the comments focuses on existing, purpose-built tools for this task. Several users champion `just` as a mature and powerful alternative to `make`, while others point to modern task runners like `mise` (which also handles runtime versioning) or their own projects like `Rad`, which aim to provide a dedicated, user-friendly scripting language.

The choice of language is another key theme. While the article uses TypeScript, many argue for Python due to its near-universal availability. However, this is countered by the difficulty of managing dependencies in ad-hoc Python scripts, a problem that tools like `uv` are now solving by allowing dependency declarations directly within script files. Deno is also mentioned as a strong candidate for this use case, offering seamless TypeScript execution and import handling.

Finally, the discussion touches on broader workflow habits. Several users extend the article's premise to other areas, arguing against GUI tools like Postman in favor of scriptable command-line tools like `curl` or `httpie`. A notable meta-comment praises the article's hand-written, opinionated style as a refreshing change from AI-generated content, highlighting the value of authentic human voice in technical writing.

## [Apple to soon take up to 30% cut from all Patreon creators in iOS app](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/patreon-apple-tax/)
**Score:** 204 | **Comments:** 180 | **ID:** 46801419

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple will soon enforce its 30% commission on in-app purchases for Patreon creators using the iOS app. This policy change means creators on the platform will lose a significant portion of their revenue to Apple, as Patreon itself typically takes a 5-12% fee. The move is framed as an expansion of Apple's existing App Store rules into the creator economy, forcing Patreon to comply or risk removal from the App Store.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of Apple's decision, with commenters expressing frustration over the 30% "tax" and its application to platforms like Patreon. Several key themes emerged:

**Historical Context and Greed:** Users noted that the 30% fee originated from physical software distribution margins (15% distributor + 15% retailer) and was reasonable in the early App Store days. However, many argue this fee is now excessive for digital subscriptions and services, viewing it as corporate greed rather than a fair exchange for platform services.

**Regulation and Antitrust:** A significant portion of the debate centered on government intervention. While some users advocated for electing officials to regulate Apple's practices, others warned against giving the government too much power, fearing it could be misused. However, many commenters pointed out that antitrust regulation is necessary to combat market failures and that Apple's own anti-competitive behaviors (such as restricting browser engines and forcing native apps) invite legal scrutiny.

**The Duopoly and Alternatives:** The discussion highlighted the lack of viable alternatives, describing the mobile market as a duopoly between Apple and Google. While some suggested switching to Android, others dismissed this as merely trading one "exploiter" for another. A few niche alternatives like Sailfish OS or Linux phones were mentioned, though users acknowledged they are not yet practical for the average consumer.

**Apple's Ecosystem Control:** Commenters criticized Apple's inconsistent application of fees (e.g., "sweetheart deals" for Amazon) and its strategy of crippling web capabilities to force developers into native apps where they can be monetized. There was also a broader critique of Apple's leadership under Tim Cook, with some users arguing that while hardware quality remained high, software quality and developer relations have deteriorated significantly.

## [Oban, the job processing framework from Elixir, has come to Python](https://www.dimamik.com/posts/oban_py/)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46797594

> **Article:** The article announces the release of Oban for Python, a port of the popular job processing framework from the Elixir ecosystem. Oban's core value proposition is its reliance on a relational database (specifically PostgreSQL) as its queue backend, rather than an external system like Redis. This approach allows for transactional job enqueuing: jobs can be inserted within a database transaction, ensuring they are only queued if the main transaction succeeds. The article positions this as a lightweight, durable alternative to more complex systems like Temporal and existing Python tools like Celery.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive but reveals a significant debate around the core architecture and business model.

A central theme is the **"Database vs. Redis" debate** for job queuing. Proponents highlight the critical advantage of transactional integrity, where a job is only queued if the user creation (or other DB operation) is successful. This is praised as a "super power" for building durable systems, especially for long-running AI processes. However, skeptics argue that traditional databases are a poor fit for high-throughput job systems, citing concerns that transactional overhead can become a bottleneck. In response, defenders of the DB approach point out that Oban is specifically optimized for PostgreSQL and has demonstrated the ability to handle immense throughput (millions of jobs per minute).

Another key point is the **business model and feature gating**. The developer of Sidekiq (a spiritual predecessor) congratulated the team, sparking a conversation about the OSS/Pro model. The Pro version includes features like multi-process execution and workflows, which some commenters feel should be part of the free tier to be competitive in the feature-rich Python ecosystem. The developers defend this by stating that a support-only model isn't viable for them and that they may move features to the OSS version over time.

Finally, users discussed **Oban's place in the Python ecosystem**. Many expressed frustration with Celery's complexity and were looking for a simpler, more modern tool. Oban is seen as a strong contender, though it's compared to Temporal, with the consensus being that Temporal offers stronger guarantees at the cost of higher complexity, making Oban a good fit for applications that don't require that level of rigor.

## [Mousefood – Build embedded terminal UIs for microcontrollers](https://github.com/ratatui/mousefood)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 42 | **ID:** 46798402

> **Article:** The article links to "Mousefood," a Rust crate that provides an `embedded-graphics` backend for the popular `Ratatui` library. This allows developers to build terminal user interfaces (TUIs) on resource-constrained microcontrollers (such as ESP32, RP2040, and STM32) without requiring a full operating system. The project enables the creation of rich, text-based UIs on small displays (e.g., OLEDs, e-ink) using Ratatui's widget-based abstraction.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the technical feasibility of rendering text-based UIs on modern embedded hardware, the comparison between Rust and C/C++ for embedded development, and practical applications of the library.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on rendering efficiency. One user argued that text-based graphics are "crazy efficient," citing classic 8-bit computers. However, others countered that modern embedded displays (like SPI/I2C screens) are bitmap-based rather than tile-based; drawing characters as pixel bitmaps can actually be more computationally expensive than drawing geometric shapes directly. It was noted that while text UIs might reduce developer complexity, they don't inherently offer a hardware performance advantage on modern screens.

The conversation also featured a detailed comparison of Rust versus C/C++ for embedded systems. A user with experience in both Rust (using the Embassy framework) and Arduino C++ highlighted Rust's advantages, including its Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that reduces vendor lock-in, typestate patterns that enforce safety at compile time (e.g., preventing pin conflicts), and the ease of using async/await for concurrency. While acknowledging that C++ still has a larger ecosystem, the consensus was that Rust is a rapidly maturing and viable option.

Practically, users discussed integrating Mousefood with specific hardware, such as the "Cheap Yellow Display" (CYD) and the Raspberry Pi Pico. The author confirmed compatibility with displays already using `embedded-graphics` and mentioned ongoing work to handle touch input. The project also sparked nostalgia for text-based interfaces in games like *ComputerCraft*, aligning with the library's aesthetic goals.

## [Jellyfin LLM/"AI" Development Policy](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/contributing/llm-policies/)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46801976

> **Article:** The article links to the Jellyfin project's official development policy regarding the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and "AI" tools. The policy explicitly prohibits the use of LLMs for direct communication, such as issue reports, pull request descriptions, and comments. The core principle is that contributors must understand and be able to defend their own contributions.

However, the policy makes a specific carve-out for using LLMs as an accessibility tool for translation or grammar correction, provided the contributor is non-native in English and is using it to convey their own thoughts more clearly. The use of LLMs for generating code is permitted, but the contributor remains fully responsible for the quality, testing, and maintenance of that code.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News reveals a strong consensus that the Jellyfin policy is both necessary and reasonable. The community is largely supportive of banning LLM-generated communication, viewing it as a matter of respect, accountability, and efficiency.

A central theme is the distinction between LLM-generated code and LLM-generated prose. Many commenters, even those who heavily use AI for coding, feel that writing should be a direct expression of human thought and intent. A quote from a Ted Chiang story is used to argue that the act of writing is integral to the act of thinking, a process that is bypassed when using an LLM. There is a palpable sense of frustration with having to decipher low-effort, "slop" communication from contributors who clearly haven't engaged with their own material.

The carve-out for translation and grammar assistance is widely seen as a positive and important exception. Commenters emphasize that this is a valid use of LLMs as an accessibility tool to help non-native speakers participate more effectively, not a loophole for generating content from scratch.

However, there is a notable tension in the discussion regarding the use of LLMs for code. Some participants point out that the arguments against LLM prose (e.g., lack of understanding, loss of thought process) could also be applied to LLM-generated code. This leads to an unresolved debate about whether there is a fundamental difference between the two, or if the community is simply more willing to automate the "mechanical" parts of development (coding) over the "human" parts (communication).

Finally, the discussion touches on the practical consequences of the AI deluge. One commenter notes that the Jellyfin project's issue tracker has been flooded with low-quality, LLM-generated PRs and comments, making it difficult for maintainers to do their work. This leads to concerns about the future of open-source contribution models, with some fearing that projects may have to restrict contributions to trusted members to cope with the "unlimited slop."

## [In 6 violent encounters, evidence contradicts immigration officials' narratives](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/evidence-contradicts-trump-immigration-officials-accounts-violent-encounters-2026-01-27/)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46803229

> **Article:** This Reuters article investigates six specific violent encounters between federal immigration agents and civilians during a recent surge in enforcement operations. The report analyzes video footage, official statements, and independent accounts to find significant discrepancies between the narratives released by immigration officials and the evidence. In multiple instances, officials described subjects as "violent" or "aggressive" to justify the use of force, while video evidence suggests the individuals were either unarmed, retreating, or were U.S. citizens caught in the crossfire. The article highlights a pattern where initial official justifications for violence are later contradicted by on-the-ground reporting and footage.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized and focuses less on the specific cases in the article and more on the broader political and social implications of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

A central theme is the debate over the necessity and nature of force used by federal agents. One side argues that the tactics are unnecessarily violent and that a lack of nonviolent crowd control expertise is creating dangerous situations. A counter-argument questions why crowd control is needed at all, suggesting that ICE operations historically did not provoke such public opposition. This leads to a deeper debate about the current administration's policies; several commenters argue that the perceived lack of due process, the threat of deportation to foreign prisons, and the potential for citizens to be wrongly detained have fundamentally changed the public's reaction, justifying protests and opposition.

Another major thread concerns the erosion of trust in official narratives. Many commenters express dismay that government officials rush to defend agents and release misleading statements, which are then accepted by their supporters despite contradictory video evidence. This is framed as an escalation in rhetoric, with some pointing to the quick labeling of victims as "domestic terrorists" as a dangerous precedent. However, some argue that this is not a new phenomenon but rather a continuation of how the government has historically treated people of color and dissenters.

Finally, there is a meta-discussion about media bias and nuance. One commenter criticizes the Reuters article for omitting certain details, while others retort that the context of a potentially violent confrontation justifies the subject's actions. The conversation culminates in starkly different views on the state of the country, with some commenters using terms like "fascism" and "occupation," while others dismiss such concerns as hyperbole.

## [Ross Stevens Donates $100M to Pay Every US Olympian and Paralympian $200k](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/sporting/a70171886/ross-stevens-american-olympians-donation/)
**Score:** 141 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46803549

> **Article:** Billionaire financier Ross Stevens has pledged $100 million to the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), which will provide $200,000 to every U.S. Olympian and Paralympian. The donation is structured in two parts: $100,000 payable 20 years after an athlete's first qualifying appearance or at age 45 (whichever is later), and an additional $100,000 guaranteed benefit payable to the athlete's family upon their death. Stevens stated the goal is to ensure financial insecurity does not prevent elite athletes from achieving excellence.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion is divided into two primary themes: the utility of the donation's structure and the political context surrounding the gift.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on whether the delayed payment structure actually helps athletes. Many commenters argue that the money is inaccessible when athletes need it most—during their training and competition years. They contend that promising funds decades in the future or upon death does not help with immediate expenses like rent, coaching, or equipment. Some users suggested this structure is a "paternalistic" loophole to preserve amateur status or simply a way for the donor to inflate the perceived value of the gift through compounding interest. Conversely, a few users defended the structure, arguing it allows for "income smoothing," long-term financial planning (like college funds), and acts as a form of life insurance, which is relevant for athletes in dangerous sports.

The second major theme involves the donation's origin story. Several commenters provided context that Stevens' funds were originally intended for the University of Pennsylvania. He reportedly withdrew the donation due to the university's handling of protests regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict. This led to a heated sub-discussion about the geopolitical situation itself, with users debating the morality of the protests and the broader context of civilian casualties in international conflicts. While some viewed the redirection of funds as a political statement, others framed it as a donor seeking "excellence" elsewhere.

## [I stopped following the news](https://mertbulan.com/2026/01/28/why-i-stopped-following-the-news/)
**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46792580

> **Article:** The article "I stopped following the news" argues that constant news consumption is detrimental to mental well-being and productivity. The author posits that the 24-hour news cycle thrives on sensationalism and negativity, leading to anxiety, outrage, and a false sense of urgency without providing actionable value. He advocates for a "slow news" approach: consuming news on a low-frequency basis, such as reading a weekly summary or a monthly magazine. This method allows stories to develop fully, filters out short-term noise, and frees up time and mental energy for personal life, work, and deeper understanding of complex issues.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely a debate between the psychological benefits of disengaging from the news and the civic duty of staying informed.

A significant portion of the comments support the article's premise, sharing personal anecdotes of improved mental health and productivity after reducing news intake. These users often describe the news as a source of stress, anger, and distraction, likening the feeling to "eating fast food." Some propose practical solutions for low-frequency consumption, such as reading weekly print publications (like *The Economist*), using Wikipedia's "Current Events" portal, or creating custom browser extensions that deliver only essential business news.

However, a strong counter-argument emerges around the theme of civic responsibility. Several users argue that disengaging from the news is a "privilege" that can only be afforded by those whose lives are not directly impacted by political events. They contend that an informed citizenry is essential for the functioning of democracy and that ignoring the news is a form of apathy that allows authoritarianism and injustice to flourish. This debate is sharpened by users who feel personally targeted by current legislation (e.g., a transgender user in the UK), stating that for them, staying informed is a matter of survival rather than a choice.

A recurring sub-thread addresses the overwhelming prevalence of American politics on global platforms like Hacker News. Non-US users express frustration that unrelated forums are dominated by US-centric political debates, while some US users retort that global events, particularly those involving the US, have worldwide consequences and cannot be ignored. The discussion also touches on the quality of information, with some commenters distinguishing between "being informed" (a deep, historical understanding) and "consuming news" (a shallow, reactive habit), suggesting the latter is more harmful than helpful.

## [Computer History Museum Launches Digital Portal to Its Collection](https://computerhistory.org/press-releases/computer-history-museum-launches-digital-portal-to-its-vast-collection/)
**Score:** 127 | **Comments:** 22 | **ID:** 46798994

> **Article:** The Computer History Museum (CHM) has launched a new digital portal providing online access to its vast collection of artifacts, documents, and media. This initiative makes a significant portion of the museum's holdings—including vintage marketing materials, lectures, and oral histories—available to a global audience for the first time.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded with widespread enthusiasm for the launch, with many commenters sharing personal connections to the museum. A recurring theme was the value of the museum in contextualizing the history of technology for younger generations, highlighted by a story of a junior employee's astonishment at seeing a physical floppy disk. Several CHM employees and visitors chimed in, expressing excitement and praising the quality of the museum's content, particularly its extensive oral histories with key figures in computing.

While the overall sentiment was positive, a few users offered constructive criticism. One commenter pointed out that the museum's narrative remains heavily centered on Silicon Valley, urging it to include more on early alternative computer architectures, such as those developed by the NSA's predecessor. Another user noted a specific issue with the portal's search functionality, questioning why a particular oral history wasn't appearing in the results. The discussion also included numerous recommendations for in-person visits and other related resources, such as the American Computer and Robotics Museum in Montana.
