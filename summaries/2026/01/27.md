## [U.S. government has lost more than 10k STEM PhDs since Trump took office](https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 179 | **ID:** 46784263

> **Article:** A Science.org article reports that the U.S. government has lost more than 10,000 STEM PhD employees since President Trump took office in January 2025. The article highlights significant brain drain from federal agencies, with cuts to research funding, hiring freezes, and hostile policies toward international researchers driving departures. The National Science Foundation's budget was reportedly cut by 55% in the first year, and the administration's stance on immigration has made it harder to recruit and retain foreign talent.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep polarization about whether this brain drain represents a genuine crisis or a necessary correction. One prominent thread features JuniperMesos arguing that the assumption this is automatically bad is flawed, contending that academia produces substantial low-quality research and that not all PhDs merit government employment. This provokes strong rebuttals, particularly from ixtli, who counters that there's no evidence the departing researchers are underperformers—rather, the most capable likely leave first—and that shrinking basic research funding endangers the foundational science behind breakthroughs like mRNA vaccines and the internet.

The debate expands to global competitiveness, with sheikhnbake and others noting China's accelerating production of STEM graduates while the West retreats. Retric reframes the scale of loss: evaluating 10 individuals differs fundamentally from losing 10,000, suggesting systemic damage beyond individual performance questions. Retired engineers from the Netherlands and elsewhere describe similar brain drains in Europe, driven by cost-of-living pressures and funding cuts, painting a pessimistic picture of Western scientific infrastructure.

Private sector alternatives generate mixed reactions. ccheney suggests fusion startups and space companies might productively absorb these researchers, but kaitai pushes back sharply, noting that "productive" in DOGE-era rhetoric means profitable, not socially valuable—using a VA physician example of someone accepting lower pay for mission-driven work that would be distorted by profit-maximizing incentives. throwaway173738 reinforces this with concrete examples: NOAA provides essential public weather infrastructure that private competitors like AccuWeather neither replicate nor maintain.

Underlying tensions surface about political manipulation of discourse. Several commenters express alarm that this will be celebrated as good news, with BrenBarn calling this reaction "the scarier part." Practical concerns emerge too: mekdoonggi describes VA cuts disguised through hiring freezes and position elimination, while titzer emphasizes the compounding damage from NSF budget slashing and anti-immigrant policies. The thread closes with darker notes—speed_spark's metaphor of "political self-trepanation" and snarky_dog's reference to violence against healthcare workers—suggesting commenters see this not merely as policy debate but as institutional self-destruction with unpredictable consequences.

## [A list of fun destinations for telnet](https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46775135

> **Article:** A curated list of active telnet-accessible destinations including ASCII art animations (notably Star Wars), MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), bulletin boards, and other text-based services. The page serves as a directory for exploring the remaining corners of the internet that still operate via the unencrypted, plain-text telnet protocol.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion evokes strong nostalgia for the "literary age of the internet" — a time of text-based interfaces free from JavaScript frameworks, loading spinners, and cookie banners. Many commenters share formative experiences: discovering telnet through the famous Star Wars ASCII animation (towel.blinkenlights.nl), debugging web applications by hand-crafting SMTP or POP3 sessions, and losing countless hours to MUDs in the 90s. The thread doubles as a living memory of how early developers learned networking protocols by reading RFCs and typing raw commands.

Practical concerns thread through the nostalgia. Modern systems no longer ship telnet by default due to security risks, prompting one user to share a Python telnet client implementation using telnetlib3. A security debate emerges around whether ANSI escape sequences in telnet sessions pose meaningful danger compared to JavaScript in browsers — with one participant noting CVE-2024-56803 as evidence that terminal emulators can indeed be exploited through malformed escape sequences.

The community troubleshoots together: towel.blinkenlights.nl is confirmed still running (IPv6-enabled with additions), though some report connectivity issues; telehack.com is suggested as an alternative. A humorous captcha on telnet.wiki.gd — "Repeat the first spacecraft to land on another planet three times" — trips up multiple users before the answer ("Venera Venera Venera") is cracked through collective experimentation.

Underlying the technical exchange is a wistful speculation about retreating from the modern web's "AI slop, popups, fake news, propaganda and ads" toward simpler text-based protocols — Gopher, Gemini, IRC — though participants acknowledge advertisers would likely follow. The thread closes with MUD recommendations (BatMUD, ancient.anguish.org) and one developer hoping to list their own in-development game, keeping the tradition alive.

## [430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/science/archaeology-neanderthals-tools.html)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46781530

> **Article:** Archaeologists have discovered 430,000-year-old wooden tools in Germany, making them the oldest well-preserved wooden tools ever found. The tools were likely made by Neanderthals or their immediate ancestors, predating Homo sapiens by over 100,000 years. The find is notable primarily for the exceptional preservation of organic material—wood typically decomposes rapidly, leaving little trace in the archaeological record.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion opened with surprise at the age of the tools, with user drakythe questioning whether 430,000 years could be correct given their understanding of human history. This prompted informative corrections from several users explaining that tool use long predates Homo sapiens: the Oldowan stone tool industry dates back 2–3 million years, and indirect evidence of woodworking exists from at least 1.5 million years ago. The significance of this find, as throwup238 clarified, lies in preservation rather than behavior—wooden artifacts this old are extraordinarily rare.

The conversation took a darker turn when JumpCrisscross invoked Jane Goodall's observation about "genocidal tendencies" in humans, chimpanzees, and wolves, suggesting that early humans may have been uniquely intolerant of coexisting with other hominid species. This sparked mixed reactions, with some finding it thought-provoking and others dismissing it as unsubstantiated speculation.

A fringe perspective emerged from an0malous, who cited Michael Cremo's "Forbidden Archaeology" to claim even older tool evidence is suppressed by academic dogma. This triggered substantial pushback, including dang marking the thread as off-topic. However, 3RTB297 offered a nuanced defense, acknowledging that scientific institutions do exhibit resistance to paradigm-shifting discoveries, citing historical examples like plate tectonics, warm-blooded dinosaurs, and the Chicxulub impact—though they stopped short of endorsing Cremo's specific claims.

Practical discussion followed about the original site's unavailability due to traffic, with users sharing alternative sources. A tangential thread explored construction materials, with melenaboija reflecting on wood's durability and environmental trade-offs compared to concrete, and barbacoa noting how Roman concrete outlasts modern reinforced concrete due to iron rebar corrosion.

Finally, users speculated about undiscovered underwater archaeology (throwup238 noted rapid advances in this field) and how even older tool discoveries might reshape understanding—though uriegas suggested such finds would merely reinforce growing recognition of continuity between humans and other tool-using animals.

## [Xfwl4 – The Roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor](https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_15.html)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46779645

> **Article:** The article outlines the development roadmap for "xfwl4," a new Wayland compositor for the XFCE desktop environment. The project aims to replace xfwm4 (XFCE's X11 window manager) with a modern Rust-based compositor built on the Smithay library, while maintaining behavioral compatibility with the existing XFCE experience. The roadmap covers four phases: establishing core infrastructure, implementing basic window management, achieving feature parity with xfwm4, and eventually adding new capabilities. The author emphasizes that this is a long-term effort requiring community support and careful attention to preserving XFCE's lightweight, traditional feel.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on whether XFCE's traditional userbase will accept Wayland and Rust, with opinions divided. One commenter (jchw) hopes XFCE stays lightweight and notes that while they personally support Wayland and Rust, they worry about conservative users seeing these as "complex, bloated, and unnecessary." Another long-time XFCE user (coldpie) disputes this characterization, arguing that XFCE users simply want things that work without arbitrary change, and that most don't care about implementation languages. They predict the transition will be smooth and that resistant users will become a vocal minority similar to SysV-init holdouts.

A significant thread explores Wayland's merits and drawbacks. One skeptical commenter (ok123456) calls Wayland a "regression" citing usability problems, missing features requiring workarounds, and fragmentation—comparing it unfavorably to X400 versus SMTP. In response, jchw offers a detailed defense: Wayland avoids X11's ossification by being protocol-only, handles modern needs like DPI scaling and HDR better, and improves security through client isolation. They acknowledge Wayland's radical design (no global coordinate space, compositor-centric architecture) creates friction and slow development, but argue the results work well in practice. They note that some application features remain unimplementable due to unfinished protocols, but consider these growing pains worth the long-term architectural benefits.

Performance concerns emerge regarding mandatory compositing in Wayland versus XFCE's traditional ability to disable compositing for low-latency operation on weak hardware. One commenter (Fiveplus) questions whether xfwl4 can replicate xfwm4's responsiveness, particularly for focus management and input latency. jchw confirms some latency increase is inevitable but mitigable through hardware plane unredirection and higher refresh rates, while conceding that very old hardware may simply fall below the supported threshold. Another user bluntly states Wayland has "consistently been slower than X11."

## [Russia using Interpol's wanted list to target critics abroad, leak reveals](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gg729y1yo)
**Score:** 205 | **Comments:** 66 | **ID:** 46776454

> **Article:** A BBC investigation reveals leaked documents showing Russia has been systematically misusing Interpol's wanted list to target political opponents and business figures abroad. The case of Russian businessman Dmitry Pestrikov is highlighted—he fled Russia in 2022 after allegedly taking 250 million rubles from his company, was placed on Interpol's Red Notice list, and spent nearly two years wanted before Interpol's Commission for the Control of Files (CCF) ruled his case was "predominantly political" and cancelled the request. The documents show Russia provided "generic and formulaic" information with inadequate explanation of alleged crimes. The investigation suggests this is part of a broader pattern of authoritarian states weaponizing international law enforcement mechanisms.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals significant skepticism about both the article's framing and Russia's motives, with commenters debating whether Pestrikov is genuinely a political victim or a criminal using that narrative to avoid extradition. User kgeist provides detailed counter-narrative research suggesting Pestrikov's history—1990s privatization deals, tax evasion cases, a 2021 incident threatening people with a rifle, and fleeing with company funds—points to a "90s mafia" figure rather than government critic. Others note this binary may be false: lazide observes that in Russia's politicized judiciary, "every case is a political case," while pydry argues oligarchs from the "post-Soviet gangster 90s" don't fit the profile of "beleaguered peace activists."

Several commenters cite established precedents of Interpol abuse, particularly the Bill Browder case (s_dev) and Turkey's long-standing pattern of targeting critics abroad (BeetleB). The technical workings of Interpol notices generate practical discussion—JasonADrury notes cryptocurrency-paid services to check one's status, while bilekas and strken clarify that most Red Notices are restricted to law enforcement, with only minority made public.

The conversation expands to broader patterns of state abuse: preisschild describes an ongoing Austrian case of FSB agents obtaining journalist addresses through official channels, while goinghjuk and dvfjsdhgfv outline systematic methods including fabricating crimes for arrested affiliates and entrapping businesspeople through necessary illegal payments. Comparisons emerge to Brazil (hexage1814) and the Dutch Tax Authority (mvdwoord), though these draw requests for citations.

Meta-discussion touches on platform norms—cpursley flags concerns about political posts devolving into "Reddit-style" hostility, while SanjayMehta's question about "ruzzians" spelling prompts explanation (distinguishing pro-war Russians via the Z symbol). The thread exemplifies HN's tendency toward source skepticism, with multiple users independently researching subjects and challenging media framing, even when criticizing authoritarian governments.

## [India and EU announce landmark trade deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrnee01r9jo)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 136 | **ID:** 46778821

> **Article:** The BBC reports on a landmark trade agreement announced between India and the European Union, the result of over 20 years of negotiations. The deal aims to reduce tariffs on goods including EU exports of cars, wine, and spirits to India, while Indian pharmaceuticals and textiles would face lower barriers in Europe. A key component is a "mobility framework" intended to ease short-term travel restrictions for professionals between India and the EU. The agreement comes amid shifting global trade dynamics, with both sides seeking to diversify partnerships beyond traditional allies. However, Reuters reporting on draft terms suggests some details, particularly around mobility provisions, may differ from initial BBC reporting.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly fragmented into several contentious threads, with immigration dominating despite the article's focus on trade.

**Immigration as wedge issue.** The most heated exchanges centered on whether the mobility framework would increase Indian immigration to Western countries. User "breitling" sparked controversy by claiming Canadians' "greatest fear" regarding an India trade deal was immigration, citing polling data showing it as a top-five issue. This was challenged by "uv-depression" as projection, and "alephnerd" flagged suspicious patterns of new accounts using immigration to derail discussion—later noting Reuters's draft terms didn't actually mention mobility provisions. Canadian users debated whether their immigration was "lop-sided" toward India, with "poncho_romero" describing recent shifts toward low-wage Indian workers that had turned previously pro-immigration Canadians skeptical. "k4rli" explicitly advocated for European immigration from "culturally more similar" South America rather than India.

**Economic competition and talent flows.** Several users analyzed the deal's implications for global talent competition. "augusteo" framed easier mobility as positive for skilled workers who currently face painful life disruptions, contrasting the EU approach with US H-1B anxiety. "Espressosaurus" asked whether US immigration restrictions might enable "a European flowering," though "fooker" countered that EU tech salaries (except Zurich/London) had stagnated to Bangalore-comparable levels, while US compensation remained 3-4× higher even accounting for healthcare. "lawn" noted European social benefits (education, childcare) narrow this gap.

**Broader geopolitical framing.** "alephnerd" provided extensive context on Chinese diplomatic opposition to the deal, linking it to defense technology cooperation and alleged disinformation operations against French-Indian military partnerships. "deafpolygon" positioned the agreement as stabilizing against "Trump's tariff shenanigans."

**Meta-discussion and media criticism.** Users noted the BBC's US-only paywall ("profsummergig," "dewey"), with "lenkite" observing the article itself was relatively neutral. "diego_moita" expressed surprise at EU effectiveness given two major trade deals in one month, while "snowpid" and "etyhhgfff" debated whether EU institutional constraints (vetoes, court challenges) would ultimately block implementation—as already seen with EU-Mercosur.

A running tension persisted between users treating immigration as central to the deal's significance and others, particularly "alephnerd," arguing this framing was factually inaccurate and potentially coordinated manipulation.

## [iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/iphone-5s-software-update/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46774108

> **Article:** Apple released a software update for the iPhone 5s, a device launched in September 2013, approximately 13 years after its original release. The update (version 12.5.7) replaces an expired security certificate that was preventing the device from functioning properly, rather than adding new features or security patches. The iPhone 5s was the first iPhone with Touch ID and a 64-bit processor, and it originally shipped with iOS 7.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely centers on evaluating Apple's legacy support practices, with participants offering varied perspectives on what this update signifies. Several commenters praised Apple for maintaining functionality on such an old device, contrasting it sharply with Android's update ecosystem—where even expensive flagship phones often lose support within 18-24 months. Pixel phones were suggested as the best Android option for timely updates, though one participant cautioned about persistent emergency calling bugs in that line.

A key technical clarification emerged: this was purely a certificate replacement, not substantive software maintenance. Some participants argued this distinction makes the gesture less impressive, with one sarcastically noting that old Mac OS X versions still can't access the App Store. Others countered that preventing "paperweight" status through certificate updates is still meaningful, as many companies abandon devices entirely when backend certificates expire.

The conversation touched on why Apple might bother—speculation included minimizing support costs, avoiding legal liability for bricked emergency devices, and maintaining brand reputation. Several participants shared personal experiences with aging iPhones, including original iPhone SE users reporting acceptable performance for basic tasks like messaging, authenticators, and Apple Pay, albeit with app compatibility limitations. The discussion also veered into hardware longevity more broadly, with mentions of Sony's continued PS3 Blu-ray DRM updates and AMD's mixed record on GPU driver support.

A minority view suggested Apple should go further by officially supporting jailbreaking for obsolete devices, allowing community maintenance. The thread concluded with at least one counterexample of Apple *not* supporting old hardware—one user reported their iPhone 6S Plus was effectively bricked when Apple ID login was disabled for older iOS versions, creating a catch-22 where updating required login but login required updating.

## [State of the Windows: What is going on with Windows 11?](https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2026/01/25/state-of-the-windows-what-is-going-on-with-windows-11/)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46772212

> **Article:** The linked article (dated January 25, 2026) analyzes the current state of Windows 11, examining Microsoft's direction with the operating system. Based on discussion context, it likely covers Windows 11's controversial UI changes, persistent bloatware, advertising integration, Copilot AI features, and the ongoing fragmentation between modern Settings and legacy Control Panel interfaces. The article appears critical of Microsoft's prioritization of monetization and data collection over user experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep frustration with Windows 11 across multiple dimensions, though with notable disagreement about severity and alternatives.

**Core Criticisms of Windows 11**
Multiple users describe Windows 11 as "disaster" and "out of touch," with wewewedxfgdf arguing people want "a simple, clean, minimal, consistent OS that does not have anyone's interests first except the user"—suggesting Windows 95 came closer to this ideal. Specific pain points include dark patterns pushing OneDrive, intrusive ads, Copilot integration, pre-installed bloatware like Candy Crush, and the schizophrenic split between modern Settings and legacy Control Panel interfaces that Microsoft has failed to resolve since Windows 8.

**Why Microsoft Isn't Fixing It**
Several commenters explain the apparent complacency: hackyhacky notes Windows is now primarily a "telemetry-collection system" rather than a profit center, with revenue coming from Azure and services. Additionally, most users lack viable alternatives—enterprises lock employees into Windows, budget consumers won't pay Mac premiums, and Linux remains unknown to mainstream users. Thewebguyd adds that kernel-level anti-cheat requirements for PC gaming create lock-in that even Linux's gaming improvements can't overcome.

**Mitigation Strategies**
Pragmatic users share workarounds: mattbee recommends debloater scripts (specifically Win11Debloat) and tools like StartAllBack to restore classic functionality, noting that with 32GB+ RAM and cleanup, Windows becomes "a pretty stable system." Conception suggests purchasing IoT LTSC licenses for officially debloated versions. However, Telaneo counters that even these fixes are incomplete, as the new Settings panel still lacks over 70% of old Control Panel functionality after years of "transition."

**The Alternative Landscape**
The discussion debates whether alternatives are genuinely viable. Lateforwork claims macOS 26 (Tahoe) is "an even bigger disaster," though yearolinuxdsktp dismisses this as aesthetic purism from John Gruber rather than substantive criticism. Linux generates mixed assessments: aucisson_masque and lysace share success stories with non-technical users, while tokyobreakfast criticizes desktop environments as "crazy bloated" with inconsistent configuration scattered across "WM control panel or the DE control panel or some obscure .conf file." Princevegeta89 maintains Linux remains too confusing for "casual, average users" despite enterprise support from RedHat and Ubuntu.

**Generational and Accessibility Concerns**
Ggm's experience helping seniors reveals practical friction points: users want local backup options without OneDrive dark patterns and customizable backgrounds beyond Microsoft's presets. Interestingly, many seniors want iPhone/iPad compatibility with Windows rather than switching to Mac—often due to perceived Office compatibility issues that ggm considers unfounded.

**Meta-Commentary on Criticism**
Timpera cautions that HN negativity may be an "echo chamber," though wewewedxfgdf counters that "HN users are the global thought leaders and influencers in technology" whose opinions shape broader tech discourse. Galleywest200 confirms similar frustration appears in PC gaming YouTube comments, while acknowledging algorithmic filtering effects.

**Score:** 120 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46776272

> **Article:** France has passed legislation banning social media use by children under 15 years old. The bill prohibits minors under 15 from accessing "online social network services provided by an online platform," requiring platforms to implement age verification measures. However, the Conseil d'État (France's highest administrative court) issued a skeptical opinion, noting that only the EU can impose new obligations on digital platforms, and legal experts warn the bill is "legally fragile" based on a questionable interpretation of European rules. Sanctions for major platforms like Instagram or Snapchat would fall under European Commission jurisdiction.

## [DHS: Critical ICE surveillance footage from abuse case was never recorded](https://www.404media.co/dhs-says-critical-ice-surveillance-footage-from-abuse-case-was-actually-never-recorded-doesnt-matter/)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 15 | **ID:** 46783177

> **Article:** The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims that critical surveillance footage from an ICE facility—potentially related to an abuse case—was never actually recorded. According to 404 Media's reporting, DHS is arguing that even if the footage had existed, it wouldn't matter because the underlying problem has since been fixed. The circumstances have drawn skepticism given the convenient timing of the missing evidence.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly bifurcated into procedural complaints about flagging and substantive skepticism about the government's explanation. Multiple users noted that 404 Media articles are automatically flagged on HN, with ronsor clarifying that the deeper issue is topicality—politics and crime stories generally fall outside HN's guidelines.

On the substance, commenters expressed deep cynicism. jandrese applied a "bullshit filter" to conclude the footage was likely deleted for being incriminating, while cucumber3732842 offered a more institutional critique: careerist government employees don't need explicit orders to make embarrassing evidence disappear, describing this as "SOP slimy government behavior" spanning from local bureaucracies to intelligence agencies. jandrese pushed back by citing specific examples of apparent dishonesty from current DHS leadership, framing it as competence sacrificed for loyalty.

The Epstein case surfaced repeatedly as a reference point—belter sarcastically referenced the "same team" handling those cameras, and goatlover detailed recently surfaced footage contradicting official accounts about camera malfunctions during Epstein's death. Brian_K_White lamented the lost norm that "appearance of impropriety" once mattered as much as actual wrongdoing, while the_snooze's systems-thinking aphorism ("The purpose of a system is what it does") implicitly framed the "missing" footage as functioning exactly as designed.
