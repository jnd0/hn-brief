# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-27

## [Kimi Released Kimi K2.5, Open-Source Visual SOTA-Agentic Model](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html)
**Score:** 286 | **Comments:** 103 | **ID:** 46775961

> **Article:** Moonshot AI released Kimi K2.5, a 1 trillion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 32 billion active parameters. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on visual and agentic tasks, including ranking in the top 50th percentile on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark. Key capabilities include self-directed "agent swarms" with up to 100 parallel sub-agents and 1,500 tool calls for complex task execution, which reportedly reduces end-to-end runtime by 80%. The model is released under an MIT license with a modification requiring prominent branding display for commercial products exceeding 100 million monthly active users or $20 million monthly revenue. It is available through Kimi's API and various providers including OpenRouter.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: hardware requirements and deployment feasibility, the business rationale behind releasing such an expensive model openly, and technical details about the model's architecture and capabilities.

**Infrastructure Reality Check**
Commenters quickly established that despite only 32B active parameters, the full 1T parameter model demands serious hardware. One user calculated that a realistic deployment requires 16× H100 80GB GPUs with NVLink—roughly $500K–$700K upfront or $40–60/hour on-demand. This sparked debate when another suggested two Mac Studios with Thunderbolt 5 as a "$20K alternative," which was countered that Thunderbolt bandwidth cannot handle expert routing compared to NVLink, making inference "impractically slow." However, defenders noted people already run the previous Kimi K2 on 2–4 Mac Studios at 21–30 tokens/second, suggesting near-term feasibility despite current limitations.

**Open-Source Strategy and Licensing**
The modified MIT license drew significant attention—particularly the requirement to "prominently display Kimi K2.5" for high-revenue commercial use. One commenter quipped this was essentially asking for "$1 million" in branding value rather than cash, while others defended it as more practical than direct fees that could bankrupt growing companies. The broader question of "why give away millions in training costs" generated speculation ranging from Chinese state interests in nullifying US AI dominance, to mindshare accumulation against closed competitors, to a two-sided business model where open weights drive API usage since few can self-host anyway.

**Agent Swarms and Technical Architecture**
The "agent swarm" capability—where K2.5 self-directs up to 100 specialized sub-agents in parallel—prompted both curiosity and skepticism. Commenters explained this as "agent orchestration" or "hiring a team of people who get specialized on one problem," with parallels drawn to existing tools like Claude's skills interface and Gas town's parallel coding approach. Some questioned whether this differed meaningfully from standard MoE architecture or simply parallel API calls, with the consensus being that RL-trained orchestration of task decomposition represents a genuine advance.

**Comparative Performance and Market Position**
Users noted pricing on OpenRouter around $0.50–$0.60 per million input tokens and $2.50–$3.00 per million output tokens—competitive with Claude Haiku. Benchmark discussions highlighted Gemini's strength in image/video, Claude in coding, and ChatGPT in general knowledge, though several commenters reported Gemini Pro outperforming expectations across their personal workflows. The release timing—one year after DeepSeek's open-source breakthrough—prompted reflection on how rapidly "magic technology" has become freely available compared to the "protect us all" closed-source rhetoric of earlier AI leaders.

## [Celebrities say they are being censored by TikTok after speaking out against ICE](https://www.pride.com/culture/celebrities/tiktok-censoring-megan-stalter-and-finneas)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 136 | **ID:** 46777652

> **Article:** The article reports that celebrities including Megan Stalter and Finneas (Billie Eilish's brother) claim their TikTok content criticizing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has been suppressed or censored on the platform. The piece suggests this may be connected to TikTok's recent forced sale to a consortium led by Oracle's Larry Ellison, a Trump ally, following prolonged political pressure on the Chinese-owned platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly polarized around whether the alleged censorship represents genuine political suppression or is being mischaracterized by out-of-touch celebrities. One early comment dismissed the claims as "virtue signaling," prompting immediate pushback about whether opposing what some view as fascist policies can fairly be dismissed as performative activism. This spawned a substantial sub-thread debating the definition of fascism itself, with one participant arguing that true fascism would involve immediate arrest or death for dissenters—a claim others contested by pointing to the gradual consolidation of Nazi power and drawing parallels to current paramilitary activity by unidentified federal agents.

A significant portion of commentary focused on TikTok's new ownership structure under Oracle and the political connections between Larry Ellison, Donald Trump, and the current administration. Several commenters expressed alarm at how rapidly the platform's environment appeared to shift, with one linking to legal scholarship criticizing the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in the TikTok case as enabling government manipulation of private speech platforms. This prompted a tangential debate about whether "ultra-capitalism" represents a coherent analytical category or merely a pejorative for disliked outcomes.

Alternative explanations for the visibility changes were proposed, including ordinary algorithmic unpredictability and self-fulfilling myths about keyword-based "resets" circulating among users. However, others countered that documented collusion between tech billionaires and the political establishment made deliberate throttling plausible. The conversation also touched on platform alternatives, with some suggesting Douyin (Chinese TikTok) or Bluesky as refuges, while others questioned whether any large-audience platform could resist US government pressure.

The thread revealed sharp partisan divisions, with some commenters defending ICE's role in enforcing federal law and others citing polling showing majority opposition to the agency. Several participants noted the article's heavy reliance on anecdote rather than systematic data—a limitation others attributed to platform opacity rather than journalistic failure. The discussion concluded with meta-commentary about why such threads get flagged on Hacker News, with accusations that government supporters suppress uncomfortable topics rather than engage substantively.

## [A list of fun destinations for telnet](https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46775135

> **Article:** A curated list of fun and notable destinations accessible via telnet, including ASCII art animations (most famously Star Wars), games, BBS systems, and other text-based services. The list showcases remnants of early internet culture that remain accessible through this legacy protocol.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion evokes strong nostalgia for telnet as a "secret passage" into internet history. Many commenters share formative memories: discovering the Star Wars ASCII animation (towel.blinkenlights.nl), learning email protocols by hand through POP3/SMTP, bypassing school firewalls in 2008, and building their first email clients and web servers after studying RFCs. Several note telnet's utility as a debugging tool for network diagnostics and its "pure" appeal—text without loading spinners, JavaScript frameworks, or cookie banners.

A minor controversy emerges when some report the famous Star Wars server as dead, though sigio (who knows the creator) confirms it still runs on both IPv4 and IPv6 with some additions. Connection issues for some users suggest IPv6 may be required in certain cases. Alternative destinations surface: telehack.com as a replacement, an SSH-accessible Star Wars mirror at sw.taigrr.com:1977, and notable omissions like nethack.alt.org (which prefers SSH) and various MUDs.

Practical notes thread through: modern systems often lack telnet clients (solved via inetutils-telnet), and VMG warns that ANSI escape sequences can pose security risks including RCE. Some see romantic potential in text-only futures—"No google. No socials. Just text"—while others note the irony that even retro protocols would attract advertisers if popularized. The community's tone balances technical pragmatism with genuine affection for a simpler, more discoverable internet era.

## [iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/iphone-5s-software-update/)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 52 | **ID:** 46774108

> **Article:** Apple released a software update for the iPhone 5s in January 2026, approximately 13 years after the device's 2013 launch. The update (iOS 12.5.7) replaces an expired security certificate to maintain basic functionality for the aging device. This is not a feature update but rather a maintenance fix to prevent the phone from becoming a "paperweight" due to certificate expiration. The iPhone 5s was notable as the first iPhone with a 64-bit processor and Touch ID.

## [Russia using Interpol's wanted list to target critics abroad, leak reveals](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gg729y1yo)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46776454

> **Article:** A BBC investigation reveals leaked documents showing Russia has been systematically using Interpol's wanted list to target political critics and business figures abroad. The case of Vladimir Pestrikov, a former Russian aviation executive, illustrates the pattern: after fleeing Russia in 2022 with 250 million rubles from his company, he discovered Russia had placed him on Interpol's "red diffusion" list. Interpol's own Commission for the Control of Files (CCF) later ruled his case was "predominantly political," noting Russia provided "generic and formulaic" information with inadequate explanation of alleged crimes. The article highlights broader concerns about authoritarian states weaponizing international law enforcement mechanisms against dissidents and businesspeople who fall out of favor.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion quickly fragmented into several overlapping debates. A significant portion questioned whether Pestrikov was genuinely a political target or simply a corrupt oligarch using the "political persecution" narrative to evade legitimate charges—commenter kgeist detailed his history of 1990s privatization deals, tax evasion, and an alleged 2021 incident involving rifle threats, noting he only left Russia after embezzling company funds. Others countered that Russian prosecutors failed to present evidence warranting Interpol involvement, and that Interpol itself ultimately ruled the case political.

The discussion broadened to Russia's broader pattern of abuse, with examples including the BTC-e crypto exchange founder and claims that Russia manufactures crimes against arrested affiliates. One Austrian commenter described an ongoing court case against an intelligence official who allegedly passed journalist addresses to FSB agents, prompting a sub-debate about Austrian complicity through pro-Russian politics and business ties—complete with the derogatory "ruzzians" spelling that another user questioned.

Several threads touched on systemic issues: the UK's reputation as a haven for Russian oligarchs, with specific London mansions named; how authoritarian states force businessmen into technically illegal practices to maintain leverage; and concerns about "hostage diplomacy" targeting Western citizens. The discussion also saw meta-commentary about HN's suitability for political topics, with one user flagging such posts for devolving into "Reddit-style" hostility, and a brief aside about Brazil's judiciary allegedly using similar tactics.

A minor technical thread explored how individuals discover Interpol notices—through direct Interpol contact, $500 cryptocurrency services on Russian forums, or public extracts—with clarification that most red notices remain restricted to law enforcement.

## [France passes bill to ban social media use by under-15s](https://www.rte.ie/news/europe/2026/0127/1555251-france-social-media-ban/)
**Score:** 108 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46776272

> **Article:** France has passed legislation banning social media use by children under 15, requiring platforms to implement age verification systems to enforce the restriction. The bill faces significant legal uncertainty, as France's Conseil d'État (highest administrative court) issued a skeptical opinion arguing that only the EU can impose new obligations on digital platforms. The amended text uses ambiguous language prohibiting access rather than explicitly regulating platforms, but platforms would still need age verification to comply. For major platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, sanctions would fall under European Commission jurisdiction, raising concerns among legal experts about the bill's fragility under European law.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep divisions over both the policy goals and implementation approach of France's social media ban for under-15s.

**Fundamental disagreement about the nature of the problem.** Several commenters, particularly those with early internet experience, distinguished sharply between "old internet" forums and modern social media. mrexroad and others emphasized that 1990s-2000s forums fostered genuine community and lasting friendships, while contemporary platforms employ algorithmic amplification, infinite scroll, and engagement-maximizing dark patterns that create fundamentally different psychological effects—what adev_ termed "doomscrolling" harms to attention span, memory, and cognitive capacity even without exposure to extreme content.

**The regulatory approach debate.** A central tension emerged between banning children from platforms versus regulating the platforms themselves. krainboltgreene advocated for broadcaster-style regulation rather than access restrictions, while terespuwash criticized the ban as isolating teens rather than fixing platforms, comparing it to forbidding children soda at bars that serve alcohol. adev_ countered that the analogy fails: social media harms resemble secondhand smoke, where children need not participate directly to suffer negative effects. nixass and dyauspitr supported the ban, arguing that platform regulation has failed repeatedly and that children's developing brains are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.

**Legal and practical implementation concerns.** timpera highlighted significant legal obstacles, noting the Conseil d'État's skepticism and potential conflicts with EU law. thrance disputed the court's relevance, but timpera clarified that the court could ultimately invalidate enforcement decrees. ekianjo raised surveillance concerns, suggesting age verification would require ID collection from all users.

**Definitional challenges.** quotemstr pressed the difficulty of legally distinguishing harmful from benign platforms, using Hacker News itself as a test case—it employs ranking algorithms, runs on a for-profit model, uses engagement patterns, yet is generally considered valuable for young technologists. Mordisquitos acknowledged this tension but suggested that if modern mainstream platforms are net harmful while niche forums are net beneficial, the relative user bases might justify an imperfect blanket ban.

**Broader societal context.** Several threads touched on parental authority and social dynamics. djtango cited reports of graduates struggling with basic social interaction after being "serially online," while sunshine-o pushed back against technological scapegoating, arguing that family dysfunction and broader social breakdown drive children toward online escape regardless of platform design. johnisgood warned that prohibition approaches repeat drug war failures, though tokioyoyo noted the drug war's mixed international record.

The discussion ultimately reflects unresolved tensions between protecting developmental health, preserving beneficial digital access, respecting privacy, and finding legally enforceable frameworks in an EU-regulated environment.

## [The state of Linux music players in 2026](https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/)
**Score:** 94 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46776564

> **Article:** A 2026 survey of Linux music players, evaluating numerous options against criteria including library management, UI quality, format support, and self-hosting capabilities. The author tested approximately 200 players and highlights several: Amberol (simple, no library management), Euphonia (MPD client, quirky UI), Feishin (Electron-based Subsonic client), Lollypop (GNOME-native, painful UX), Plattenalbum (MPD client, limited browsing), Strawberry (Clementine fork, feature-rich but dated), and Tauon (unique playlist-centric design). The author ultimately settled on Strawberry for desktop use with Navidrome for server functionality, and Tempus for mobile. Notable omissions include KDE's Elisa and DeadBeeF.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a vibrant, opinionated community of Linux music enthusiasts with diverse workflows and strong preferences. A surprising opening comment questioning whether anyone still plays music on computers was quickly countered by numerous users describing their active setups: phones as controllers, Raspberry Pi endpoints, work-focused desktop listening, and elaborate self-hosted libraries.

The conversation surfaced several recurring tensions. **Interface philosophy** proved divisive—many users pine for foobar2000's customizable layout, with DeadBeeF and fooyin recommended as spiritual successors. Others defend MPD-based minimalism (ncmpcpp, rmpc, MyMPD) or embrace modern GTK4/libadwaita designs, though these draw criticism for poor integration outside GNOME. Several KDE users expressed disappointment that Elisa was overlooked in the original article.

**Streaming versus ownership** emerged as a major theme. Users described elaborate migration paths away from Spotify and Tidal, motivated by lost libraries, removed tracks, and data portability concerns. One detailed workflow involves Listenbrainz for discovery, Nicotine for acquisition, beets for organization, and Navidrome for serving—highlighting the technical commitment required for music independence. Music discovery remains the sticking point, with Spotify's algorithm still unmatched by open alternatives.

Technical concerns surfaced throughout: gapless playback is essential for some genres (classical, progressive rock) but seemingly neglected by many players; waveform seekbars are considered mandatory by some yet rare; and mobile/offline workflows remain frustratingly fragmented, particularly around Android audio stacks and DAC compatibility.

The discussion also touched on platform comparisons. Several recent Windows migrants noted Linux's solid foundation but uneven application landscape, while one Mac convert described macOS music software as "designed by aliens" despite the platform's creative reputation. Throughout, there's palpable frustration that no single player satisfies everyone—suggesting the "state" of Linux music players in 2026 remains one of productive fragmentation rather than convergence.

## [Heathrow drops the liquids rule](https://flymag.com/heathrow-drops-the-liquids-rule-what-changes-at-lhr-and-how-close-the-u-s-really-is/)
**Score:** 88 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46774777

> **Article:** The linked article from FlyMag reports that London's Heathrow Airport (LHR) has dropped the 100ml liquid restriction for carry-on luggage, following the installation of new CT scanner technology at security checkpoints. The piece also examines how close the United States is to implementing similar technology and policy changes. However, the article's credibility was immediately questioned by HN commenters, with one user calling it a "blatant AI author" and pointing to a BBC article on the same topic as a more reliable source.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly centered on source quality rather than the news itself. User sgustard identified the FlyMag article as AI-generated and shared a BBC link as a superior alternative. Moderator dang responded by consolidating the thread, moving comments to an earlier submission of the BBC article and re-upping it to give the human-written source priority. This reflects HN's community and moderation norms: crowd-sourced quality detection, swift moderator intervention to elevate credible sources, and a general skepticism toward AI-generated content masquerading as journalism. No substantive discussion of the actual policy change occurred in this thread.

## [TikTok disallows DMs with the word "Epstein"](https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/2015911471507530219)
**Score:** 81 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46773561

> **Article:** A Twitter/X post by user @krassenstein claims that TikTok is blocking direct messages (DMs) containing the word "Epstein" (referring to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and financier). The allegation suggests TikTok has implemented a content filter specifically targeting this name in private messages, though no independent verification or official response from TikTok is included in the linked content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion around this claim is brief but reveals immediate skepticism and political framing. The top comment from zug_zug expresses surprise at the story's lack of visibility and suggests it has been suppressed by "embarrassed individuals"—a sentiment another user extends to argue that powerful actors no longer even pretend embarrassment, instead "actively cover up what is inconvenient." 

Alsetmusic initially believed the post had reached the front page, then corrected themselves, though this correction appears to have been edited into a broader political statement about corruption in "the current admin." The thread's only substantive engagement with the claim itself comes from rand846633, who requests independent verification from TikTok users, highlighting that the discussion is operating entirely on an unverified social media post without replication or confirmation.

The conversation quickly drifts from the specific TikTok allegation toward generalized grievances about institutional corruption and platform censorship, with little technical analysis of how such a filter might work or whether the claim is credible. No participants appear to have actually tested the alleged DM blocking by the time of the comments shown.

## [I made my own Git](https://tonystr.net/blog/git_immitation)
**Score:** 78 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46778341

> **Article:** TonyStr wrote a detailed blog post about building their own Git implementation from scratch. The project, called "tvc" (Tony's Version Control), implements core Git functionality including blob/tree/commit objects, zlib compression (with zstd as an alternative), and basic repository operations. The author walks through the internal data structures that make Git work—content-addressable storage, the object database, references, and how commits form a directed acyclic graph. The implementation is in Rust and serves as an educational deep-dive into version control internals.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion branched into several interesting directions. A practical suggestion from kgeist about using SQLite instead of parsing files led grenran to point out that Fossil SCM already takes this approach, sparking a subthread where users shared their experiences with Fossil. embedding-shape and smartmic both use it for personal projects, praising its local-first design and integrated project management features, though smartmic noted it's better suited for "cathedral" than "bazaar" development models due to its no-rebase philosophy and higher friction for external contributions.

The thread took a meta turn when teiferer observed that articles like this form the training material for coding agents—creating potential circularity if LLMs were used to write them. TonyStr confirmed they only used LLMs for advice on Rust conventions and research pointers (zstd specifically), not for the article itself. This dovetailed with TonyStr's earlier discovery that their repo had 49 clones from 28 unique users before they even published, suggesting automated scraping of new public repositories for LLM training. wasmainiac and jdiff riffed on the idea of "poisoning" LLMs with self-referential content, with jdiff noting that critical evaluation isn't exactly AI's strong suit anyway—a point falcor84 grimly extended by predicting AI source evaluation will improve while humans degrade.

Several commenters shared educational resources: darkryder recommended "Git from the Bottom Up" for understanding Git internals, which spuz gratefully recognized as a long-lost reference. p4bl0 praised ugit as their favorite Git-from-scratch tutorial, and TonyStr bookmarked it. igorw dropped a PHP Git client they'd written by hand. eru questioned the prominence of compression in the article's structure, though alphabetag675 defended this as natural for a learning project.

Technical deep-dives included sluongng connecting zstd dictionary compression to Meta's Sapling VCS, explaining the tradeoffs between Git's delta-compressed packfiles and path-based approaches for large repositories. h1fra reflected on how understanding Git internals revealed its elegant efficiency and broader applicability to any graph-structured data. The thread closed with lighthearted moments: sneela joking about "tvc-hub," TonyStr admitting the recursion of making Git commits while building tvc commits felt weird, and a quick fix to the website's missing title tag after heckelson's gentle nudge.

## [Is OpenAI Dead Yet?](https://isopenaideadyet.com/)
**Score:** 53 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46777448

> **Article:** The linked article "Is OpenAI Dead Yet?" appears to be a tracking/satirical website monitoring OpenAI's perceived decline, though no direct article content was provided in the discussion. Based on context, it likely documents negative news cycles, financial concerns, and competitive pressures facing OpenAI in 2025.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on whether OpenAI is in serious trouble and how investors might position around this risk. A retail investor asks about shorting OpenAI exposure through broad ETF holdings, with responses warning that shorting major tech (Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft) is dangerous—even "trains on fire" still crush opponents, as one commenter put it. Another likens hedging against OpenAI's collapse to "putting a towel on a pool-bed on the Titanic."

On OpenAI's competitive position, opinion is split. Some note they remain best-in-class for certain use cases, while others report superior results from Gemini, Claude Opus 4.5, or Kimi. The broader consensus acknowledges brutal commoditization: "No, they are not dead. However, they face incredible competition in a brutally commoditized product space."

A significant thread debates Chinese AI competition. One commenter argues Western assumptions about permanent US leadership mirror historical manufacturing arrogance—China progressed from "simple, bad stuff to highly complex things," and companies like Baidu and Alibaba now face scaling challenges few Western firms encounter. Others counter that Chinese pure-play AI startups show similarly dire financials to OpenAI, though tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent have far less systemic exposure due to sanctions limiting their capex.

The reliability of tech media draws criticism, with one commenter noting how DeepSeek R1 coverage in February 2025 prematurely declared Nvidia and OpenAI "dead." Another pushes back, arguing that "running out of data" and "hitting walls" narratives weren't wrong—synthetic data training and reinforcement learning became major precisely because traditional scaling slowed. This sparks a rebuttal: synthetic data has been used for years (Phi models, Llama 3), and Google DeepMind insists untapped data resources remain.

Underlying tensions persist: OpenAI's massive capex spending versus uncertain profitability, the difficulty of shorting a hype-driven market, and whether AI capabilities are converging globally or fragmenting into regional spheres where no single provider dominates.

## [US administration to require app, social media, possibly DNA for travelers](https://infosec.exchange/@briankrebs/115962508398912420)
**Score:** 50 | **Comments:** 20 | **ID:** 46774224

> **Article:** Brian Krebs reports that the US administration is planning to require travelers to provide extensive personal information including social media accounts, email addresses, mobile app usage data, and possibly DNA samples. The policy appears to target visa applicants and potentially travelers from visa-waiver countries, representing a significant expansion of surveillance and data collection at US borders.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with alarm and dark humor to this reported policy change. A central concern emerged around practical compliance: commenters using privacy tools like Mozilla Relay or Apple's HideMyEmail noted they accumulate hundreds or thousands of unique email addresses, making accurate disclosure essentially impossible. This fed into a broader suspicion that the policy is designed not for security but for selective enforcement—creating a pretext to deny entry to anyone authorities wish to target.

Several commenters drew mafia comparisons, with one noting the irony that joining organized crime historically required less personal information than visiting the US now might. Others pointed to the asymmetry of information: Palantir and intelligence agencies likely already possess much of this data, suggesting the disclosure requirement functions as a loyalty test rather than an information-gathering exercise. The risk of AI hallucinations and mistaken identity creating permanent travel bans without recourse was also raised.

Political dimensions surfaced quickly. Some noted that surveillance infrastructure persists across administrations, warning that tools deployed under one party get weaponized by the next. Others speculated about economic consequences, questioning how business groups like the Chamber of Commerce would respond, and whether major events like the 2026 World Cup might force policy retreat. A few commenters advocated outright boycott—protesting through reduced tourism and business travel.

The discussion reflected a community deeply skeptical of both the stated security rationale and the technical feasibility of compliance, seeing instead a mechanism for arbitrary authority expansion dressed in bureaucratic procedure.

## [TikTok removals up 150% following U.S. joint venture](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-uninstalls-are-up-150percent-following-us-joint-venture.html)
**Score:** 48 | **Comments:** 7 | **ID:** 46773808

> **Article:** A CNBC article reports that TikTok uninstalls have increased 150% following the establishment of a new U.S. joint venture for the platform. The new arrangement, which involved investors closing a deal with Chinese parent company ByteDance to run TikTok's U.S. operations, prompted an updated privacy policy. Key changes include expanding location data collection from "approximate" to "precise" location data depending on user settings. This has triggered a significant user exodus despite the app avoiding a ban.
>
> **Discussion:** Hacker News commenters offered varied perspectives on the uninstall surge. Several users expressed support for people leaving the platform, with one simply stating "it's for the best." However, others noted the irony that users were citing updated terms as their reason for quitting when those terms largely mirrored 2024 policies—suggesting many hadn't been paying close attention to data collection practices until the joint venture made headlines.

The discussion revealed sharp divides over surveillance concerns. One commenter provocatively framed the issue as Americans being more fearful of their own government's data collection than China's, given proximity and domestic enforcement power. Another echoed this, claiming they'd fear U.S. government retaliation for discussing sensitive topics like Epstein, arguing China "does not care" about such speech. This sentiment was reinforced by reports that TikTok's new U.S. entity is allegedly blocking references to Epstein and leftist content, with users reportedly migrating to alternative platforms like Skylight.

Technical workarounds were briefly explored, with one user wondering whether sideloading the international version might bypass U.S.-specific restrictions and server routing.

## [Ask HN: Books to learn 6502 ASM and the Apple II](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46778461)
**Score:** 41 | **Comments:** 20 | **ID:** 46778461

> **Question:** A Hacker News user with no prior programming experience asks for book recommendations to learn 6502 assembly language specifically for the Apple II platform. They explicitly prefer books over online tutorials, expressing skepticism about the quality of web-based learning resources.
>
> **Discussion:** The community responded with extensive book recommendations and thoughtful guidance about the learning path. Several commenters emphasized that the original poster's complete lack of programming experience makes this a challenging but achievable goal, with some debate about whether to start with BASIC first or dive directly into assembly.

The most frequently recommended resource was **"Assembly Lines: The Complete Book"** by Roger Wagner, available as a free PDF from ct6502.org, which collects all 33 of his Softalk magazine articles. Multiple users praised this as an ideal sit-down-and-work-through text specifically targeting the Apple II. For deeper hardware understanding, commenters pointed to **"Understanding the Apple II"** and **"Understanding the Apple IIe"** by Jim Sather, also freely available on Archive.org.

Rodnay Zaks' **"Programming the 6502"** received multiple endorsements as a classic foundational text, though the original poster correctly noted it doesn't cover Apple II-specific details like memory maps and screen management. Zaks' follow-up **"Advanced 6502 Programming"** was also recommended as a project-based tutorial. Other notable mentions included **"Machine Language for Beginners"** by Charles Mansfield for absolute beginners, Randy Hyde's book (creator of the Lisa assembler), and Ken Williams' Apple II graphics programming guide.

Several practical tools emerged from the discussion: the easy6502 emulator for hands-on practice, Ben Eater's 6502 kit for hardware understanding, and the wealth of digitized materials on Archive.org. One commenter suggested using AI coding assistants like Claude Code as a modern supplement.

The debate about prerequisites surfaced briefly—one user advocated starting with BASIC given the steep learning curve, while others argued that beginning with assembly on a simple architecture like the 6502 provides invaluable insight into how CPUs actually work, knowledge that higher-level languages obscure. The original poster remained firm in wanting books rather than tutorials, citing concerns about the practical programming abilities of developers trained primarily through online resources.

## [Why Intelligence Is a Terrible Proxy for Wisdom](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/why-intelligence-is-a-terrible-proxy-for-wisdom/)
**Score:** 26 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46774098

> **Article:** The article argues that intelligence and wisdom are fundamentally different qualities that are often conflated. Intelligence is characterized as the capacity for analytical processing, pattern recognition, and problem-solving—essentially raw cognitive horsepower. Wisdom, by contrast, involves judgment, perspective, emotional regulation, and the ability to navigate uncertainty and human complexity. The author contends that high intelligence can actually impede wisdom by fostering overconfidence, intellectual arrogance, and a tendency to overcomplicate or rationalize rather than accept practical truths. Intelligence without wisdom can lead to clever but harmful outcomes, as seen in brilliant people making poor life decisions or creating dangerous systems. The piece suggests wisdom develops through experience, reflection, and humility rather than through intellectual achievement alone.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion touches on several related themes without cohering around a single thread. metalman offers a mechanical metaphor suggesting that intense focus on certain cognitive modes—like cunning or self-interest—can cause "gear-locking" that prevents reaching sound conclusions, implying intelligence can become maladaptive when overtrained on narrow objectives. pinkmuffinere catches a likely factual error in the article's reference to Linus Pauling, noting the author probably meant Pauling was one of five people to win *any* Nobel Prize twice, not the Peace Prize specifically (which he won only once). ggm introduces Michael Crichton's "Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect—the tendency to trust media expertise on unfamiliar topics while recognizing its flaws in one's own domain—as a relevant cognitive bias, albeit with some discomfort about citing Crichton. Finally, SamarthaSR offers a simple, relatable endorsement that the article's message resonated personally. The overall tone is thoughtful but fragmented, with commenters bringing adjacent concepts rather than engaging directly with the article's thesis.

## [We Do Not Support Opt-Out Forms (2025)](https://consciousdigital.org/why-we-do-not-support-opt-out-forms/)
**Score:** 19 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46777641

> **Article:** The article from Conscious Digital explains why their organization refuses to support "opt-out" forms for data privacy. The core argument is that opt-out systems place an unfair burden on individuals to protect their own privacy, requiring constant vigilance and action to prevent data exploitation. They advocate instead for opt-in consent models and stronger regulatory frameworks that make data protection the default, not an exception that users must actively seek out.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was largely derailed by technical issues with the linked website, which appeared to be struggling under heavy load—ironically, from the very AI scrapers the article implicitly criticizes. Commenter drcongo noted the site wouldn't load and shared their own recent experience battling aggressive AI scraping from Baidu and OpenAI, describing thousands of requests per minute to non-existent URLs. This prompted a dry remark from jen729w about the "deterministic" nature of such scrapers. Other users provided archive.org and archive.ph mirrors to access the content. The meta-commentary about site availability and AI scraping ended up overshadowing substantive engagement with the article's privacy policy arguments.

## [Palantir Defends Work with ICE to Staff Following Killing of Alex Pretti](https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-ice-dhs-alex-pretti-killing-workers-slack-minneapolis/)
**Score:** 19 | **Comments:** 2 | **ID:** 46773791

> **Article:** Palantir CEO Alex Karp defended the company's work with ICE during an internal Slack meeting with employees following the killing of Alex Pretti, a man shot 10 times by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Karp reportedly argued that if Palantir's technology had been used—specifically what he called "Fully Autonomous System for Centralized Infrastructure and Surveillance Technology"—the system would have "calculated the correct score of Alex" and either prevented the killing or at least avoided the excessive use of 10 shots. The meeting appears to have been an attempt to address employee concerns about Palantir's controversial government contracts, particularly with immigration enforcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reflects deep cynicism about Palantir's defense of its ICE work. One commenter sarcastically summarizes Karp's position: that an autonomous system would have more "correctly" assessed and potentially killed Pretti with fewer bullets. Another commenter dismisses the need for any defense at all, arguing that Karp has been transparent in interviews about building technology designed to help kill people—comparing the situation to Ferrari being expected to defend itself after a speeding ticket. The core theme is that Palantir's leadership isn't hiding its purpose, making corporate "defenses" after violent incidents ring hollow to observers familiar with Karp's public statements.

**Score:** 19 | **Comments:** 1 | **ID:** 46778554

> **Article:** Bloomberg reports that Y Combinator has removed Canada from its list of approved countries for investment. The startup incubator, which has historically funded Canadian startups including notable successes like Dropbox and Reddit, has not publicly explained the decision. The move affects prospective Canadian founders who would now need to relocate to eligible countries to participate in YC's program. Canada had been a significant source of YC companies, with Canadian startups representing a meaningful portion of past batches.

## [Tesla brings Cybertruck to Middle East amid US demand collapse](https://electrek.co/2026/01/26/tesla-brings-cybertruck-to-middle-east-amid-us-demand-collapse/)
**Score:** 17 | **Comments:** 1 | **ID:** 46774334

> **Article:** Tesla is launching the Cybertruck in the Middle East (specifically Dubai and Abu Dhabi) as the company faces collapsing demand in the US market. The move comes after Tesla slashed prices on the Cybertruck by up to $20,000 following disappointing sales figures. The Middle East represents an attractive market because it allows the vehicle to be sold without the significant safety modifications required for European compliance, making it a lower-cost expansion option for Tesla.
>
> **Discussion:** The top comment from WheatMillington offers a critical perspective on Tesla's strategy, suggesting the company is exploiting markets with lax safety standards to offset the enormous development costs of what they characterize as a poorly designed vehicle. The commenter implies that the US itself has unusually permissive safety regulations compared to Europe, and that Tesla is now seeking out similarly unregulated markets rather than investing in proper compliance engineering. This framing portrays the Middle East expansion not as a positive business development but as a desperate maneuver to salvage a failing product that cannot meet stricter international standards.
