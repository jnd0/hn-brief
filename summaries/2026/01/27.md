## [France Aiming to Replace Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, etc.](https://twitter.com/lellouchenico/status/2015775970330882319)
**Score:** 796 | **Comments:** 689 | **ID:** 46767668

> **Article:** France is reportedly aiming to develop domestic alternatives to replace major US-based video conferencing and collaboration platforms including Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. The initiative appears to be part of broader European efforts to reduce technological dependence on American companies amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on whether Europe can realistically achieve digital sovereignty in communication tools and what this means for transatlantic tech relations.

**Market dynamics and American advantages**: softwaredoug argues that Americans often underestimate how their enormous homogeneous domestic market—plus the EU as an accessible second market—creates unmatched scale for tech companies. Alienating Europe could seriously constrain US tech growth, as no comparable third market exists with equivalent wealth, population, and English proficiency. Others like tick_tock_tick counter that the EU produces little software itself, leaving limited alternatives.

**Erosion of trust and long-term alliances**: A major thread explores whether Trump's policies represent a temporary aberration or permanent rupture. xp84 takes an optimistic view, predicting Trump's successors—whether Democrats or pro-growth Republicans—will reverse his most damaging policies. This draws sharp rebuttals: dleslie quotes "We will never fucking trust you again" as the prevailing sentiment among allies, while aucisson_masque notes Trump was elected twice with full knowledge of his character, suggesting similar leaders could follow. beloch adds that Canada specifically is actively seeking to reduce dependence on potentially "weaponized" US products.

**Paths to European tech independence**: jorvi proposes the most detailed alternative—a 5-20 year government-mandated transition to open source, starting with pilot municipalities and scaling up. This would redirect billions in Microsoft/Google/Amazon support contracts toward European open-source vendors like Collabora and SUSE. The challenge, as SirMaster notes, is mobile ecosystems: Android and iOS are deeply entrenched. omnimus suggests European politicians actually want to preserve tech revenue flows rather than truly disrupt the status quo.

**Infrastructure realities**: Commenters acknowledge that communication tools are relatively easier to replace than underlying cloud infrastructure. fcarraldo points to ScaleWay and OVH as existing European alternatives, though simonebrunozzi dismisses OVH as "subpar." The deeper vulnerability, per omnimus and kwanbix, is hardware—CPUs, GPUs, and manufacturing capacity. If the US restricts hardware exports to Europe as it does with China, software sovereignty becomes moot.

**Talent and economic tradeoffs**: idontwantthis wonders if the EU will recruit American engineers, prompting realistic assessments from the_sleaze_ and captain_coffee: European tech salaries run roughly 50% below US levels with high taxes, and French bureaucracy remains formidable despite visa incentives. eloisant counters that generous public services offset the tax burden, though Switzerland or Northern Europe better suit wealth maximization.

**How products actually win**: harikb and cmiles8 debate whether merit determines market success. Teams succeeded through bundling, not quality—suggesting EU alternatives could similarly leverage government procurement. Yet cmiles8 maintains that "good enough" with attractive value ultimately prevails, and decades of "drop the dominant apps" rhetoric have produced little change at scale. kibwen offers a darkly comic coda: anyone finding Teams "acceptable" may be experiencing Stockholm syndrome.

## [Television is 100 years old today](https://diamondgeezer.blogspot.com/2026/01/tv100.html)
**Score:** 617 | **Comments:** 233 | **ID:** 46766188

> **Article:** The linked article commemorates the 100th anniversary of television, marking January 26, 1926 as the date when John Logie Baird first demonstrated a working television system in London. The piece likely reflects on a century of television technology and culture, though the actual blog post content is not provided in the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion ranges widely across television's technical history, cultural impact, and contemporary relevance. Technically, commenters express fascination with CRT displays—described as "peak steampunk technology"—with particular attention to their analog nature, the synchronous oscillator-driven circuit connecting transmitter and receiver, and how images were never fully stored but existed only through persistence of vision. One correction notes that PAL systems actually did store single scanlines using delay lines. Safety hazards of early CRTs are mentioned, including catastrophic failure modes where electron guns could launch through screens.

The invention question sparks debate: Baird's 1926 mechanical system versus Philo Farnsworth's later electronic approach, with most modern television tracing to the latter—though one commenter disputes even this given today's LCD/OLED displays. A colorful detour covers early color TV's abandoned mechanical wheel system requiring massive rotating filters.

Personal memories thread through the discussion, including a remarkable Finnish recollection of 1957 Soviet Estonian broadcasts and childhood memory formation. Several commenters note they haven't owned traditional televisions for years, using only streaming devices or monitors. This prompts reflection on what was lost: the shared cultural experience of appointment television, when communities watched the same programs simultaneously and had common reference points. Some mourn this fragmentation; others who grew up without TV note that mass media always isolated non-participants, and today's Balkanized streaming landscape at least reduces the social penalty for opting out. The quality comparison between YouTube and 1980s broadcast television draws mixed assessments, with Sturgeon's Law invoked to suggest curation matters more than platform.

## [Fedora Asahi Remix is now working on Apple M3](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:okydh7e54e2nok65kjxdklvd/post/3mdd55paffk2o)
**Score:** 549 | **Comments:** 204 | **ID:** 46769051

> **Article:** Fedora Asahi Remix, the Linux distribution for Apple Silicon Macs, has announced working support for Apple M3 chips. The announcement came via a Bluesky post by Michael Reeves (not the YouTuber), a notably talented high schooler who has previously discovered numerous high-impact vulnerabilities in Apple software. This represents significant progress for the Asahi Linux project, which has been working to bring Linux to Apple Silicon Macs through reverse engineering efforts.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly branched into several interconnected themes. Many commenters expressed admiration for Michael Reeves' accomplishments as a high schooler, which sparked a melancholic reflection on how youthful curiosity in software engineering often gets "ground down by 9to5 corporate soul drain." This evolved into a broader debate about systemic barriers to innovation—one commenter shared how pre-ACA health insurance requirements forced them into wage slavery, and how universal healthcare or contribution-based UBI could unleash more intrinsic motivation in talented individuals. Others offered pragmatic advice about achieving financial freedom first before pursuing passion projects, warning against lifestyle inflation traps.

The technical discussion revealed why Apple Silicon Linux support lags so far behind new hardware releases. Unlike Intel and AMD, which contribute kernel changes proactively and maintain documentation, Apple provides no support and makes frequent undocumented changes—sometimes completely changing GPU instruction sets within a single generation. The M3 delay specifically was attributed more to the Asahi team paying down technical debt and upstreaming changes to the Linux kernel rather than M3 complexity itself. Looking forward, M4 support appears even more challenging due to new hardware-level page table protections. The conversation also touched on the tragic human cost of this work: the main developer reportedly faced a severe harassment campaign that contributed to their departure from the project.

Practical questions about Asahi's readiness yielded mixed assessments—usable for extending older hardware's lifespan, with DisplayPort and Thunderbolt support in testing, though ProMotion remains a notable gap. A side thread explored the eternal frustration of keyboard shortcuts, with Mac users migrating to Linux trading tips on remapping strategies through xkb and tools like Kinto.

## [Apple introduces new AirTag with longer range and improved findability](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-introduces-new-airtag-with-expanded-range-and-improved-findability/)
**Score:** 503 | **Comments:** 590 | **ID:** 46765819

> **Article:** Apple has introduced a new generation AirTag with expanded range and improved findability features. The device maintains its sub-$30 price point while incorporating significant environmental improvements: 85% recycled plastic in the enclosure, 100% recycled rare earth elements in magnets, and 100% recycled gold plating in circuit boards, plus fully fiber-based packaging. The new AirTag retains its familiar circular design and user-replaceable battery, with Apple continuing to emphasize its integration with the Find My network and Ultra Wideband technology for precise location tracking.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion around Apple's new AirTag reveals several interconnected themes spanning practical utility, law enforcement effectiveness, privacy trade-offs, and product design choices.

**Real-world recovery stories dominate the conversation**, with users sharing dramatically different experiences based on geography. A highly-upvoted account from Switzerland described a train theft resolved within 20 minutes through police cooperation and real-time AirTag tracking—prompting admiration for Swiss efficiency and unfavorable comparisons to American law enforcement. A contrasting story from Oakland, California illustrated the opposite extreme: police refused to act despite exact location data, citing warrant requirements, with a callback coming three days later. These anecdotes crystallized into broader observations about institutional effectiveness, with one commenter noting "Switzerland is the Singapore of Europe."

**The fundamental tension between theft prevention and anti-stalking protections** generated substantial debate. Multiple users noted that anti-stalking features—specifically alerts that trigger within 30-60 minutes when an unknown AirTag moves with someone—largely neutralize the device's value for recovering stolen property. This prompted the resigned observation that Apple is "damned if they do, damned if they don't," having faced criticism for insufficient protections before implementing these alerts. Some defended Apple's prioritization of personal safety over property recovery, while others pointed out that determined stalkers can bypass these protections through hardware modifications or custom-built trackers that rotate identifiers.

**Product design decisions drew both praise and satire**. Users celebrated the AirTag as "probably one of the best products Apple has made of late" for its affordability, user-replaceable battery, and reliable UX—particularly compared to Apple's increasingly inconsistent flagship offerings. However, the persistent absence of an integrated attachment point became a running joke, with one elaborate pseudo-technical explanation mocking Apple's design constraints through absurdist engineering jargon about "inverse-phase magnetic reluctance" and "fractal depleneration." Others defended this choice, noting that external attachments accommodate diverse use cases better than a one-size-fits-all solution.

**Environmental claims received skeptical scrutiny**, with some dismissing the recycled materials as "greenwashing" comparable to meaningless "natural ingredients" marketing, while others pressed for clarity on what recycling threshold would constitute genuine progress rather than performance.

**Practical limitations and alternatives** surfaced throughout: Android users remain second-class citizens in the Find My ecosystem; credit card-shaped third-party alternatives exist for wallet tracking; and some questioned whether dedicated tags were necessary at all when laptops, tablets, and headphones already offer similar functionality. A particularly poignant note came from a user whose AirTag-equipped grandmother with Alzheimer's appeared 50km away due to GPS jammers in Russian cities—reminding readers that even well-designed technology operates within broader infrastructural and political contexts beyond any single company's control.

## [Qwen3-Max-Thinking](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-max-thinking)
**Score:** 477 | **Comments:** 412 | **ID:** 46766741

> **Article:** Alibaba's Qwen team announced Qwen3-Max-Thinking, a new reasoning-focused large language model. The model is part of the Qwen3 family but is **not open-weight** (unlike many previous Qwen releases), making it available only through Alibaba Cloud's API services. The announcement highlights benchmark results positioning it competitively against Western frontier models, though specific technical details about architecture and training are limited in the linked announcement.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion around Qwen3-Max-Thinking quickly diverged into several contested territories. Most prominently, commenters immediately stress-tested the model for political censorship, with **lysace** reporting that asking "What happened on Tiananmen square in 1989?" triggered a "Content Security Warning" and connection error. This sparked a heated comparison with Western AI censorship—**calpaterson** argued American LLMs have "similar censorship issues, just on different material," while **criddell** challenged this equivalence. The debate intensified when **overfeed** cited ChatGPT's refusal to discuss Jonathan Turley (a law professor falsely implicated in a fabricated scandal by ChatGPT), which **lysace** rejected as categorically different: state erasure of historical atrocities versus a company's legal risk mitigation for individual defamation.

**jampekka** offered crucial nuance, noting that earlier Qwen models (like Qwen3-235B) actually discussed Tiananmen Square extensively when run locally outside China, suggesting the censorship may be **infrastructure-layer** rather than baked into model weights. This distinction between "safety system" and "model weights" became a recurring analytical frame.

On technical merits, **saberience** and **simonw** dismissed the popular "pelican on bicycle" SVG benchmark as "stupid" and economically irrelevant—frontier labs optimize for coding and tool-calling revenue, not visual novelty tasks. **roughly** and **Sol-** explored deeper economic questions: whether "better reasoning" represents genuine capability gains or simply "spend more to get more" through extended inference, with implications for AGI timelines and compute constraints.

The closed-weight status disappointed several commenters (**siliconc0w**, **tosh**, **throwaw12**), particularly those hoping for local alternatives to expensive API-only models like Claude Opus 4.5. **sidchilling** and others sought practical advice for resource-constrained coding workflows, with **oersted** offering a detailed subjective comparison: GPT-5.2 with high thinking slightly edges Qwen in quality/cost, while Opus 4.5's speed justifies its premium for practical use—despite HN's "obsession with Claude Code" possibly reflecting subscription-justification bias.

Pricing geography sparked interest: **isusmelj** noted Alibaba Cloud's significantly lower mainland China prices, which **QianXuesen** attributed to domestic AI price wars, government subsidies, and compute vouchers—structural advantages unavailable to international competitors.

Finally, **frankc** and **WarmWash** revived the distillation debate, arguing Chinese labs remain "compute constrained" and perpetually behind by training on Western model outputs. **syntaxing** countered that if Qwen3-Max-Thinking matches its benchmarks against Opus 4.5, it would mark an "inflection point" challenging the assumed 8+ month lag narrative—making this release a potential test case for whether algorithmic efficiency can overcome capital disadvantages.

## [Google AI Overviews cite YouTube more than any medical site for health queries](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/24/google-ai-overviews-youtube-medical-citations-study)
**Score:** 392 | **Comments:** 203 | **ID:** 46766031

> **Article:** A Guardian article reports on a study finding that Google's AI Overviews feature cites YouTube more frequently than any medical website when answering health-related queries. The research, conducted by a SERP ranking analysis company, found that YouTube was the top-cited domain for health questions, ahead of established medical sources like Mayo Clinic, WebMD, or CDC. However, the researchers later walked back some claims, noting that most YouTube videos cited (24 of 25 analyzed) came from legitimate medical channels like hospitals and health organizations, with 21 clearly noting licensed or trusted sources—though this represented less than 1% of all YouTube links cited.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism about Google's AI Overviews, with concerns falling into several interconnected themes.

**The "Closed Loop" Problem of AI-Generated Sources**
Multiple commenters highlight a disturbing pattern where Gemini cites AI-generated videos as primary sources, creating a self-referential information ecosystem. One heavy Gemini user describes finding an AI-generated video attached to a response about Russian military capabilities, causing their trust in the system to plummet. This "debasement of shared reality"—where synthetic content feeds back into AI training and citations—emerges as a core anxiety, with some invoking the "dead internet theory" about AI-generated content overwhelming authentic human creation.

**User Control vs. Platform Behavior**
Several users express frustration that Gemini ignores explicit instructions. One commenter maintains permanent settings telling it "never ever" to include videos, yet it consistently does. This prompts a broader debate about information formats: some defend video as exploiting multiple cognitive channels and serving novices better than text, while others counter that reading is 2-4x faster, searchable, and less susceptible to persuasive vocal manipulation. The practical complaint that code requests generate unwanted "prose" alongside the actual code illustrates how AI systems optimize for their own output patterns rather than user specifications.

**The Credibility Paradox**
Commenters note the fundamental tension in AI medical information. A surgeon's relative notes that practicing doctors legitimately use YouTube for surgical videos—suggesting the platform isn't inherently worthless. Yet the general public lacks the expertise to evaluate what they see. This creates a dangerous asymmetry: professionals can spot dangerous techniques quickly, while laypeople may be persuaded by confident presentation into self-diagnosis or harmful "one quick trick" alternatives to proven treatments. Several describe patients arriving at clinics with parasocial relationships to medical influencers, convinced by hours of content that contradicts clinical evaluation.

**Institutional Failure and User Retention**
Some express bafflement that Google—whose identity centers on "Search"—shipped a product so prone to hallucination and misattribution. One commenter describes clicking AI-cited sources only to find the claimed verbatim quotes don't exist, wondering "if the AI just made it up completely." The obvious question—why remain a heavy user despite these flaws?—gets answered implicitly: the problems are "down the road," not immediately apparent enough to drive mass abandonment, even as trust erodes. The cycle of usage despite dysfunction suggests market incentives may not correct these issues quickly.

**Platform Self-Preference**
A quieter thread notes this as expected behavior: of course Google privileges its own properties. The surprise isn't the bias but the apparent lack of quality control within it—citing YouTube isn't inherently wrong, but doing so without verifying whether sources are AI slop, entertainment disguised as education, or legitimate medical content undermines the entire value proposition of "overview" as trustworthy synthesis.

## [ChatGPT Containers can now run bash, pip/npm install packages and download files](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/26/chatgpt-containers/)
**Score:** 369 | **Comments:** 268 | **ID:** 46770221

> **Article:** Simon Willison reports on a new ChatGPT feature: containers that can run bash, install packages via pip/npm, and download files. The containers appear to run on Debian with 4GB RAM and report 56 CPU cores (though likely shared/throttled). This enables more complex agentic workflows where ChatGPT can execute arbitrary code, compile software, and persist files across a session. Willison notes this is available on paid accounts ($20/month) with free accounts hitting upgrade prompts after minimal usage.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion spiraled into several distinct threads. The most prominent debate centered on a provocative claim that "most code is written by LLMs now," with commenters split between skepticism and endorsement. Critics like koe123 dismissed this as Truman Show delusion, noting AI generates perhaps 1% of their production code; defenders like cheeze (from FAANG) estimated 20%+ LLM-written code on their team, mostly boilerplate and tests. fooker countered that by line count, LLM output dominates by an order of magnitude, even if much is "janky garbage."

This fed into a broader speculation about programming language futures. behnamoh argued dynamic languages' advantage (developer speed) erodes when LLMs write code, making compiled languages like Go attractive again for their portability and fast compilation. Others pushed back: physicsguy noted dependencies like NumPy involve deep numerical correctness that LLMs shouldn't regenerate; jmacd wondered if dependencies even make sense when LLMs can generate functionality directly.

Practical container capabilities drew technical interest. simonw confirmed Claude Code already offers persistent virtual dev environments, and users speculated on cloud-hosted development futures—yoyohello13 dreaded thin-client dependency, while candiddevmike saw platform lock-in strategies emerging. dangoodmanUT highlighted compounding benefits: agents with Linux access can debug weird failures (like misnamed image formats) through iterative inspection, though lpcvoid and ndsipa_pomu noted such tasks are trivial for humans with standard Unix tools.

The thread also attracted geopolitical derailment. wartywhoa23's lengthy reflection on Russian propaganda and fascism's rise—prompted by tgq2915's flagged comment—drew responses about whether wars emerge suddenly or through gradual processes, with PurpleRamen arguing most conflicts follow long-predictable trajectories.

## [JuiceSSH – Give me my pro features back](https://nproject.io/blog/juicessh-give-me-back-my-pro-features/)
**Score:** 356 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46768909

> **Article:** The article discusses how JuiceSSH, a popular Android SSH client, has stopped recognizing Pro purchases made by users years ago. The author, who bought Pro features in 2019 for €4.99, found that the app no longer acknowledges this purchase and demands payment again (now €29.99). The developer has been unresponsive to support emails. The article provides technical instructions for bypassing the Pro check using APK patching tools, effectively "pirating" the features users already paid for. The author frames this as a legitimate response to being denied access to already-purchased functionality.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals significant frustration among long-time JuiceSSH users, many of whom report similar experiences of lost Pro purchases and unresponsive developers. Several users discovered they had paid twice for the same features after being locked out, with Google Play refund requests frequently denied due to 120-day policy limits—though some suggested credit card chargebacks as an alternative.

The conversation quickly turned to alternatives, with **Termux** emerging as the dominant recommendation. Users praised it as a full Linux environment with SSH, rsync, and editor capabilities, though some noted the learning curve and GUI tradeoffs. A newer option—the Android 15 Terminal app (a Debian VM)—was mentioned but limited by hardware compatibility issues on Snapdragon chips.

Security concerns arose when users realized JuiceSSH's cloud key backup feature had silently disappeared, prompting urgent advice to rotate potentially exposed SSH keys. Debates ensued about proper key management, with some arguing keys should never leave their creation device while others discussed encryption and certificate-based alternatives.

Opinion was divided on whether this constituted a "rug pull." Some defended the developer, noting JuiceSSH's 14-year history and previous periods of silence followed by renewed activity, suggesting backend server failures rather than intentional scamming. Others countered that unilaterally revoking permanent purchases—regardless of intent—fits the definition. A minority criticized the article's patching approach as encouraging piracy, though most sympathized given the circumstances.

## [Windows 11's Patch Tuesday nightmare gets worse](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11s-botched-patch-tuesday-update-nightmare-continues-as-microsoft-confirms-some-pcs-might-fail-to-boot)
**Score:** 346 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46766526

> **Article:** Microsoft confirmed that January's Patch Tuesday update for Windows 11 (KB5050009) is causing serious issues including boot failures on some PCs, with users reporting blue screens, performance degradation, and update installation problems. This follows a pattern of problematic Windows updates, with the article noting this may represent the lowest quality bar for Windows updates in the operating system's history.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on why Windows quality has deteriorated so dramatically, with commenters debating the root causes and expressing frustration with Microsoft's direction.

**LLMs vs. Long-term Cultural Decline**

A prominent thread opened with rossdavidh observing that Microsoft was an early adopter of LLM-assisted coding, yet Windows quality has visibly declined—suggesting either LLMs don't deliver promised productivity gains or Microsoft isn't actually using them for critical systems. This sparked pushback from Someone1234, who argued the real culprit predates LLMs: Microsoft's 2014 decision to eliminate dedicated QA teams as a cost-cutting measure, shifting testing responsibilities to developers themselves. This "engineers to MBA-led company" transition represents a deeper cultural rot prioritizing short-term shareholder value over long-term reputation.

mancerayder challenged this narrative, citing the original Ars Technica reporting that showed QA ratios merely shifted from 2:1 to 1:1 testers-to-developers rather than wholesale elimination. However, debugnik countered that whatever the 2014 baseline, the *timing* of increasingly broken patches aligns with recent deterioration, not the original restructuring.

**The "What Could Have Been" Frustration**

adamrezich articulated a poignant alternate-reality scenario: imagine if Copilot integration actually delivered on its promises, with Windows demonstrably improving release-over-release. The gap between this hypothetical and reality—where AI hype coincides with visible decline—makes the current situation feel particularly insulting to users.

**Structural Explanations**

Multiple commenters analyzed why Microsoft tolerates this. pjc50 noted the lack of realistic competition for business ecosystems removes quality pressure. eviks pointed to revenue data showing Windows at only ~10% of Microsoft revenue versus 40% for servers and 22% for Office, suggesting strategic neglect. Conversely, dangus argued competition is actually fiercer than decades, with Apple Silicon gains and viable Linux alternatives emerging. OkayPhysicist took the strongest stance: Windows and Office are Microsoft's only relevance-generating products; everything else piggybacks on that ecosystem lock-in, making Windows quality existential despite its direct revenue contribution.

**User Experience Divergence**

Amid the criticism, timpera offered a minority positive view, praising Windows 11's multitasking, ARM64 battery life, USB-C reliability, and PowerToys—while acknowledging Microsoft "destroy[s] its reputation by pushing Copilot and bugs." This prompted bayesnet's genuine curiosity about redeeming qualities, with timpera citing specific workflow improvements. zipy124 pushed back that reliability problems persist, just manifesting as "inoperable states" rather than crashes.

**Specific Technical Grievances**

CWuestefeld detailed concrete breakage: Playnite and desktop icons failing due to Windows Shell/OneDrive interaction bugs, with the latter unfixable. This fed into broader subscription-service skepticism, with rdiddly endorsing SyncThing over OneDrive. ferguess_k invoked David Cutler's legendary engineering discipline as what's missing, while CWuestefeld questioned why Windows leadership retains employment given updates that actively undermine Microsoft's own subscription strategy.

The discussion ultimately portrays a company caught between AI hype investment and deteriorating core competency, with structural incentives and cultural shifts making course correction unlikely despite mounting user frustration.

## [Kimi Released Kimi K2.5, Open-Source Visual SOTA-Agentic Model](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html)
**Score:** 307 | **Comments:** 115 | **ID:** 46775961

> **Article:** Moonshot AI's Kimi K2.5 is a new open-source large language model featuring 1 trillion total parameters with 32 billion active parameters (MoE architecture), released under a modified MIT license. It achieves state-of-the-art results on visual and agentic benchmarks, including cracking the 50th percentile on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). The model supports "agent swarms" — up to 100 parallel sub-agents executing 1,500+ tool calls for complex tasks, reportedly reducing end-to-end runtime by 80%. The license requires prominent display of "Kimi K2.5" for commercial products exceeding 100 million MAU or $20 million monthly revenue.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on three main themes: hardware feasibility, business strategy, and technical architecture.

**Hardware and Deployment Reality**
Commenters immediately grappled with the model's staggering scale. At 1T parameters, even int4 quantization demands ~500GB VRAM, placing it far beyond consumer reach. Barathkanna outlined a realistic production setup: 16× H100 80GB with NVLink (~$500K–$700K), while bertili provocatively suggested two Mac Studios with Thunderbolt 5 RDMA (~$20K) for smaller private deployments. This sparked technical debate — Barathkanna countered that MoE routing requires the full expert set resident for fast switching, making Mac Studios impractical due to bandwidth limitations, though johndough and bertili noted the LocalLLaMA community's progress running similar models via SSD streaming or distributed setups. API pricing via OpenRouter was reported around $0.50/1M input and $2.50/1M output tokens.

**Licensing and Business Model**
The modified MIT license drew skepticism. dheera questioned why Moonshot didn't simply demand payment rather than UI attribution for large users, while others interpreted this as a "Google search widget" play for brand recognition. Multiple commenters puzzled over the economics of releasing such expensive-to-train models freely. Explanations ranged from Chinese state strategy to undermine US AI dominance (whizzter), to a two-sided market where open-sourcing drives API usage and mindshare against closed competitors like OpenAI (Balinares), to the now-familiar pattern established by DeepSeek one year prior (bertili). The timing — just before Chinese New Year — was noted as characteristic of Chinese tech releases.

**Agent Swarms and MoE Architecture**
The "agent swarm" capability generated both enthusiasm and clarification. pu_pe asked for explanation of the concept; rvnx and vessenes described it as parallel specialized workers orchestrated by a "team lead" LLM, with vessenes connecting it to established patterns like "Gas town" and Claude's swarm mode. jumploops highlighted that K2.5 uses RL not just for tool calling but for agent orchestration itself. XCSme questioned whether this was intrinsic to the model or an external service, suggesting it might differ little from parallel API calls except for the LLM-driven task decomposition.

The discussion reflects broader tensions in AI: open vs. closed models, the democratization of capabilities versus concentration of practical access, and whether agent architectures represent genuine paradigm shifts or incremental engineering on existing patterns.

## [There is an AI code review bubble](https://www.greptile.com/blog/ai-code-review-bubble)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 198 | **ID:** 46766961

> **Article:** The article argues that the current wave of AI-powered code review tools represents a speculative bubble. The author, from Greptile (an AI code review company), contends that most existing tools are essentially wrappers around LLM APIs with limited differentiation, poor contextual understanding, and unsustainable business models. The piece suggests that true value in this space requires moving beyond superficial linting-style feedback toward deeper code comprehension, and that many current market entrants will not survive as foundation models improve and potentially subsume their functionality.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep skepticism about AI code review tools, with several recurring themes emerging. The most prominent critique centers on **signal-to-noise ratio**: multiple commenters, including zmmmmm and Quarrelsome, note that while AI tools can catch genuine bugs—zmmmm estimates around 80% of critical issues in their experience—they drown these in voluminous speculative or stylistic complaints. This mirrors a frustration many have with human reviewers who fixate on naming conventions while missing functional problems. Quarrelsome suggests this filtering ability represents a genuinely hard problem; if solved, it could automate one of the last supposedly "safe" domains for developers.

Several participants distinguish AI reviews from traditional static analysis. materialpoint draws a parallel to CodeQL and SonarQube, criticizing how rigid rules often force counterproductive "perfections" that ignore developer intent. shagie offers a counterpoint, sharing concrete examples where AI caught subtle bugs—duplicate method calls and redundant filters across call boundaries—that linters missed. dakshgupta, representing Greptile, pushes back against the linter comparison, citing 9,000+ "great catch" responses in a week as evidence of genuine utility, though tadfisher cautions this raw figure lacks denominators for proper evaluation.

The **context problem** surfaces repeatedly. candiddevmike argues current tools lack sufficient context for meaningful review, while shagie notes AI fusses over conventions it cannot know. realusername shares a failure mode where AI flagged necessary repeated calls because it misunderstood stateful behavior. This connects to cmrdporcupine's extended critique: they explicitly reject Greptile's vision of "vanishingly little human participation," arguing the real danger is engineers producing code they don't understand. They seek tools that force *more* knowledge acquisition, not less—contrasting with "way too eager" agentic tools like Claude Code. jacobegold notes their company Graphite is pursuing this alternative direction.

Business model anxieties appear near the end. raincole voices the "Dropbox is just FTP" concern—that any good idea will be copied by OpenAI or Anthropic. sthuck acknowledges this tension: fine-tuning and integration work provides value, but model improvements erode differentiation while LLMs enable competitors to replicate features quickly. allreduce suggests asking Claude directly for reviews, then filtering through humans, undercuts the commercial case entirely.

A smaller thread explores review culture itself. zenolijo defends naming comments as valuable for collaborative codebases, while Quarrelsome offers the absurdist example of four senior engineers spending thirty minutes debating `itemCount` versus `numberOfItems`. daotoad proposes criteria for genuinely useful naming feedback (violating standards, inconsistency, conflated concepts) versus bike-shedding. eieio describes a preferred workflow where reviewers directly edit minor issues rather than commenting, reserving comments for substantive discussion—though they admit not trusting AI taste for such judgments yet.

## [RIP Low-Code 2014-2025](https://www.zackliscio.com/posts/rip-low-code-2014-2025/)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46767440

> **Article:** The article "RIP Low-Code 2014-2025" argues that low-code platforms are becoming obsolete due to the rise of LLMs. The core thesis is that as AI code generation improves, the trade-offs of low-code platforms (vendor lock-in, limited flexibility, constrained expressiveness) no longer make sense when developers can simply generate traditional code faster. The author suggests that the "cost of shipping code now approaches zero" with AI assistance, eliminating the primary value proposition of visual, constrained development environments.

## [When AI 'builds a browser,' check the repo before believing the hype](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/26/cursor_opinion/)
**Score:** 221 | **Comments:** 132 | **ID:** 46769965

> **Article:** The Register article critiques Cursor's recent demonstration of building a "browser from scratch" using AI agents running for a week, generating 3+ million lines of code. The piece argues this was misleading hype: the "browser" was largely a poorly-designed wrapper around Servo (Mozilla's existing Rust browser engine), with the AI producing "uniquely bad design" that couldn't support a real web engine. The author warns against taking AI coding demos at face value without examining the actual repository.

## [Dithering – Part 2: The Ordered Dithering](https://visualrambling.space/dithering-part-2/)
**Score:** 219 | **Comments:** 27 | **ID:** 46770274

> **Article:** This is the second installment in a visual series on dithering algorithms, focusing specifically on ordered dithering (also known as Bayer dithering or matrix dithering). The article explores how ordered dithering works by applying a fixed threshold matrix pattern to an image, comparing it to error diffusion methods. The presentation emphasizes visual demonstrations with a distinctive, well-crafted page design that showcases the algorithms in action. The author promises a future installment on error diffusion techniques.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals a vibrant community of practitioners working with dithering across diverse applications. Several commenters shared their own projects: PMunch detailed his deep dive into dithering for an e-paper laptop build, comparing error diffusion, Bayer, blue noise, and novel approaches; ggambetta described using ordered dithering in a ZX Spectrum raytracer constrained by 8×8 pixel color blocks; and mblode promoted his open-source blue noise generator library in Rust and TypeScript.

Practical constraints emerged as a major theme. Storystarling noted that physical ink bleed in print-on-demand makes error diffusion "muddy" while ordered dithering handles dot gain better—echoed by robinsonb5's observation about traditional litho printing using clustered dot screens. This sparked an interesting parallel to 1-bit audio output, where pulse width modulation (like printer dot screens) proves more robust than pulse density modulation (like error diffusion).

Technical comparisons dominated the latter half. Quag advocated for quasi-random sequences over blue noise and modern "three line" game approaches, linking to research on their unreasonable effectiveness. Leguminous pushed back, noting excellent results from 64×64 blue noise textures on GPUs and questioning whether quasirandom sequences offered advantages in speed or quality—especially without temporal anti-aliasing. They shared ShaderToy experiments attempting to add temporal components to R2 sequences.

Historical and nostalgic applications drew attention too: a_shovel connected Bayer dithering to Flipnote Studio animations, while spicyjpeg provided a detailed technical breakdown of how the original PlayStation used hardcoded 4×4 Bayer matrices to mask 16-bit color banding—intended to blur away on period-accurate CRTs via composite video, now conspicuously visible on modern displays.

The presentation itself garnered mixed reactions. Treavorpasan offered effusive praise comparing the work to Michelangelo, while others like ginko found the bite-sized pacing "disrespectful." Fraterkes criticized the thread's self-promotional tone, countered by jasonjmcghee's defense that shared passion naturally leads to project sharing. Subprotocol noted a Chrome loading bug that Firefox avoided. Several commenters simply expressed anticipation for the error diffusion follow-up.

## [Google Books removed all search functions for any books with previews](https://old.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1qn1hk1/google_has_seemingly_entirely_removed_search/)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 67 | **ID:** 46769201

> **Article:** Google Books has reportedly removed or severely degraded search functionality for books with previews, with users noticing a dramatic change around January 21, 2025. Previously, users could search across the full text of preview-enabled books to find relevant passages; now, search results for such books have become significantly less useful, effectively requiring users to already know which specific book they want before accessing preview content. Public domain books remain fully searchable. The change appears to specifically affect modern, copyrighted works that have preview agreements with publishers.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion revolves around competing theories for why Google made this change and broader reflections on information access in the AI era.

Most participants suspect AI-related motivations. Several argue Google is restricting valuable training data from competitors, with one noting this mirrors how Google blocked ChatGPT from summarizing YouTube videos while allowing its own Gemini to do so. Others suggest publishers demanded these restrictions due to concerns about AI training, or that Google detected scraping and implemented this as a preventive measure. One participant provocatively suggests human-generated data has become as valuable as pre-nuclear steel, making Google protective of its corpus.

A significant thread examines apparent contradictions in the community's stance on piracy and information freedom. One user notes the shift from "information wants to be free" ideals toward protective attitudes regarding AI training data, wondering whether people have genuinely changed views or if different voices now dominate the conversation. A self-described "pirate" responds with a nuanced position: they support broad access for individuals but argue that if companies use pirated material to train commercial LLMs, those models should be free and open source—a stance that would "wreck every corporate LLM strategy."

Alternative explanations include contractual pressure from publishers (who grant preview rights and could threaten complete removal) and technical changes, though participants dispute whether cost-cutting or vector search replacement explains the degradation. Some note the search function still exists but requires knowing the target book in advance, fundamentally altering the discovery use case.

The discussion also touches on copyright reform, with several participants blaming excessive term lengths (70 years after death, 95 years after publication) for creating these access problems. One highlights the absurdity of Metropolis remaining under copyright in Germany until 2047—120 years after release. Others recommend piracy alternatives like Library Genesis, Anna's Archive, Sci-Hub, and Z-Library, though these lack the full-text search capability Google Books previously provided.

Several users confirm the degradation through before/after screenshots and personal testing, while one notes public domain content remains unaffected, suggesting the issue specifically concerns publisher agreements around copyrighted material.

## [The Adolescence of Technology](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46768257

> **Article:** Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic) writes about AI's "adolescence"—the period where AI capabilities are rapidly maturing but society remains unprepared for the transition to transformative AI. Drawing on Sagan's "adolescence of humanity" framing, he argues we're in a critical window where AI is powerful enough to cause serious disruption but not yet powerful enough to solve the coordination problems it creates. The essay explores the tension between near-term concerns (misuse, economic disruption, societal adaptation) and long-term concerns (existential risk, the "alignment problem"), arguing these are more interconnected than often assumed. Amodei suggests we need both technical safety work and societal preparation, emphasizing that the next few years may determine whether AI development leads to broadly positive or catastrophic outcomes.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals deep uncertainty about how to engage with AI's trajectory. **Lerc** opens with cultural anxiety—that science fiction once provided shared vocabulary for AI risks (Asimov, Sagan), but this knowledge seems forgotten or corrupted by the time it matters, leaving society "wilfully" unprepared and unable to even discuss desired futures without derision. **Nemomarx** echoes this helplessness, noting how competitive dynamics (alignment researchers racing to deploy, engineers fearing obsolescence) prevent anyone from actually steering outcomes, reducing individuals to passive observers.

**Cheschire** offers a technical-historical angle: Asimov assumed we'd understand AI deeply before building it, but modern ML emerged from "YOLO-dumping" data into optimization problems—making his rule-based safeguards irrelevant. This connects to **Firasd's** concrete critique of Anthropic's models, sharing an almost slapstick interaction where Claude mechanically permutes failed solutions rather than reasoning about why they fail (comparing it to a horror movie character walking into obvious danger). Firasd suggests this "Just do it" behavior stems from RLHF training, implying current "intelligence" may be narrower and more brittle than it appears—raising questions about whether Amodei's concerns are extrapolating too far from web-coding performance.

**Root_axis** pushes back on disruption fears, arguing LLM impacts remain incremental outside software, and even there produce "the same CRUD, faster" rather than transformation. **Jonas21** counters that software looked similarly limited just a year ago, asking why other knowledge fields won't follow the same rapid progression. **Cubefox** closes by noting this misses Amodei's core argument: the essay concerns future superhuman AI, not current capabilities, and the absence of existential risk today doesn't warrant complacency about the trajectory.

## [AI code and software craft](https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2026-01-25-slop.html)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46769188

> **Article:** The linked article (from alexwennerberg.com, dated 2026-01-25 with the slug "slop") explores the tension between AI-generated code and traditional software craftsmanship. The author appears to examine concerns about "slop"—low-quality, mass-produced AI output—and how it relates to broader questions of human agency, quality, and the nature of skilled work in software development. The title and framing suggest a meditation on whether efficiency-driven AI coding tools undermine the apprenticeship-like learning and care that traditionally characterized software engineering.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on whether AI coding represents a familiar technological transition (like power tools replacing hand tools) or something more fundamentally damaging to software quality and craft.

**The Luddite comparison and its limits**
Herring opens by framing the debate as a recurrence of the 19th-century Luddite-versus-Industrialist conflict: one side prizing human agency and apprenticeship, the other prizing efficiency. However, multiple commenters challenge this parallel. convolvatron argues it's different because prior industrial transitions (weaving, CNC machining) maintained or improved quality while reducing labor, whereas current AI code is "objectively much worse." fwip and gbear605 push back even on this historical claim, noting that industrial cloth quality did in fact diminish—though it became vastly cheaper and more accessible.

**Quality concerns and the "orchestration" response**
will__ness acknowledges AI coding agents have serious limitations (hallucination, poor understanding, bad code) but suggests high-quality output remains possible through careful human orchestration—planning, validating, reviewing—comparing the shift to moving from handsaw to chainsaw. This draws skepticism: acedTrex counters that in practice, LLM code is "orders of magnitude worse" than hand-written equivalents, not equivalent; nielsbot notes that for many tasks, simply writing the code oneself is faster than managing this orchestration.

**The fate of craftsmanship**
slotrans offers a dark prediction: AI won't free engineers for higher craft but will "annihilate the last vestiges of craftsmanship forever." 0xbadcafebee resists this doom, citing persistent niches for hand-tool woodworking, hand knitting, and blacksmithing—crafts that survived industrialization. hackyhacky counters that these examples prove the point: such crafts became economically nonviable, relegated to "niche, exotic, or hobbyist areas," and coding will follow. Ronsenshi questions the sustainability of this trajectory: if hand-coding disappears, who improves the AI models or tackles novel problems?

**Practical and economic realities**
Several threads touch on where AI coding fits practically. skybrian distinguishes between "delicate" code requiring human care and robust, well-tested projects (especially web apps) where AI assistance becomes as obvious a choice as snowplows over shovels. SchemaLoad and ozim explore why enterprise software is often poor quality regardless of AI—manager-driven requirements, misaligned incentives, and fragmented customer demands create complexity that AI may compound rather than solve.

trollbridge questions whether software can ever be fully industrialized given its inherent complexity, while fartfeatures defends AI coding's utility despite imperfections, comparing it to transportation modes that extend human capability even when imperfect. The discussion ultimately circles an unresolved tension: whether AI coding tools will mature into genuine amplifiers of human judgment, or whether economic pressures will flood software with adequate-but-degraded output, displacing the knowledge required to recognize or repair the difference.

## [Celebrities say they are being censored by TikTok after speaking out against ICE](https://www.pride.com/culture/celebrities/tiktok-censoring-megan-stalter-and-finneas)
**Score:** 199 | **Comments:** 163 | **ID:** 46777652

> **Article:** The Pride.com article reports that celebrities including Megan Stalter and Finneas (Billie Eilish's brother) are claiming TikTok is suppressing their content after they posted videos criticizing ICE and immigration enforcement. The celebrities noticed significant drops in viewership and engagement on their posts speaking out against immigration policies, suggesting algorithmic throttling or shadowbanning. This comes after TikTok's ownership transition to a US-based entity led by Oracle's Larry Ellison, following the Supreme Court's decision upholding the law requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a US ban.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion quickly polarized around several interconnected debates. A significant portion centered on whether celebrity activism constitutes "virtue signaling"—with gadders dismissing it as such, and others like gambiting pushing back that labeling anti-ICE speech this way trivializes genuine opposition to what they view as escalating authoritarianism. Jesseendahl defended Finneas specifically as authentic rather than performative.

This spiraled into a heated definitional argument about fascism. Joe_mamba claimed that true fascism would immediately execute dissenters, making the "fascism" label hyperbolic. Others forcefully countered: chimprich cited masked federal paramilitaries operating without identification, attacking protesters, and facing no accountability; rsynnott corrected the historical record, noting Nazi Germany had a gradual consolidation period with public criticism still possible through 1933-34 and even discontent after Kristallnacht in 1938.

The TikTok ownership change drew sharp criticism, particularly targeting Larry Ellison and Oracle. Jauntywundrkind framed this as the beginning of systematic "censorship and algorithmic biasing for the right wing ultra capitalist agenda," linking the Supreme Court's unanimous decision to broader government-corporate collusion. This triggered a side debate about capitalism itself—0x3f mocked the framing, while scotty79 offered a power-centric definition where capital systematically overrules other concerns.

Several commenters analyzed the mechanics of content suppression. Baxtr cautioned that algorithmic opacity makes causation hard to prove; scotty79 found suppression unlikely given ICE's unpopularity; mrtksn referenced TikTok folklore about keyword tricks resetting algorithms, suggesting users already suspect manipulation. Libertine emphasized that celebrities' reach makes them canaries in the coal mine—if they're throttled, ordinary users face worse.

The discussion's meta-dynamics became contentious. Iceflinger questioned why the post was flagged; dudefeliciano and saubeidl attributed this to pro-government users avoiding engagement while suppressing visibility, with saubeidl explicitly calling this behavior "proto-fascist." Xtracto expressed frustration that HN political threads devolve into Reddit-style emotionalism rather than constructive technical solutions (contrasting with Iran censorship discussions). Thunky lamented the absence of genuine cross-ideological dialogue, blaming downvote misuse for creating echo chambers.

International and legal perspectives appeared sporadically: rvnx suggested using Chinese Douyin instead; saubeidl and defrost sparred over First Amendment applicability to private platforms; 0xy accused Biden's DOJ of similar censorship collusion. Rsynnott and filoeleven closed with practical observations about platform migration and network effects, with vanviegen challenging whether any major platform could resist US government pressure.

## [Y Combinator website no longer lists Canada as a country it invests in](https://betakit.com/y-combinator-website-no-longer-lists-canada-as-a-country-it-invests-in/)
**Score:** 198 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46773242

> **Article:** Y Combinator has removed Canada from the short list of countries where it directly invests in locally incorporated companies. The list previously included US, Cayman Islands, Singapore, and Canada; it now only lists US, Cayman Islands, and Singapore. Canadian founders can still participate in YC, but must now incorporate in one of those three jurisdictions—similar to founders from Europe, Asia, and other regions. This ends Canada's special status as an exception to YC's standard requirement for US-style corporate structures.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely debunked the article's framing as misleading, with multiple commenters clarifying that YC still backs Canadian founders—just not Canadian-domiciled entities. The key context, provided by tptacek and others, is that Canada had been an unusual exception to YC's general policy of requiring flipped corporate structures for international investments. The change aligns Canada with how YC already treats 386 European companies, 218 South Asian companies, and hundreds of others worldwide.

Several threads explored why this operational shift might have happened. Tptacek, drawing on experience as a global employer, emphasized the administrative burden of managing investment stakes across multiple jurisdictions. Others speculated about specific pain points with Canadian corporate structures, though no definitive cause was identified.

The conversation evolved into broader critiques of Canada's startup ecosystem. Some commenters praised Canada's investor-friendliness, government incentives, and talent pools in cities like Calgary, Toronto, and Vancouver—particularly for machine learning. Others painted a bleaker picture: excessive regulation, protected oligopolies in banking/telecom/aviation, limited domestic VC capacity, and a "Valley-or-bust" mentality that pushes successful companies south. The scarcity of Canadian institutional capital was noted—pension funds like OTPP and CDPQ prioritize higher-return markets abroad despite some home bias.

A revealing subthread contrasted Canada with Israel, China, and India, which built vibrant VC ecosystems through government-backed funds-of-funds despite smaller domestic markets. Several commenters argued Canada's problem isn't market size but vision and risk appetite among decision-makers.

The discussion also touched on practical realities: Canadian wages and total compensation lag US levels significantly, though this is offset by healthcare coverage (partially—commenters corrected the misconception that Canada has no private health benefits) and livability. One US developer's comment about seeking Canadian citizenship for political reasons sparked predictable debate about whether Canada could truly insulate itself from American instability.

## [A list of fun destinations for telnet](https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm)
**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46775135

> **Article:** A curated list of active telnet destinations, including ASCII art animations (notably Star Wars), games (MUDs, roguelikes, interactive fiction), informational services (weather, ham radio, dictionaries), and historical BBS systems. The page serves as a preservation effort for text-based internet services that predate the modern web.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is steeped in nostalgia for the simpler, text-based internet of the 1980s-2000s. Many commenters share formative experiences: discovering telnet through the famous Star Wars ASCII animation at towel.blinkenlights.nl, learning how email protocols work by hand-crafting POP3 commands, and bypassing school internet filters using cmd.exe and telnet. Several users reminisce about MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and their dual nature as both programming education and academic distraction.

A significant portion of the thread revolves around the current status of towel.blinkenlights.nl. Multiple users report it as defunct or inaccessible, though one commenter who knows the creator confirms it still runs on both IPv4 and IPv6 (with the IPv6 version having additional content). Some connection failures appear to stem from modern systems lacking telnet clients by default—macOS and many Linux distributions no longer include it, requiring manual installation of packages like inetutils-telnet.

Practical and security considerations emerge throughout. One user notes that telnet.wiki.gd employs a frustratingly obtuse CAPTCHA. Others observe that SSH has largely superseded telnet for services like nethack.alt.org, and that modern network security practices make plaintext telnet connections inadvisable outside of encrypted tunnels like Tailscale or ZeroTier. VMG warns that ANSI escape sequences in telnet services can pose security risks including remote code execution.

The conversation touches on broader themes: the "purity" of text interfaces free from JavaScript frameworks and cookie banners, with some speculating about a possible return to simpler protocols as the modern web becomes increasingly saturated with AI-generated content and advertising. Alternative services are suggested, including telehack.com (which offers a "starwars" command), SSH-accessible mirrors of classic animations, and surviving MUD servers. Domain name trivia surfaces regarding tel.net, sms.net, and teln.et.
