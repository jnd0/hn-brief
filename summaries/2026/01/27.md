# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-27

## [TikTok users can't upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec)
**Score:** 1119 | **Comments:** 770 | **ID:** 46779809

> **Article:** CNN reports that TikTok users are experiencing difficulties uploading videos critical of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), with the company attributing the issue to technical glitches. This occurs in the context of TikTok's forced sale to US-based ownership under the Biden administration's divestiture law, which was later supported by the Trump administration. The timing raises questions about whether "technical difficulties" are being used as cover for politically-motivated content suppression.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion rapidly expands beyond the specific TikTok/ICE incident into broader debates about platform censorship, propaganda, and the nature of free speech in an era of political polarization.

Several commenters draw historical parallels to state media manipulation. One shares a personal story from 1989 Czechoslovakia where state TV claimed "technical difficulties" to avoid showing police violence against protesters—a pattern others recognize from Mexico's disputed 1988 election ("se cayó el sistema"). These anecdotes frame TikTok's explanation with deep skepticism.

The conversation fractures along competing narratives about *whose* censorship is worse. One thread argues the US TikTok ban itself constitutes censorship designed to hide information Americans can see elsewhere. Another counters that global TikTok already operates as Chinese propaganda, algorithmically amplifying negative content about the US while filtering out Tiananmen Square or Tibet material—described as "the most brutally honest propaganda." This sparks debate about whether highlighting actual US foreign policy actions constitutes propaganda or simply "facts."

The discussion reveals striking mirror-image anxieties. Some users warn that tools built against "currently designated bad people" (undocumented immigrants) will inevitably expand; others recall how "cancel culture" and COVID-era content moderation previously targeted right-leaning views. Multiple participants note the irony that both sides now accuse each other of the same tactics they once defended.

A significant subthread examines whether recent changes to TikTok's algorithm—reported by multiple users who noticed their feeds suddenly reset to unrelated content—signal broader platform manipulation. Reports that "Epstein" is being blocked in DMs fuel concerns about rapid "Orbanisation" of the platform under new ownership.

Underlying much of the discussion is exhaustion with partisan asymmetry in outrage. Several commenters observe that objections to government overreach, deplatforming, and media bias appear to depend entirely on which side holds power, with one noting: "You don't understand. It's different: *they* were doing it. The Bad Guys. Now *we*, the Good Guys, are doing it." The rare calls for principled consistency—opposing censorship regardless of target—struggle against the gravitational pull of tribal defense.

## [Kimi Released Kimi K2.5, Open-Source Visual SOTA-Agentic Model](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html)
**Score:** 446 | **Comments:** 210 | **ID:** 46775961

> **Article:** Moonshot AI (Kimi) has released Kimi K2.5, an open-source visual agentic model with 1 trillion parameters (32 billion active). It claims state-of-the-art performance on agentic tasks and achieves >50th percentile on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark. The model uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and is released under an MIT license with a notable modification: companies with >100 million MAU or >$20 million monthly revenue must prominently display "Kimi K2.5" in their product UI. The model supports native INT4 quantization and features advanced agentic capabilities including self-directed "agent swarms" with up to 100 sub-agents and 1,500 parallel tool calls.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: licensing pragmatics, hardware feasibility, and strategic implications of Chinese open-source AI.

**Licensing drew immediate skepticism.** Several commenters parsed the MIT modification as essentially a free tier with brand-attachment enforcement—dheera questioned why they didn't simply charge $1M instead of the UI attribution requirement. Others saw it as clever marketing: get ubiquitous embedding in successful products without the friction of upfront negotiation.

**Hardware requirements sparked debate about "local" viability.** Endymi0n's initial reaction—that 1T parameters (~500GB at INT4) makes home deployment impossible—was challenged by johndough and others familiar with the LocalLLaMA community. The MoE architecture changes the calculus: only 32B parameters are active per token (~16GB), enabling everything from SSD-streaming (slow but cheap) to dual Mac Studio M3 Ultras (~$20K) to 8xH100 or 16xH100 NVLink configurations ($500K+). Simonw noted MLX makes Mac deployment practical, while NitpickLawyer and Barathkanna distinguished between "technically runs" and "actually usable for agentic work," with the latter requiring serious infrastructure. WhitneyLand raised the underexplored question of quantization quality loss—whether a lobotomized trillion-parameter model beats a properly-sized smaller one.

**The "why free?" question provoked geopolitical analysis.** Motoboi's genuine puzzlement about the business model was answered with references to Chip War-style strategic competition: China treating AI as a sunk-cost infrastructure play to nullify US leads, validate relevance, and force rivals into expensive innovation cycles. Whizzter and deskamess framed this as open collaboration as competitive weapon—if the next search winner builds on Kimi, Chinese worldview propagation comes bundled. Bertili contrasted this with OpenAI's "protecting humanity" closedness, though PlatoIsADisease dismissed the Deepseek parallel as marketing hype with astroturfed Reddit engagement.

**Technical capabilities also attracted interest.** Jumploops highlighted the RL-trained agent orchestration (not just tool calling), while storystarling immediately flagged the unit economics nightmare of 1,500 tool calls per task. XCSme and others clarified the architecture: the model outputs orchestration decisions, with external infrastructure handling the actual parallel execution. Vessenes connected this to broader "agent orchestration" patterns—Gas Town, Claude's swarm mode, Wiggum loops—where context-length sweet spots meet parallel specialization.

## [Cloudflare claimed they implemented Matrix on Cloudflare workers. They didn't](https://tech.lgbt/@JadedBlueEyes/115967791152135761)
**Score:** 439 | **Comments:** 168 | **ID:** 46781516

> **Article:** A Cloudflare blog post claimed the company had "implemented Matrix on Cloudflare Workers" for encrypted team communications. However, investigation of the linked GitHub repository revealed this was not a genuine implementation. The repository showed signs of being AI-generated "vibe code": only two commits, removal of TODO comments in a "cleanup" commit, and code that was incomplete and non-functional. The author was identified as a Senior Engineering TPM at Cloudflare, not a software engineer. After criticism, the blog post was updated to call it a "proof of concept" though contradictory claims about production use remained. The repository was also modified to remove "production grade" claims and add AI assistance disclosures.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community quickly identified this as another instance of AI-generated code being misleadingly presented as a serious technical achievement, coming shortly after a similar debunking of Cursor's browser-building claims. Commenters used simple heuristics to detect problems: just two commits in the repository history, and a suspicious commit that merely "cleaned up code comments" by removing all TODOs—suggesting the author didn't understand what they were publishing.

The incident triggered broader concerns about Cloudflare's technical credibility. Many noted this was uncharacteristic for a company whose blog normally sets industry standards for technical depth and transparency. Several theories emerged: an individual employee published without proper review, corporate pressure to demonstrate AI productivity drove corners to be cut, or leadership's personal involvement in blog reviews (reportedly including the CEO/CTO) failed to catch this case.

The discussion connected to a pattern of infrastructure companies overstating capabilities in technical marketing. Commenters contrasted this with Cloudflare's normally excellent reputation, suggesting the fix would be simple precision—labeling something "we prototyped" rather than "we implemented." Some worried about implications for trust in Cloudflare's core services, given this involved a TPM (Technical Program Manager) apparently passing off incomplete AI-generated code as production-ready infrastructure handling encrypted communications.

A productive tangent emerged when one commenter, who had previously debunked the Cursor browser story, shared their own successful experiment: building a functional browser in 20K lines of Rust with a single AI agent in far less time than Cursor's much-hyped effort. This served as a counterpoint showing what genuine AI-assisted engineering looks like versus marketing-driven claims.

## [U.S. government has lost more than 10k STEM PhDs since Trump took office](https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office)
**Score:** 399 | **Comments:** 300 | **ID:** 46784263

> **Article:** A Science.org article reports that the U.S. federal government has lost more than 10,000 STEM PhD employees since Donald Trump took office. This represents a significant brain drain from government scientific agencies, attributed to funding cuts, policy changes, and an unwelcoming environment for foreign researchers. The National Science Foundation (NSF) budget was reportedly cut 55% in the first year of the administration, and research grants have been reduced across agencies, disrupting international collaborations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep divisions in how to interpret this brain drain, with commenters clustering around several distinct positions.

**Skepticism of credential value vs. alarm about institutional damage**

A minority view, expressed by JuniperMesos, challenges the premise that losing STEM PhDs is inherently harmful. They argue that academia produces substantial low-quality research, and not all PhDs create value for taxpayers—suggesting credential inflation rather than genuine expertise loss may be at play. This drew strong rebuttals, particularly from ixtli, who noted there's no evidence the departures filter for productivity; rather, the most mobile and talented researchers likely exit first. Retric countered that scale matters: evaluating 10 individuals differs fundamentally from losing 10,000, and many departed researchers were "extremely underpaid while providing extreme value."

**Geopolitical competition and China's rise**

Multiple commenters frame this as part of a larger structural shift. Ixtli and others cite China's massive engineering graduation numbers—orders of magnitude beyond the US, disproportionate even to population differences—as evidence of accelerating divergence. A European researcher (adev_) reports that collapsed US-EU collaborations are being replaced by EU-China partnerships, with "10x more conferences in China" and expanded joint projects. They argue US policy is directly "fueling new technologies to the country you consider your enemy." CharlieDigital adds a cultural layer, referencing a Freakonomics analysis contrasting China's engineer-led governance with America's lawyer-dominated leadership culture—builders versus arguers.

**Private sector optimists versus public good advocates**

Ccheney argues this redistribution is positive, enabling fusion startups and aerospace companies (SpaceX, Rocket Lab) to access talent pools previously locked in government. This triggered sharp responses about mission divergence. Kaitai, referencing DOGE's "more productive" framing, distinguishes corporate profit from societal value, using a VA physician example: underpaid relative to private markets, but practicing better medicine when freed from billing optimization. JohnFen extends this, noting many critical functions—basic research, veterans' care, non-commercial science—simply don't align with profit motives and suffer when measured by that yardstick.

**Personal displacement and systemic pessimism**

Several commenters report direct experience: a Dutch engineer (retired) emigrated due to economic infeasibility, expressing pessimism about Western Europe's future despite current quality-of-life advantages. Surgical_fire challenges this as overreaction, citing Netherlands employment data. Kevinsync asks whether any policy reversal could repair trust, suggesting reputational damage may persist even if administrations change—"I sure wouldn't want to go back to a bar where the bouncer kicked the shit out of me."

The thread's emotional arc moves from credential skepticism toward broad anxiety about institutional decline, with China positioned as the consistent beneficiary of Western scientific retrenchment.

## [Celebrities say they are being censored by TikTok after speaking out against ICE](https://www.pride.com/culture/celebrities/tiktok-censoring-megan-stalter-and-finneas)
**Score:** 319 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46777652

> **Article:** The article from Pride.com reports that celebrities including Megan Stalter and Finneas (Billie Eilish's brother) have claimed their TikTok content criticizing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is being suppressed or censored. The piece suggests this is part of a pattern following TikTok's forced sale to a consortium led by Oracle's Larry Ellison, with close ties to the Trump administration. Celebrities noted significant drops in engagement and visibility for posts critical of immigration enforcement, raising concerns about political content moderation on the platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion quickly diverged from the article itself into a meta-debate about why the post was flagged and broader concerns about platform governance, political discourse, and capitalism.

**On flagging and HN's culture:** Multiple users expressed frustration that the post was flagged, with iceflinger questioning why a major platform ownership change with apparent functionality impacts wouldn't warrant tech discussion. Others like dudefeliciano and saubeidl suggested flagging reflects a "proto-fascist contingent" suppressing regime-critical content, while thunky lamented the lack of genuine cross-perspective dialogue on HN, attributing this to downvote misuse. Direwolf20 noted it only takes four flags to silence opposition.

**On TikTok's new ownership and alleged censorship:** Jauntywundrkind delivered a scathing critique of the Ellison family's rapid changes, predicting "endless utterly preposterous censorship and algorithmic biasing for the right wing ultra capitalist agenda," and criticized the Supreme Court's unanimous decision enabling the forced sale. Others like baxtr offered more neutral explanations, suggesting algorithmic unpredictability rather than intentional suppression. However, mrtksn cited the documented collusion between tech billionaires and the political class as reason to suspect deliberate throttling, while SilverElfin connected this to broader patterns of non-transparent algorithmic manipulation across social platforms.

**On capitalism and power:** A substantial thread emerged around scotty79's framing of capitalism as "a system of power in which capital can (and almost always does) overrule everything else," with democracy merely being "how capital rules." This sparked debate—keybored called it contradictory, while 0x3f countered that all large-scale systems become gamed by the powerful. Tormeh suggested the TikTok situation resembles mercantilism more than pure capitalism given heavy government involvement.

**On alternatives and practical responses:** Rsynnott suggested celebrities simply abandon regime-controlled platforms, though vanviegen challenged whether viable, pressure-resistant alternatives exist at scale. Colpabar unexpectedly praised 4chan's anonymity and lack of voting for enabling genuine discovery, despite its toxicity. Theshrike79 floated incompetence (Oracle infrastructure issues) as an alternative explanation to malice for the reported problems.

The discussion ultimately revealed deep polarization—supporters of ICE like ap99 framed opposition as wild interference with federal law enforcement, while critics like tastyface and saubeidl drew parallels to historical abuses of state power, with saubeidl citing polling showing majority support for abolishing ICE.

## [FBI is investigating Minnesota Signal chats tracking ICE](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041)
**Score:** 310 | **Comments:** 312 | **ID:** 46783254

> **Article:** The NBC News article reports that the FBI is investigating a group of activists in Minnesota who used Signal encrypted messaging to coordinate protests and track ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. The investigation centers on whether protesters engaged in illegal activities such as obstructing federal officers or accessing restricted law enforcement databases to obtain license plate information. The case highlights tensions between encrypted communication privacy and law enforcement surveillance capabilities, particularly regarding metadata exposure through phone numbers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around several interconnected themes: the practical limits of Signal's privacy protections, constitutional rights versus investigative powers, and broader political concerns about government overreach.

**Signal's Metadata Vulnerabilities**
Multiple commenters emphasized that while Signal encrypts message content, phone numbers remain exposed as metadata—a limitation ddtaylor noted can be "enough metadata to be a big problem." Charliebwrites outlined a concrete attack chain: identify a number's owner, compel phone unlock, then access all group chat messages. SR2Z countered that modern phone encryption (passcodes, BFU states) makes this difficult without coercion, suggesting informants are more likely than technical bypasses. Craftkiller added nuance about GrayKey and GrapheneOS BFU as the "only defense" against forensic tools.

**Legal and Constitutional Tensions**
Bediger4000 questioned why tax money funds investigation of "unequivocally constitutionally protected speech," prompting tptacek's clarification that while prosecution requires evidence of crime, investigation rights are "much, much narrower," especially with existing data. Janalsncm extended this to note First Amendment protections are only "freedom from certain consequences"—arrests and charges can still occur before courts intervene. JumpCrisscross distinguished between protected speech and illegal acts said in chat.

**Allegations of Actual Crimes**
Andreygrehov and mothballed introduced unverified claims that protesters accessed NCIC databases or ran license plates illegally—potentially triggering 18 U.S.C. § 372 conspiracy charges. DerbOac questioned whether "unlawfully scanning license plates" even constitutes a crime given public visibility and commercial database access.

**Political Framing and Distrust**
Comments reflected deep polarization: therobots927's "The fascists won" versus jatora's "vigilante justice" framing. Epistasis noted DOJ prosecutors resigned after being directed to investigate a shooting victim's family rather than the ICE agents involved. Crystal_revenge offered institutional skepticism, comparing Palantir hype to typical startup overpromising and suggesting "incompetence might be the greatest safety we have against a true dystopia." Chinathrow demanded FBI prioritize investigating "murders done by ICE."

**Technical Countermeasures**
Disappearing messages received mixed assessment—useful but imperfect if any participant is compromised. OhMeadhbh noted activation is local-device dependent. The discussion briefly touched on hardware security (latest iPhone BFU protections per dvtkrlbs) and provocative references to Second Amendment resistance (ActorNightly) and historical surveillance analogies (sixsevenrot's IBM/Holocaust comparison).

## [I made my own Git](https://tonystr.net/blog/git_immitation)
**Score:** 300 | **Comments:** 136 | **ID:** 46778341

> **Article:** A developer (TonyStr) built a minimal version control system called "tvc" from scratch to understand Git's internals. Written in Rust, the project implements core Git concepts: blob/tree/commit objects, SHA-256 content addressing, zlib compression, and basic commands (init, add, commit, log, ls). The author deliberately avoided looking at Git's source code, instead working from first principles and documentation. The implementation uses YAML for object serialization (partly as a learning exercise), stores objects in a content-addressable filesystem, and includes a simple CLI. The project served as an educational exercise to demystify how Git actually works under the hood.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion branched into several interconnected themes. A significant thread emerged around AI training and code scraping—TonyStr noted with surprise that their repository had 49 clones from 28 unique users before any public announcement, strongly suggesting automated bots scraping GitHub for LLM training data. This sparked dark humor about "poisoning" LLMs with circular self-references and deliberate bugs, alongside more serious observations about the unsettling feeling of having imperfect learning code absorbed into training datasets.

Technical implementation choices generated substantial debate. Several commenters suggested SQLite for storage (with grenran noting this is essentially what Fossil does), though others pointed to impedance mismatches with DAG traversals and history rewriting. The conversation naturally flowed into Fossil SCM itself—its local-first design, lack of staging, and philosophical commitment to century-durable plaintext formats. TonyStr expressed curiosity about Fossil's unique design decisions, and embedding-shape and graemep shared experiences using it for personal projects while acknowledging Git's overwhelming network effects.

Performance and security considerations surfaced around hashing. Commenters debated SHA-256 versus BLAKE3, with jrockway emphasizing SHA-256's surprising slowness even on fast hardware, while EdSchouten countered that ARM64's native SHA-256 instructions often reverse this. The discussion touched on Content Defined Chunking for large files and Git's eventual migration to SHA-256 despite SHA-1's demonstrated collision vulnerabilities.

Merge strategies became another tangent—nasretdinov praised Git's underutilized recursive merge with rerere for remembering conflict resolutions, while mkleczek advocated for Pijul's approach of treating conflicts as first-class repository objects. The ever-present jujutsu (jj) received its obligatory mention as an alternative VCS frontend.

Finally, architectural suggestions circled back to whether new VCS projects should innovate on Git's storage layer (enabling compatibility) versus building entirely fresh. PunchyHamster argued for reusing Git's storage and network infrastructure, letting innovation happen at the UI layer—preserving CI/CD integration and easing migration. TonyStr acknowledged performance limitations in their naive implementation, particularly around recomputing hashes and redundant file operations, suggesting awareness of these tradeoffs without yet optimizing them.

## [430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/science/archaeology-neanderthals-tools.html)
**Score:** 280 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46781530

> **Article:** Archaeologists have discovered 430,000-year-old wooden tools in Germany, representing the oldest well-preserved wooden tools ever found. The artifacts, attributed to Neanderthals, include digging sticks and spears found in waterlogged sediments that enabled exceptional preservation. This find pushes back the known timeline for sophisticated woodworking and provides rare direct evidence of organic tool use by early hominins, as wood typically decomposes and leaves little trace in the archaeological record.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion opened with surprise at the age of the tools, with user drakythe expressing astonishment that tools existed 430,000 years ago—predating Homo sapiens. Several commenters clarified that tool use extends far deeper into prehistory than commonly understood. throwup238 explained that the Oldowan stone tool industry dates back 2-3 million years, and that indirect evidence of woodworking through phytolith and microwear studies already pointed to woodworking at least 1.5 million years ago. The significance of this find, they noted, lies in preservation rather than demonstrating unprecedented capability.

JumpCrisscross introduced a darker anthropological perspective, citing Jane Goodall's observation that humans, chimpanzees, and wolves share a uniquely genocidal tendency toward exterminating competitors rather than merely displacing them. They speculated this trait may have distinguished Homo sapiens from other hominids who were "fine sharing the world," suggesting the uncanny valley response might reflect an evolved adaptation to non-human hominids. This prompted mixed reactions—MarcelOlsz found it depressingly plausible while jama211 dismissed it as unsubstantiated speculation.

A tangent emerged around suppressed archaeological evidence, with an0malous promoting Michael Cremo's "Forbidden Archaeology" and claiming older tool evidence is ignored due to scientific dogma. This drew skepticism from drakythe and others, though 3RTB297 offered a nuanced defense about institutional incentives favoring incremental over revolutionary findings, citing historical examples like plate tectonics and warm-blooded dinosaurs. an0malous doubled down with references to Thomas Kuhn and alleged Wikipedia bias.

The discussion also touched on construction materials, with melenaboija reflecting on wood's durability and environmental advantages over concrete, sparking debate about American versus European building traditions. barbacoa noted that modern reinforced concrete's iron rebar causes premature deterioration compared to ancient Roman concrete. Finally, HocusLocus and tootie debated whether science adequately considers "lost" cycles of human development, with tootie defending mainstream archaeology's implicit acknowledgment of vast undiscovered organic material culture.

## [A list of fun destinations for telnet](https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46775135

> **Article:** A curated list of active telnet destinations accessible via telnet.org/htm/places.htm, featuring ASCII art services, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), and other text-based internet services. The most famous entry is towel.blinkenlights.nl, which plays the original Star Wars film as ASCII animation.
>
> **Discussion:** Nostalgia and discovery dominated the thread, with multiple users sharing how they first encountered telnet—often through the Star Wars ASCII animation, which one user described as "discovering a secret passage in the internet." Others recalled learning email protocols by hand-crafting POP3 and SMTP commands over telnet, with one commenter tracing their entire career from that starting point through building email clients and web servers.

The purity of text-based interfaces resonated throughout: "No loading spinners, no JavaScript frameworks, no cookie banners. Just text." Several users confirmed that MUDs from the 1990s remain active 35 years later, with personal stories of friendships formed and academic careers nearly derailed by MUD addiction.

Practical matters interspersed the reminiscing. Modern systems no longer ship telnet by default for security reasons, prompting code contributions—a Python telnet client using telnetlib3—and troubleshooting when towel.blinkenlights.nl appeared unreachable (it still runs, possibly IPv6-only). Security concerns arose regarding ANSI escape sequences and their potential for exploitation compared to browser-sandboxed JavaScript.

The thread touched on possible futures: retreat from the ad-saturated web to text protocols like Gopher, Gemini, or IRC, though skeptics noted advertisers would follow popularity. A whimsical CAPTCHA puzzle at telnet.wiki.gd briefly stumped users before yielding to "Venera Venera Venera." The list's own domain drew commentary—missed opportunities for tel.net or telnet.net, and historical echoes of simtel.net.

## [Xfwl4 – The Roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor](https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_15.html)
**Score:** 232 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 46779645

> **Article:** The article outlines the roadmap for xfwl4, a new Wayland compositor for the XFCE desktop environment. The project aims to create a Rust-based compositor using the Smithay library that will eventually replace xfwm4 (XFCE's current X11 window manager). The author discusses the motivations for this transition, including Wayland's architectural advantages over X11, the desire for better security and isolation, and the benefits of using Rust for memory safety. The roadmap covers multiple phases: initial development of core functionality, achieving feature parity with xfwm4, and eventual integration into XFCE as the default. The project emphasizes maintaining XFCE's traditional behavior and lightweight philosophy while modernizing the underlying technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on whether XFCE's traditional userbase will accept both Wayland and Rust, with commenters divided on whether these technologies align with XFCE's conservative values. A long-time XFCE user (coldpie) argues that the community simply wants things that work without unnecessary change, and that most users don't care about implementation languages—only that the transition be handled competently.

A significant thread explores Wayland's merits and drawbacks. Critics like ok123456 view Wayland as a regression with serious usability problems, fragmentation from missing features, and excessive complexity compared to simpler protocols like SMTP. Defenders, particularly jchw, counter that Wayland's protocol-centric design prevents the ossification that plagued X11, enables better handling of modern display features (DPI scaling, HDR, multi-head), and improves security through client isolation. Jchw acknowledges Wayland's radical design choices—such as eliminating global coordinate space—create implementation challenges and slow development, but argues these tradeoffs yield a more maintainable foundation.

Performance concerns surface regarding whether Wayland's mandatory compositing can match uncomposited X11's responsiveness on low-end hardware. Fiveplus and PunchyHamster question whether input-to-pixel latency can be preserved, while jchw explains mitigation strategies like hardware plane unredirection and notes that higher refresh rates reduce the perceptible impact. The consensus appears to be that some latency increase is unavoidable, representing a necessary tradeoff for modern rendering capabilities.

**Score:** 229 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46781707

> **Article:** CNN reports that Amazon is shutting down its Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores and Amazon Fresh grocery stores. The closures mark a significant retreat from Amazon's physical retail expansion, which had been positioned as a major growth area leveraging the company's technology and logistics expertise. Amazon Go stores used "Just Walk Out" technology allowing customers to grab items and leave without checkout, while Fresh stores were full-service grocery locations meant to compete with traditional supermarkets.

> **Discussion:** The discussion is minimal and procedural rather than substantive. Multiple users (ChrisArchitect, chrisbolt, bigwheels) quickly identified this as a duplicate submission pointing to an earlier discussion at item ID 46781444. Moderator dang consolidated comments to that thread, and bigwheels provided a macro-expanded link to a related submission with 14 comments.

## [Prism](https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism)
**Score:** 216 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46783752

> **Article:** OpenAI has launched **Prism**, a web-based LaTeX editor with integrated AI features aimed at academic writing and publishing. The tool appears to compete with Overleaf, offering collaborative editing, AI-assisted writing, literature search, citation management, and document formatting. Based on the discussion, it evolved from an earlier project called crixet.com and represents OpenAI's entry into the academic publishing tools space.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion around Prism reveals deep skepticism about AI's role in scientific publishing, alongside technical comparisons to existing tools. The most prominent concern comes from **JBorrow**, a journal editor, who argues that AI writing tools dramatically lower barriers for "vibe-written" submissions—plausible-sounding but substantively hollow papers that waste reviewers' already-stretched volunteer time. They describe receiving submissions from unqualified authors (e.g., an accounting undergraduate submitting cosmology papers) generated entirely by AI, and question whether lowering barriers to entry actually benefits science when the hard work has always been understanding research context and producing novel findings, not formatting papers.

This concern resonated widely. **InsideOutSanta** drew a parallel to AI-generated bug reports overwhelming bug bounty programs, coining the grim phrase: "We're truly living in a post-scarcity society now, except that the thing we have an abundance of is garbage." **jcranmer** noted this pattern—LLMs flooding submission pipelines with semi-plausible content that passes initial garbage filters—has already destroyed publishers' "slush piles" and is now hitting open source repositories.

Proposed solutions sparked debate. **bloppe** suggested refundable submission fees that only return upon acceptance, effectively taxing frivolous submissions. **JBorrow** pushed back, noting their diamond open access journal deliberately charges nothing to accommodate legitimate researchers from underfunded institutions. **s0rce** added complexity, explaining that legitimate researchers often submit sequentially to multiple high-impact journals, making fee structures tricky.

The technical discussion revealed Prism as likely an Overleaf competitor, though opinions varied on its viability. **crazygringo** and others compared it to Overleaf's collaborative features, with some noting Prism's apparent minimalism versus Overleaf's richer toolset. The naming attracted criticism—**postalcoder** found "Prism" unfortunately evocative of NSA surveillance, though **cheeseomlit** countered that most non-technical people no longer make that association. Several commenters, including **markbao** and **auxym**, used the moment to critique LaTeX itself as outdated technology, with **crazygringo** and others pointing to **Typst** as a more modern alternative—though journal template requirements keep LaTeX entrenched.

A subtler critique emerged around what AI assistance actually provides. **ai_critic** observed that Prism's demo seemed focused on "finding papers to decorate the bibliography with" rather than genuine literature engagement, while **olivia-banks** shared a cautionary tale of removing a co-author for using AI-generated text with "not-insignificant" plagiarism. **vessenes** and others saw more constructive applications in literature search, methodology critique, and replication studies—suggesting the tool's value depends heavily on how researchers choose to use it.

## [Russia using Interpol's wanted list to target critics abroad, leak reveals](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gg729y1yo)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46776454

> **Article:** A BBC investigation reveals that Russia has been systematically using Interpol's wanted list to target political opponents and critics living abroad. The article focuses on the case of Dmitry Pestrikov, a former mining executive who fled Russia in June 2022 after allegedly embezzling 250 million rubles. Pestrikov discovered he was on an Interpol "red diffusion" notice after contacting the organization himself out of concern that the Kremlin might target him in France. After nearly two years on the list, Interpol's Commission for the Control of Files (CCF) ruled that his case was "predominantly political," noting that Russia's provided information was "generic and formulaic" with "inadequate explanation of the alleged crime," leading to the cancellation of the detention request. The report highlights this as part of a broader pattern of authoritarian regimes weaponizing international law enforcement mechanisms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals significant skepticism about the BBC's framing of Dmitry Pestrikov as a "government critic," with several commenters digging into his background. User kgeist provides a detailed counter-narrative: Pestrikov allegedly privatized a state corporation for pennies in the 1990s, had ongoing tax evasion issues from 2010-2020, threatened people with murder while holding a rifle in 2021, and only left Russia in 2022 after taking 250 million rubles without board approval—suggesting he's a "90s mafia" figure spinning a political persecution narrative to avoid consequences abroad. Braincat31415 echoes similar doubts about his credibility.

However, others push back on this skepticism. Embedding-shape notes that Interpol's own CCF ultimately ruled the case predominantly political and canceled the notice, finding Russia's submission inadequate. S_dev cites the well-documented Bill Browder case as clear precedent for Russian abuse of Interpol. Lazide makes the broader point that in Russia's judiciary, "every case is a political case" regardless of underlying facts.

The discussion expands to other examples of authoritarian Interpol abuse. BeetleB identifies Turkey as having "perfected this technique," with Americans who criticized Turkey online finding themselves on Interpol lists, providing multiple sources. Preisschild describes an ongoing Austrian court case where an official allegedly looked up addresses of critical journalists for FSB agents who later broke into their apartment. Goinghjuk mentions Russia inventing crimes to demand extradition of arrested affiliates, citing the BTC-e crypto exchange founder case.

Several threads explore the mechanics of Interpol notices. JasonADrury notes that private services advertise $500 cryptocurrency lookups on Russian forums like Rutor, while bilekas points out Interpol will confirm notices directly. Strken clarifies that most Red Notices are law-enforcement-only, with only a minority made public.

The conversation touches on broader themes: dvfjsdhgfv describes how Russian business culture systematically entraps entrepreneurs through necessary illegal payments, ensuring everyone is controllable; rdtsc warns of potential "exchange" arrests of Western citizens; and pydry frames London as collecting "activist Russian oligarchs" similar to Washington's ex-Iranian monarchists. A minor digression occurs around "ruzzians" spelling (explained as distinguishing pro-war Russians) and Turkey's tourism advertising contradictions. Cpursley flags concern about political posts devolving into ethnic hatred, while hexage1814 and mvdwoord make unsupported claims about Brazil and Dutch tax authorities respectively.

## [I let ChatGPT analyze a decade of my Apple Watch data, then I called my doctor](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/i-let-chatgpt-analyze-a-decade-of-my-apple-watch-data-then-i-called-my-doctor/ar-AA1UZxip)
**Score:** 205 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46772495

> **Article:** The article describes a journalist who fed ten years of Apple Watch health data into ChatGPT for analysis, receiving an "F" grade for cardiovascular health despite being an active, healthy individual. Alarmed by this assessment, the author consulted their doctor, who found nothing concerning. The piece explores the disconnect between algorithmic health scoring and medical reality, highlighting how AI interpretation of fitness metrics can produce misleading results that conflict with professional medical evaluation.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep tensions around AI in healthcare, with commenters sharing starkly contrasting experiences. One user describes a traumatic false positive where ChatGPT insisted on a terrifying diagnosis for his wife's blood work that specialists later ruled out, while another credits the AI with correctly identifying a rare gallbladder condition that multiple medical professionals initially dismissed. These anecdotes illustrate the unpredictable reliability of LLM medical analysis.

Several commenters emphasize fundamental limitations: LLMs are probabilistic text generators without genuine understanding, prone to "sticking to" confident-sounding but potentially wrong conclusions. The discussion highlights how health metrics require contextual interpretation that AI currently lacks—doctors evaluate patients holistically, while algorithms reduce complex health states to decontextualized numbers.

A significant thread debates responsibility and regulation. Some argue current disclaimers are insufficient given how OpenAI markets ChatGPT as trustworthy for serious decisions, with ads showing users relying on it for medical guidance. Others counter that restricting imperfect tools until they're near-perfect would mean never releasing them, and that clear "this may be wrong" messaging is the pragmatic approach. The comparison to countries requiring doctor involvement for blood test access surfaces as an alternative model.

Underlying much discussion is frustration with modern medicine's reactive posture—waiting until patients are "sick" rather than addressing subtle suboptimal states—creating demand that fitness enthusiasts and AI tools poorly fill. Commenters note the irony that doctors dismiss small deviations from optimal while readily prescribing medications with substantial side effects for larger problems, leaving a gap that unscientific self-optimization attempts to fill.

## [The age of Pump and Dump software](https://tautvilas.medium.com/software-pump-and-dump-c8a9a73d313b)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 66 | **ID:** 46780065

> **Article:** The article discusses "pump and dump" schemes in software, where developers create AI-powered coding tools primarily to generate hype and drive speculative investment in associated crypto tokens rather than to build sustainable, useful products. The author examines two prominent examples: Steve Yegge's "Gas Town" (an AI coding agent framework) and "Clawdbot/Moltbot" (an AI personal assistant), both of which launched with accompanying crypto tokens. The piece argues that these projects exploit the current AI hype cycle and crypto speculation, using impressive technical demos to attract investment while the underlying economic incentives are misaligned with creating genuine, lasting value. The author contrasts this with legitimate AI tooling development, suggesting these schemes represent a cynical exploitation of both technologies.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism about crypto-adjacent AI projects while surfacing genuine debate about how to distinguish legitimate experimentation from exploitation. Several users conducted independent investigations into Clawdbot/Moltbot, uncovering what they describe as coordinated spam networks, Reddit astroturfing, suspicious domain registrations, and critical security vulnerabilities—leading some to warn others away from the project entirely. Others defended Gas Town specifically as sincere technical exploration, noting Steve Yegge's explicit acknowledgment that it was designed without cost constraints and that users could learn valuable lessons about AI agent orchestration regardless of the crypto angle.

A recurring tension emerged between viewing these projects as genuine experimentation with immature technology versus cynical financial schemes. One participant characterized the era as "the Wild West, the time when software moved more swiftly than the law," while another countered that this framing romanticizes what amounts to exploitation. Several commenters drew parallels to traditional VC-backed startups as "the original pump and dump," where the "dump" is simply rebranded as "successful exit."

The technical merits of agent architectures sparked substantive discussion. Some found supervisor-worker patterns standard for distributed systems but economically uncompelling given current inference costs; others speculated future AI systems might actually prefer simpler, less abstracted codebases since they don't experience human aversion to boilerplate. Practical applications of AI coding tools received mention, with one user describing rapid prototyping of a computer vision project for ski lift analysis.

Underlying much of the conversation was pessimism about platform incentives. Multiple commenters noted how social media's reward structures amplify hype, with one insider claiming firsthand observation of billion-dollar scams accelerated by unregulated crypto gambling, AI capabilities exceeding public understanding, and high-speed information environments where "brilliant insiders cook" PR schemes on Telegram for "gullible audiences on Twitter." The emotional register ranged from weary resignation—"you cannot beat the capitalist machine"—to darker humor about future "butlerian jihad" against thinking machines, with TikTok potentially viewed as future generations view 19th-century ether proliferation.

## [India and EU announce landmark trade deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrnee01r9jo)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46778821

> **Article:** The BBC reports on a landmark trade agreement announced between India and the European Union, described as the most significant trade deal for either side in over a decade. The agreement aims to boost bilateral trade from €126 billion to €200 billion by 2033. Key provisions include India reducing tariffs on European engineering and chemical goods, while the EU will lower duties on Indian textiles, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural products. The deal also establishes a security and defense pact, with India joining European defense initiatives, and includes a mobility framework to ease short-term professional travel between India and the EU. The agreement comes amid shifting global trade dynamics, including US tariff policies under the Trump administration.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion quickly diverged from the trade deal itself into heated debates about immigration, geopolitical strategy, and media access. Several distinct threads emerged:

**Immigration as wedge issue.** The most contentious discussion centered on whether the mobility framework constituted an immigration threat. User breitling raised concerns about Canadian immigration becoming "lop-sided," prompting diego_moita to challenge this framing by comparing labor mobility to other imports Canada relies on. This exchange revealed deeper tensions: mekdoonggi criticized Canadian priorities as misplaced given US threats, while k4rli explicitly advocated for immigration from "culturally similar" countries rather than India. User alephnerd repeatedly intervened to clarify that the Reuters-reported draft terms contain no immigration provisions, suggesting coordinated disinformation efforts to derail the deal—comparing it to Chinese influence operations against EU-India cooperation.

**US vs. EU talent competition.** A significant thread examined whether Europe could compete with the US for skilled workers. Augusteo framed expanded mobility as healthy competition to the anxiety-inducing H1B system, while Espressosaurus speculated about "European flowering" as US policy turns inward. Fooker countered that EU tech salaries (outside Zurich/London) have stagnated to Bangalore-comparable levels, making the US's 3-4x compensation advantage decisive even accounting for healthcare and education benefits. Skinnymuch pushed back that US soft power persists despite temporary political disruption.

**Economic ideology and distribution.** Mmooss challenged the "talented people having more options is good for everyone" argument as trickle-down economics in disguise, noting that while free trade lifted millions from poverty in China and Brazil, US workers saw wage stagnation alongside wealth concentration. This sparked no direct rebuttal but illustrated skepticism about who benefits from mobility liberalization.

**Media access and paywalls.** Multiple users expressed frustration that BBC content is now paywalled for US visitors ($49.99/year), with profsummergig mourning its decline as a globally trusted source. Dewey defended the policy as reasonable given non-UK visitors don't fund it through taxes, while lenkite confirmed no paywall from India and valued BBC as insight into British state perspective.

**Geopolitical realignment.** Several comments framed the deal through great-power competition: deafpolygon saw it as economic stabilization against Trump tariffs; alephnerd emphasized India's role in arming Ukraine via ReArm Europe and defending Greece/Cyprus against Turkey; PlatoIsADisease ironically noted leftists celebrating free trade and gun ownership. Seanmcdirmid pushed back on partisan framing, observing that moderate support for free trade has been consistent while opposition has shifted across the political spectrum.

The thread was marked by alephnerd's repeated accusations of astroturfing and spamoflauge operations, with the user documenting extensive sourcing on Chinese disinformation campaigns and defense cooperation details—though tokai suggested these concerns were overstated for a single new account comment.

## [Lennart Poettering, Christian Brauner founded a new company](https://amutable.com/about)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 184 | **ID:** 46784572

> **Article:** Lennart Poettering (creator of systemd) and Christian Brauner have founded a new company called Amutable. According to their website, they are "building cryptographically verifiable integrity into Linux systems" with the goal that "every system starts in a verified state and stays trusted over time." Christian Brauner (CEO) and Daan De Meyer (founding engineer and systemd maintainer) participated in the HN thread to answer questions. The company appears focused on remote attestation and cryptographic verification of system integrity, though specific technical details remain limited.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism and hostility toward Amutable, rooted largely in community history with systemd. The top-voted comment from stackghost exemplifies this, citing Poettering's "rank arrogance" and "Apple-style you're holding it wrong sneers" during systemd's early days, and asking directly whether his attitude has changed or users can expect "more of the same paternalism." This resonated strongly with others who had lost hours troubleshooting systemd failures.

The core anxiety centers on what "cryptographically verifiable integrity" actually means in practice. Multiple commenters immediately interpreted this as DRM or remote attestation infrastructure that would benefit "Big Tech" at users' expense—"verifiable to who? Some remote third party that isn't me?" asked dTal. Concerns ranged from practical worries (Microsoft potentially mandating removal of user key enrollment for Secure Boot) to philosophical objections about computing freedom, with one commenter linking to Richard Stallman's "Can You Trust Your Computer?"

Defenders pushed back on several fronts. Daan De Meyer emphasized that disruptive systemd features are intended to be optional and opt-in, and that the team remains committed to open source. Others noted that remote attestation isn't inherently evil—it could enable verifiable open-source cloud services or protect against evil maid attacks. Some systemd supporters argued it represents genuine improvement over SysV init and Upstart.

The debate ultimately reflects two incompatible framings: Amutable's supporters see cryptographic verification as a flexible security primitive that can empower users if properly implemented, while critics see it as infrastructure that will inevitably be captured by platform vendors to restrict user freedom—particularly given the track record of similar technologies (SafetyNet, HDCP, Widevine, vendor-controlled Secure Boot) and Poettering's reputation for pushing controversial changes.

## [iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/iphone-5s-software-update/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46774108

> **Article:** Apple has issued a software update for the iPhone 5s, a device launched in September 2013—over 13 years ago. The update (build 12.5.7) replaces an expired certificate that was causing issues with basic functionality, rather than adding new features or security patches. The iPhone 5s originally shipped with iOS 7 and received its last major feature update with iOS 12 in 2018.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely centers on evaluating Apple's legacy support in context, with several distinct threads emerging. Many commenters praised Apple for maintaining even minimal support for such an old device, contrasting it sharply with Android's update ecosystem—where even expensive flagship phones often lose support within 18-24 months. The Pixel line was suggested as the best Android alternative for timely updates, though this recommendation drew pushback regarding persistent emergency calling bugs.

Several technically-minded commenters clarified that this wasn't a meaningful software update but rather a certificate replacement, with comparisons to Sony's annual Blu-ray DRM updates for the PlayStation 3. This sparked debate about what constitutes genuine support versus minimal maintenance to avoid legal liability or support costs. Some argued that certificate updates still matter practically, as expired certificates frequently render old devices non-functional "paperweights."

The conversation touched on broader philosophies of hardware longevity: some advocated for jailbreaking or open-sourcing obsolete devices rather than relying on vendor support, while others shared personal experiences of using decade-old iPhones as daily drivers. Notably, several users reported still using original and second-generation iPhone SE models, describing acceptable performance for basic tasks despite app compatibility limitations. The discussion also surfaced frustration from users locked out of older devices entirely when Apple account authentication requirements outpaced OS update availability—creating catch-22 situations where devices became unusable through remote policy changes rather than hardware failure.

## [State of the Windows: What is going on with Windows 11?](https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2026/01/25/state-of-the-windows-what-is-going-on-with-windows-11/)
**Score:** 132 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46772212

> **Article:** The linked article (dated January 25, 2026) analyzes the current state of Windows 11, presumably critiquing its direction under Microsoft's leadership. Based on discussion context, it likely covers Windows 11's persistent usability issues, design inconsistencies, unwanted features (ads, Copilot, cloud integration), and the tension between Microsoft's business interests and user needs. The title suggests an examination of whether Windows 11 has improved or deteriorated from its troubled launch.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep frustration with Windows 11's user experience, though with notable disagreement about severity and alternatives. A dominant theme is that Windows 11 feels designed against users' interests—loaded with ads, unwanted services, dark patterns pushing OneDrive, and persistent bloatware like Candy Crush. Multiple commenters describe the OS as a "disaster" or "toxic pit," with one arguing Windows 95 better embodies simplicity than Windows 11.

Practical workarounds emerge as a subtheme: power users recommend debloater scripts, third-party tools like StartAllBack, or purchasing IoT LTSC licenses for officially clean versions. The hardware advice of "just add 32GB RAM" underscores how resource-heavy the OS has become.

The "no alternatives" problem generates significant debate. Some assert Microsoft faces no competitive pressure—macOS 26 (Tahoe) draws its own criticism even from loyalists like John Gruber, while Linux desktop environments are dismissed as bloated and inconsistent, with configuration scattered across "WM control panel or DE control panel or some obscure .conf file." Others push back: Ubuntu and Red Hat offer corporate support, and with proper driver support, casual users adapt quickly. Gaming remains Windows' moat due to kernel-level anti-cheat software, though the CrowdStrike incident has renewed hope Microsoft might finally restrict kernel access.

Several commenters challenge whether HN represents broader sentiment, with one noting "people on HN hate it for sure, but this is a bit of an echo chamber"—countered by others citing YouTube gaming communities and the outsized influence of tech "thought leaders." Microsoft's apparent indifference sparks analysis: Windows no longer drives revenue (Azure and services do), and captive enterprise/consumer markets eliminate urgency to improve.

A poignant thread features someone working with seniors, whose requests distill to "stop innovating" (remove OneDrive dark patterns) and "innovate more" (customizable UI elements)—unified by simply "be nicer." Their refusal to switch to Mac despite iPhone/iPad ownership, rooted in perceived Office incompatibility, illustrates how ecosystem lock-in transcends technical reality.
