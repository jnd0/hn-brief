## [FBI is investigating Minnesota Signal chats tracking ICE](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041)
**Score:** 817 | **Comments:** 1160 | **ID:** 46783254

> **Article:** The NBC News article reports that the FBI is investigating a Minnesota-based group using Signal group chats to track and coordinate protests against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) activities. The investigation involves the FBI joining these encrypted chat groups to monitor communications. The group, reportedly including Minneapolis residents, has been organizing efforts to locate ICE vehicles and personnel. The investigation comes amid heightened tensions over immigration enforcement, with concerns about potential coordination between protesters and insiders with access to law enforcement information.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around several interconnected themes: the boundaries of constitutional protections, the technical realities of Signal's security model, and broader political anxieties about authoritarian drift in the United States.

**Legal and Constitutional Questions**
The initial comment frames the investigation as a waste of taxpayer money targeting "unequivocally constitutionally protected speech," prompting a nuanced exchange about the distinction between speech rights and investigative powers. Multiple users clarify that while the First Amendment protects against prosecution for speech, it offers minimal protection against investigation itself—particularly when law enforcement already possesses data through arrests or confidential informants. The specter of "conspiracy to commit a crime" charges is raised as the typical legal pathway for transforming protected speech into prosecutable activity.

**Technical Surveillance Concerns**
A significant thread examines Signal's privacy guarantees and their limitations. Users note that while Signal encrypts message content, phone numbers remain visible metadata—potentially enough to identify participants and compel device access. The discussion outlines a plausible attack chain: identify a group member through their number, compel them to unlock their phone, then access all group communications. Disappearing messages are suggested as a mitigation, though participants note this only helps if activated before compromise and doesn't prevent real-time surveillance if an infiltrator joins the chat. Some express vindication for long-held skepticism about Signal's phone number requirement, while others emphasize that no communication tool can fully protect against human compromise or compelled decryption.

**The Nature of the Investigation**
Conflicting interpretations emerge about how the FBI gained access. One user suggests simple infiltration of large group chats, while others imply more sophisticated methods or insider assistance—particularly regarding claims that protesters were "unlawfully scanning license plates," which some dispute as potentially just crowdsourced observation of publicly visible information.

**Broader Political Anxiety**
Perhaps the most striking element is the palpable concern about democratic backsliding. A European commenter asks whether conditions match their alarming appearance, comparing ICE tactics to historical paramilitaries and questioning why Second Amendment advocates aren't responding to what seems like their stated use case. American respondents describe a fragmented reality where experiences vary dramatically by political engagement and identity—tech workers may perceive "okay...ish" normalcy while targeted communities face "unimaginably bad" conditions. One detailed account describes federal agents firing tear gas and impact rounds at non-violent protesters, causing serious injury, with local police surveilling via drone and media largely ignoring the event.

The Second Amendment discussion reveals cynicism about its practical application: described variously as a "latent threat" proven ineffective, historically intended for state militia formation rather than individual resistance, and compromised by partisan alignment where "don't tread on me" advocates tolerate authoritarianism when properly "dressed up." Multiple users emphasize the difficulty of organized resistance when repression is unevenly distributed and escalation risks civil war.

**Institutional Distrust**
Comments reflect deep skepticism toward law enforcement and government competence. Palantir's surveillance technology is simultaneously feared as enabling rapid targeting and dismissed as overhyped vaporware whose "chilling effect" exceeds its actual capability. The observation that ICE appears to rely on crude profiling rather than sophisticated intelligence—despite Palantir contracts—feeds theories about authoritarianism's "non-linear" progression through contradictory messaging. Several users note that DOJ attorneys resigned after being blocked from investigating ICE shootings, instead being directed to investigate victims' families.

The discussion concludes with stark assessments: "The police (FBI and ICE included) are never your friends. They work to protect the rich and powerful and not us"—encapsulating a thread of left-libertarian or anarchist sentiment running through the technical community's response.

## [Prism](https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism)
**Score:** 689 | **Comments:** 431 | **ID:** 46783752

> **Article:** OpenAI has launched "Prism," a web-based LaTeX editor with integrated AI features aimed at academic writing. The tool appears to be a rebranded/evolved version of Crixet.com, which previously offered client-side WASM compilation before moving to server-side rendering. Prism allows users to write and compile LaTeX documents in the browser with AI assistance for tasks like finding and citing relevant papers, generating content, and editing. It is currently free to use, positioning it as a potential competitor to Overleaf, the dominant collaborative LaTeX platform.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism and concern about Prism's impact on scientific publishing, alongside criticism of its branding and technical positioning.

The dominant theme is alarm about AI flooding academic journals with low-quality submissions. Multiple commenters with direct experience—particularly JBorrow, a journal editor—describe how "vibe-written" papers are already overwhelming the volunteer peer review system. The tool lowers barriers for producing plausible-looking but substantively hollow research, with examples given of undergraduates in unrelated fields submitting AI-generated cosmology papers. Several participants draw parallels to other domains already damaged by AI slop: bug bounty programs drowning in fake reports, open source repositories flooded with low-quality contributions, and publishers' slush piles becoming unmanageable. The core anxiety is that LLMs make it easy to produce submissions that pass superficial quality checks while consuming scarce editorial resources, effectively constituting a DDoS attack on peer review.

A secondary thread concerns the name "Prism," which references the NSA's mass surveillance program exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013. While some express shock at this choice given ongoing concerns about digital sovereignty and eroding trust in US tech, others note that public memory of the program has faded significantly. The naming is seen as either remarkably tone-deaf or simply irrelevant depending on one's perspective of whether the Snowden revelations still matter.

On technical merits, comparisons to Overleaf dominate. Some users question why browser-based LaTeX is needed at all ("just install LaTeX"), while others value the visual/WYSIWYG-adjacent editing experience and collaboration features. The free price point attracts interest, though longevity concerns persist given OpenAI's history of discontinuing products. Previous Crixet users note that core LaTeX functionality may become AI-locked, reducing its value as a pure editing tool.

Proposed solutions to the submission spam problem include refundable submission fees contingent on acceptance, though diamond open access advocates counter that fees exclude legitimate researchers from underfunded institutions. More pessimistic voices suggest only radical measures—physical mail, proof-of-work systems, or simply letting the current system collapse—can restore quality control.

## [Cloudflare claimed they implemented Matrix on Cloudflare workers. They didn't](https://tech.lgbt/@JadedBlueEyes/115967791152135761)
**Score:** 526 | **Comments:** 195 | **ID:** 46781516

> **Article:** A Mastodon post by JadedBlueEyes accuses Cloudflare of falsely claiming to have implemented Matrix on Cloudflare Workers. The linked repository (github.com/nkuntz1934/matrix-workers) appears to be a low-quality, possibly AI-generated project with only two commits, minimal code, and signs of "vibe coding"—including TODO comments that were hastily removed after criticism. The blog post originally claimed "production grade" deployment with "real encrypted communications," but was later edited multiple times to walk back these claims, eventually being reduced to an "experiment" seeking contributions. The author is identified as a Senior Engineering TPM at Cloudflare, not a software engineer.

## [430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/science/archaeology-neanderthals-tools.html)
**Score:** 442 | **Comments:** 232 | **ID:** 46781530

> **Article:** The New York Times article reports on the discovery of 430,000-year-old wooden tools in Zambia, which are now the oldest well-preserved wooden tools ever found. These artifacts, including digging sticks and wedges, were crafted by early hominins—likely *Homo heidelbergensis* or early Neanderthals—long before *Homo sapiens* existed. The exceptional preservation occurred because the tools were deposited in waterlogged sediments at the Kalambo Falls site, which prevented decay. This find challenges previous assumptions about early technological capabilities, showing that complex woodworking skills existed much earlier than the archaeological record had clearly demonstrated.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals significant gaps in public understanding of human prehistory, with several users expressing surprise that tool use predates *Homo sapiens* by hundreds of thousands of years. The community helpfully clarifies that stone tool industries like the Oldowan date back 2–3 million years, and that indirect evidence of woodworking exists from 1.5 million years ago—making this find remarkable primarily for its preservation rather than proving entirely new capabilities.

A darker philosophical thread emerges around human nature, with JumpCrisscross invoking Jane Goodall's observation that humans, chimpanzees, and wolves share a uniquely genocidal tendency toward extermination rather than mere territorial defense. This leads to speculation that *Homo sapiens* may have prevailed over other hominids through systematic elimination rather than peaceful coexistence, with api extending this to the Fermi paradox and the concerning possibility that spacefaring civilizations tend to emerge from aggressively territorial species.

The conversation also touches on scientific institutional dynamics, with an0malous and 3RTB297 discussing how paradigm-shifting discoveries often face resistance, citing historical examples from plate tectonics to warm-blooded dinosaurs. This prompts debate about whether "forbidden archaeology" claims deserve more open-minded consideration or whether extraordinary claims properly require extraordinary evidence.

Finally, a practical tangent explores construction materials, with melenaboija reflecting on wood's surprising durability and Americans' continued reliance on timber construction compared to European concrete and stone—sparking discussion about environmental trade-offs and the longevity of unreinforced Roman concrete versus modern rebar-reinforced structures.

## [Thief of $90M in seized U.S.-controlled crypto is gov't contractor's son](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/single/lick-theft)
**Score:** 344 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46787521

> **Article:** A government contractor's son stole approximately $90 million in seized cryptocurrency that was under U.S. government control. The contractor's firm had been hired by U.S. Marshals to manage seized crypto assets from criminal investigations. The theft, which occurred in October 2024, was discovered not by government investigators but by crypto sleuth ZachXBT, who traced a wallet address revealed when one of the thieves—known online as "Lick"—screenshared during a dispute with another crypto thief over who was wealthier. The thief has since publicly mocked investigators, sending small amounts of Ethereum to them from the fraudulent wallets, and the government has reportedly been slow to acknowledge or act on the theft.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on several interconnected themes: the stunning incompetence of both the theft's execution and the government's response, broader political corruption, and the mechanics of seized crypto assets.

Commenters expressed amazement at how the thief essentially self-doxxed through sheer ego—livestreaming luxury purchases and engaging in a "who's wealthier" contest that revealed the wallet address. As one user noted, "Perfect crime undone by ego." The government's failure to detect the theft independently, and its subsequent reluctance to acknowledge it, drew heavy criticism about institutional decay.

The case became a jumping-off point for political debate. Several commenters tied the incident to current administration corruption, with discussions of pardons being "for sale" and comparisons to Trump's pardoning patterns. Others pushed back on partisan framing, noting the theft occurred under Biden and arguing that American political corruption has deep historical roots—"You started paying attention. That's all that changed." The erosion of institutional accountability was a recurring concern, with one user suggesting Watergate wouldn't register in today's news cycle.

The father's role remains ambiguous—whether complicit or merely negligent in securing assets his son accessed. Some commenters speculated the career damage would be worth $90 million for family escape, while others noted accepting a pardon constitutes legal guilt admission with potential disgorgement.

Practical questions arose about seized crypto: the government has shifted from auctioning holdings to maintaining a "strategic reserve," and multiple users shared stories of personally losing crypto to FBI exchange raids years ago, now worth fortunes. The discussion also touched on whether the thief's small ETH transfers to investigators could technically constitute bribes.

## [ICE and Palantir: US agents using health data to hunt illegal immigrants](https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s168)
**Score:** 338 | **Comments:** 161 | **ID:** 46794365

> **Article:** The BMJ article reports that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are using health data—including home addresses collected through Medicare and Medicaid enrollment—to locate and arrest undocumented immigrants. This represents a significant expansion of surveillance capabilities through Palantir's data analytics platform, which helps ICE cross-reference healthcare records with immigration databases. The practice raises serious concerns about medical privacy violations and the repurposing of sensitive health information for immigration enforcement, potentially deterring immigrants from seeking necessary medical care.

## [Lennart Poettering, Christian Brauner founded a new company](https://amutable.com/about)
**Score:** 322 | **Comments:** 487 | **ID:** 46784572

> **Article:** Lennart Poettering (creator of systemd) and Christian Brauner have founded a new company called Amutable. According to their website, they are "building cryptographically verifiable integrity into Linux systems" with the goal that "every system starts in a verified state and stays trusted over time." The company appears to be focused on remote attestation and verified boot technologies for Linux, extending security guarantees beyond what current Secure Boot implementations provide.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by skepticism and concern about Amutable's technology, with commenters drawing parallels to DRM, user freedom restrictions, and Poettering's controversial history with systemd.

**Trust and User Control**
The top concern centers on who controls the cryptographic keys. Multiple commenters reference Richard Stallman's "Can You Trust Your Computer?" essay, fearing this technology could enable remote parties to verify and potentially restrict what software users run. Founding engineer Aleksa Sarai (cyphar) responds that their attestation models are "based on users having full control of their keys," emphasizing both user freedom and enterprise security needs. However, this reassurance is met with skepticism given that half the founders come from Microsoft, a company frequently criticized for restrictive computing practices.

**Systemd History and Project Governance**
Several commenters raise Poettering's reputation for "paternalism" and "rank arrogance" during systemd's early development, when breaking changes were often dismissed with "you're holding it wrong" attitudes. Stackghost directly asks whether Lennart's approach has changed, while others note systemd's pattern of optional features becoming effectively mandatory through tight coupling. Systemd maintainer Daan DeMeyer responds that they try to make disruptive features opt-in, acknowledging they don't always succeed.

**Technical Debates**
Some participants distinguish between security benefits and freedom restrictions. Nextgrid argues current Linux Secure Boot is "effectively useless" since it only verifies the kernel, not initrd or userspace, and welcomes proper code signature verification. Others counter that remote attestation is inherently a form of DRM, citing existing restrictive technologies like SafetyNet, HDCP, and Widevine. Foxboron disputes the claim that Secure Boot prevents user key enrollment, calling it a "myth."

**Dystopian Scenarios**
Multiple commenters predict undesirable outcomes: banks refusing logins from "insecure" devices, streaming services blocking unverified systems, or Microsoft mandating removal of user key enrollment. Blibble offers dark humor that "anti-user attestation will at least be full of security holes." The fundamental tension throughout is between genuine security improvements and technologies that shift control from users to remote authorities.

## [ASML staffing changes could result in a net reduction of around 1700 positions](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 270 | **ID:** 46792370

> **Article:** ASML, the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer and near-monopolist in advanced lithography systems, announced a major restructuring that will eliminate approximately 1,700 positions net. The company is cutting 3,000 engineering manager roles while moving 1,400 of those individuals back into engineering positions. The stated goal is to reduce bureaucratic overhead—ASML claims engineers currently spend 35% of their time coordinating with managers—and refocus on engineering and innovation. The announcement coincides with a new €12 billion share buyback program running through 2028.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on whether ASML's restructuring represents genuine cultural renewal or early signs of corporate decline, with commenters drawing heavily on European tech industry experience.

**Management bloat as European disease.** Several commenters describe a recurring pattern where European industrial giants (Philips, Siemens and their numerous spinoffs) accumulate excessive management layers until innovation stalls. One engineer recounts how absorbing Philips television employees transformed a lean Belgian tech company into a dysfunctional, manager-heavy organization within years. Similar fates befell Siemens spinoffs like Infineon, Qimonda, and Continental—those without strong competitive moats often ended up stagnant or passed between private equity firms. The observation that Apple's in-house modems derive from Siemens-Infineon's former cellular division, with the same engineers thriving under American management, fuels speculation about systemic cultural or educational factors.

**ASML's specific situation draws mixed readings.** Some praise the move as "balsy"—noting ASML recognized its risk of becoming another Philips and acted decisively. Others worry the simultaneous €12 billion buyback signals financialization over engineering focus, with one commenter stating they've "never seen a company that starts doing buybacks not become a financialized hollow shell within a decade." This sparked a sub-debate about whether buybacks inherently indicate decline or simply represent tax-efficient capital return, with defenders pointing to Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft as counterexamples.

**Structural career path problems.** Multiple commenters highlight Europe's weakness in individual contributor (IC) career tracks, noting that engineers often must become managers to advance—producing "unhappy engineers and bad managers." The absence of senior IC roles comparable to American tech companies persists despite visible evidence of which model produces more innovation.

**Practical implementation questions.** Some wonder whether the cuts will actually reach working engineers or remain confined to management, with one former employee noting ASML historically felt "very engineer-y" rather than top-heavy. Others question whether mass layoffs—even of managers—damages employer brand precisely when ASML needs to attract talent for future growth.

## [Amazon closing its Fresh and Go stores](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-closing-fresh-grocery-convenience-150437789.html)
**Score:** 256 | **Comments:** 472 | **ID:** 46781444

> **Article:** Amazon is closing its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go convenience store locations, marking a significant retreat from its physical grocery and cashierless retail experiments. The company had invested heavily in "Just Walk Out" technology that promised to eliminate checkout lines, but the initiative struggled with operational challenges, high costs, and revelations that the supposedly AI-powered system relied heavily on human workers in India manually reviewing transactions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revealed deep skepticism about Amazon's grocery strategy and broader concerns about Big Tech's market tactics. Several commenters with firsthand experience described Amazon Fresh stores as poorly managed operations with expired products on shelves, unhelpful staff preoccupied with online order fulfillment, and a general mediocrity that only competitive pricing overcame—prices that some suspected were deliberately loss-leading to drive out local competition before raising them later.

The "Just Walk Out" technology attracted particular scorn after revelations that roughly 1,000 Indian workers were manually reviewing camera footage rather than pure AI handling transactions. Commenters noted this human backend made the economics untenable, especially as outsourced labor costs rose post-COVID, and expressed frustration that Amazon faced no consequences for what they characterized as misleading marketing. The experience itself drew mixed reactions: some found it frictionless and convenient once past the initial weirdness, while others felt surveilled and anxious about potential billing errors or being treated as presumed thieves.

Broader themes emerged about Amazon's pattern of behavior—duping small product inventors by undercutting them on price until they agreed to sell on the platform, running HQ2 selection theater while planning to locate where Bezos wanted regardless, and leaving behind vacant storefronts and "food deserts" when stores failed to open or closed. Some contrasted Amazon's sterile, surveillance-heavy environments unfavorably with traditional supermarkets like Wegmans or neighborhood bodegas and specialty shops, though others noted even Wegmans has declined recently. The discussion touched on whether dense urban neighborhoods with walkable specialty retailers actually want or need large supermarkets at all, suggesting Amazon fundamentally misunderstood what different markets value in grocery shopping.

## [Super Monkey Ball ported to a website](https://monkeyball-online.pages.dev/)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 75 | **ID:** 46789961

> **Article:** A developer has ported Super Monkey Ball to run in a web browser at monkeyball-online.pages.dev. The project is a TypeScript reimplementation rather than an emulator or direct decompilation running in WebAssembly. The game features the original's physics-based ball-rolling gameplay, though notably missing the monkey character inside the ball and some audio elements like the iconic falling scream. The author credits include roles for decompilation and porting, suggesting the work involved reverse engineering the original GameCube binary and transpiling the logic to TypeScript. The project is open source on GitHub under the name WebMonkeyBall.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community's reaction to this port was layered and increasingly skeptical. Initial comments praised the technical achievement, with users impressed that it was a clean TypeScript reimplementation rather than a typical emulator-in-wasm approach. However, suspicion quickly emerged about AI involvement—specifically Claude—generating much of the code. This was triggered by the settings page's aesthetic, code style observations, and the author's own admission of being a "newbie at webdev" who accepted a pull request to remove committed node_modules with the comment "Haha, almost certainly Claude."

The AI debate became contentious. Some defended the project as genuinely impressive regardless of methodology, while others raised concerns about transparency, particularly since the author was soliciting donations without disclosing AI assistance. One user (tarantino-sax) offered detailed technical analysis suggesting the code showed hallmarks of AI trained on community decompilation efforts—niche mechanics rendered perfectly while basic elements were missing or wrong, such as the absent monkey sprite and lack of proper animated billboard textures inside the ball.

Beyond the AI controversy, discussion touched on several nostalgic and technical threads: the historical significance of Super Monkey Ball as a GameCube launch title that demonstrated native app superiority over web apps (ironically contrasted with this web port), the game's arcade origins with its banana-shaped joystick, and comparisons to other browser ports like the now-removed GTA Vice City. Users noted control sensitivity differences from the original, with keyboard input feeling sharper than the GameCube's proportional joystick, though mobile play was reported as viable with adjusted settings. The missing monkey and iconic "Aaaah!" fall sound were frequently lamented as losses in translation.

**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46781707

> **Article:** CNN reports that Amazon is shutting down its Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores and Amazon Fresh grocery stores. The closures represent a significant retreat from Amazon's physical retail expansion strategy. Amazon Go stores, which used "Just Walk Out" technology allowing customers to grab items and leave without checking out, failed to achieve widespread adoption. Amazon Fresh, the company's grocery chain launched to compete with traditional supermarkets, also struggled to find a sustainable business model. The company appears to be refocusing on its core e-commerce and cloud computing businesses rather than continuing to invest in brick-and-mortar retail experiments.
>
> **Discussion:** This HN thread is minimal as moderators quickly identified it as a duplicate and redirected discussion to an earlier post. The only substantive activity consists of users ChrisArchitect, chrisbolt, and bigwheels identifying the duplication and linking to the original discussion at item ID 46781444, with moderator dang confirming the merge and thanking participants. Bigwheels noted a related macro-expanded thread with 14 comments that had also been posted 37 minutes prior. The complete discussion of Amazon's store closures took place in the earlier thread rather than here.

## [The age of Pump and Dump software](https://tautvilas.medium.com/software-pump-and-dump-c8a9a73d313b)
**Score:** 215 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46780065

> **Article:** The article "The age of Pump and Dump software" critiques a growing trend where software projects—particularly AI coding tools—are being used as vehicles for cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes. The author examines two prominent examples: "Gas Town" (an AI coding agent framework by Steve Yegge) and "Clawdbot" (later rebranded as Molt), noting how both projects launched associated crypto tokens that saw suspicious trading patterns. The piece argues that the AI hype cycle has created fertile ground for this exploitation, where technically impressive demonstrations serve to attract investment in essentially worthless tokens, with developers potentially profiting from the speculation while delivering little sustainable value.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism about crypto-adjacent AI projects while also defending genuine experimentation in the space. Several commenters, notably _pdp_, conducted independent analyses identifying spam networks, astroturfing campaigns, and security vulnerabilities in Clawdbot/Molt, with esskay countering that the rebranding was legitimate and forced by an Anthropic takedown notice. The debate centers on whether these projects represent good-faith exploration of agentic AI architectures—Leynos and others frame Gas Town's supervisor-worker pattern as valuable experimental work, with Yegge explicitly disclaiming cost concerns—or cynical exploitation of hype for token speculation.

The conversation broadens to consider what this era of software development signifies. justonceokay's evocative comparison to the Wild West and "butlerian jihad" possibilities captures the tension between viewing current AI experimentation as either primitive precursor or dangerously uncontrolled. Uehreka pushes back against the article's framing, arguing that learning from Gas Town without buying tokens constitutes legitimate use, while avaer—claiming insider experience with billion-dollar scams—argues the phenomenon represents an acceleration of age-old patterns through unregulated crypto gambling, AI opacity, and social media manipulation. leggerss attempts to separate the technical exploration from the crypto speculation, questioning why anyone would buy such tokens yet defending the software experiments themselves.

The economic viability of agentic architectures draws technical scrutiny, with storystarling questioning whether supervisor-worker patterns can overcome latency and inference costs, and simoncion noting Yegge's explicit disregard for expense. Polishdude20 offers a concrete counterexample of productive Cursor use for rapid prototyping, while isk517 identifies this as AI's genuine value proposition. The thread concludes with darker reflections: askl's observation that "VC startups are the original pump and dump software" and bayarearefugee's gallows humor about jailbreak vulnerabilities suggest pervasive cynicism about incentive structures in technology funding, whether traditional or crypto-based.

## [Time Station Emulator](https://github.com/kangtastic/timestation)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46786183

> **Article:** A web-based emulator that transmits WWVB time signals (the 60 kHz radio signal from NIST's atomic clock in Colorado) through a computer's audio output. The clever hack exploits the fact that digital-to-analog converters (DACs) produce harmonic frequencies during playback, and one of these harmonics matches the original 60 kHz fundamental frequency—leaking out as a short-range radio transmission via the wires and circuit traces in the audio output path. This allows users to sync radio-controlled clocks and watches without needing the actual long-range broadcast signal, which can be weak or unavailable in many locations.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community responded with a mixture of awe at the clever physics exploitation and practical interest in using the tool. Several commenters drew connections to Van Eck phreaking from 1982, noting that using unintended electromagnetic emissions from electronics has a long history, though modern sensitive receivers make such techniques more accessible. Others recalled similar stunts like turning hard drives into microphones and the "Scanjet 5p Ode to Joy" Easter egg.

Practical experiences were mixed: some users successfully synced Casio watches and classroom clocks, while others couldn't get it working on specific devices like Pixel 8 phones or Japanese-region clocks. Technical explanations clarified that WWVB itself has no "audio"—it's a 60 kHz carrier with once-per-second amplitude modulation, taking a full minute to transmit a complete data frame without error correction. One user noted that WWV (the voice time station) and WWVB are distinct, with the former offering the familiar droning voice announcements that some find nostalgically soothing.

The discussion touched on broader implications: NIST has considered retiring WWVB due to modern alternatives like GPS and NTP, making community solutions like this potentially valuable for legacy equipment. Some raised security concerns about malicious time spoofing, while others noted the shopping cart wheel lock vulnerability using similar low-frequency RF leakage—a 2008 hack resurfacing in new contexts. iOS users were directed to the "Clock Wave" app as an alternative, and one grateful commenter finally synced six Casio watches after a decade of frustration.

## [SoundCloud Data Breach Now on HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/SoundCloud)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46782930

> **Article:** SoundCloud has been added to Have I Been Pwned following a data breach affecting approximately 29.8 million user accounts (about 20% of their total userbase). The breach, discovered in December 2025, exposed email addresses, names, usernames, avatars, follower/following counts, and in some cases, country information. SoundCloud's official response downplayed the severity, stating that only email addresses and "information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles" were involved, and emphasized that no financial or password data was compromised. However, the critical issue is that the breach enabled attackers to map publicly available profile data to private email addresses—connecting data points that were not previously linked.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals significant skepticism toward both SoundCloud's handling of the breach and its broader business practices. Several commenters challenged SoundCloud's framing of the incident as merely exposing "public" data, noting that the linkage of email addresses to profile information—such as music preferences, follower counts, and usernames—creates new privacy risks that didn't exist when these data points were separate. One user illustrated this with a pointed example: connecting someone's email to their "liked artists" list could reveal embarrassing associations (like supporting a band after a public scandal).

The thread surfaced multiple complaints about SoundCloud's user-hostile practices beyond security. A hobbyist musician described how canceling a paid "Artist Pro" subscription led to their music being hidden and threatened with deletion—what they characterized as holding content "hostage." Another user detailed technical dysfunction in SoundCloud's systems, describing quota enforcement failures, "general jankiness," spam symbiosis with fake listener services, and concerning ToS changes permitting ML training on user uploads. These experiences led them to urge independent musicians to "grow up and do proper publishing" rather than relying on the platform.

Security practitioners in the discussion debated the practical risk of the breach. Some argued the data was already commercially available through data brokers, while others countered that free widespread distribution removes financial barriers to abuse. A particularly alarming anecdote described a targeted attack where someone used SoundCloud-derived information to compromise a user's email account despite two-factor authentication—suggesting the platform has become a vector for sophisticated social engineering against entertainment industry figures.

The conversation also touched on data deletion practices, with one user expressing pleasant surprise that their deleted account didn't appear in the breach, while another noted SoundCloud continues using old email addresses for marketing despite account changes—raising questions about actual deletion policies versus claimed ones. Several commenters advocated for email aliasing services to limit breach impact, though practical limitations were acknowledged: many sites block alias providers, and dedicated alias services may be less stable than major email platforms. The standard advice of unique passwords, password managers, and two-factor authentication was reinforced throughout.

## [Parametric CAD in Rust](https://campedersen.com/vcad)
**Score:** 184 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46786196

> **Article:** The article introduces **vcad**, a parametric CAD tool written in Rust that uses a "code-as-model" approach. The author describes their frustration with traditional GUI-based CAD workflows—where fixing a 2mm error requires clicking through menus—and proposes instead defining parts in Rust code with types, version control, and recompilation-based iteration. The tool is built on the Manifold geometry kernel (triangle mesh-based CSG) and emphasizes programmatic generation for robot parts like motor mounts and brackets. Notably, the author mentions designing it for AI coding agents as a key differentiator.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely centers on whether the author understands professional CAD workflows, with commenters pushing back on the premise that GUI CAD requires starting over when dimensions change—constraint-based parametric modeling in tools like SOLIDWORKS, Fusion 360, and FreeCAD already solves this. Several users characterize vcad as essentially a Rust-based OpenSCAD alternative: valuable for highly parametric parts (fasteners, gears, 3D-printed enclosures) but frustrating for organic or irregular shapes, likening it to "editing an SVG in notepad instead of Inkscape."

The technical foundation drew scrutiny: using a triangle mesh kernel (Manifold) rather than boundary representation (B-rep) limits precision for serious manufacturing applications, though defenders note it suffices for 3D printing and game asset workflows. Some saw unexplored potential in hybrid approaches—code-driven CAD with synchronized GUI editors that eliminate manual coordinate entry.

Other threads touched on learning paths (master hand-drawing and SOLIDWORKS before niche tools), existing alternatives (build123d, BOSL2 for OpenSCAD, SolveSpace), and the article's writing style, which several found AI-affected due to choppy punctuation-heavy fragments and explicit AI-agent targeting. The author engaged good-naturedly with criticism, acknowledging their inexperience and inviting contributions.

## [TikTok settles just before social media addiction trial to begin](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24g8v6qr1mo)
**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46786237

> **Article:** TikTok settled a lawsuit just before trial was set to begin, avoiding a public court case over allegations that its platform causes social media addiction, particularly among young users. The case was a "bellwether trial" combining hundreds of similar lawsuits against social media companies. The settlement terms were not disclosed. This follows broader legal and regulatory scrutiny of TikTok and other platforms over their design features and algorithms that critics argue exploit psychological vulnerabilities to maximize engagement.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centered on the nature of social media addiction and where responsibility lies. A core philosophical tension emerged between those viewing the problem as individual willpower failure versus systemic manipulation. Liftyee articulated the "free dopamine" critique—that frictionless, algorithmic feeds create harmful incentive structures that trap users in "local minima" rather than pursuing meaningful goals—while sharing their personal mitigation strategy of blocking algorithmic feeds entirely.

Card_zero pushed back with a series of probing questions challenging whether interest itself is problematic, comparing TikTok to pinball as potentially legitimate entertainment. This sparked rebuttals emphasizing the intentional design dimension: Quarrelsome noted these products are engineered for addiction by elite talent, calling the resulting dynamics "enslavement" for ad impressions. The comparison to other vices—cheeseburgers, gambling, drugs—recurred throughout. SunshineTheCat raised parental accountability questions, asking where liability ends and personal responsibility begins, though others countered that social media's unique combination of zero cost, unlimited availability, and psychological precision-engineering distinguishes it from analogies like fast food.

The discussion also surfaced striking personal testimony: one user described losing a year to 12-14 hour daily TikTok usage, explaining how even financial success through the platform paradoxically destroyed their drive and purpose. Others noted TikTok's particular potency relative to competitors, with YouTube characterized as less aggressively optimized for dopamine (despite Shorts' attempt). The exchange revealed generational divides in attitudes—dankwizard's "just put the phone down" dismissal met with addiction science pushback—and ended with questions about why gambling and alcohol face fewer restrictions despite arguably worse harms, suggesting regulatory inconsistency.

## [AISLE’s autonomous analyzer found all CVEs in the January OpenSSL release](https://aisle.com/blog/aisle-discovered-12-out-of-12-openssl-vulnerabilities)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46789913

> **Article:** AISLE, a security company offering an autonomous AI-powered vulnerability analyzer, claims their tool discovered all 12 CVEs in the January 2025 OpenSSL security release before they were publicly disclosed. The company positions this as evidence that AI-driven automated analysis can overcome limitations of manual code review, even in mature, heavily audited codebases. The vulnerabilities included issues dating back to 1998, with severities ranging from low to high, covering buffer overflows, stack overflows, out-of-bounds writes, and cryptographic implementation flaws.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely sidesteps the AI claims to focus on a deeper, more damning consensus: OpenSSL's codebase is notoriously, perhaps irredeemably, terrible. Multiple commenters with direct experience describe it as "beyond horrible to read," "diabolically bad," and "hostile"—with one suggesting it looks almost engineered to hide subtle bugs. A referenced presentation on LibreSSL characterizes the code as so convoluted that tracing any public API to its implementation has become "an exercise in self-flagellation," riddled with indirection, #ifdefs, and optional paths that defeat comprehension.

This isn't merely aesthetic criticism. Commenters note concrete consequences: OpenSSL's CI is "exceptionally flaky" to the point that serious bugs get dismissed as noise—a critical AVX-512 buffer overflow in 2022 was caught by tests but released anyway because failures were routine. The project's tolerance for failing builds persists, with recent commits routinely shipping despite red CI.

The AI angle draws mixed reactions. Some are bullish on automated vulnerability discovery while bearish on AI-generated software; others worry about the asymmetry—if AI finds bugs for defenders, it finds them for attackers too, and at scale. False positives emerge as a practical concern, with maintainers describing AI-generated reports as often "really bad" and costly to triage. A few voices raise skeptical eyebrows about AISLE's marketing incentives, though most accept the findings as plausible given OpenSSL's track record.

Alternatives exist and fare better. BoringSSL, LibreSSL, AWS-LC, WolfSSL, and s2n-tls all get mentions as more maintainable, with BoringSSL notably unaffected by recent OpenSSL advisory waves. Yet OpenSSL remains deeply entrenched. The uncomfortable takeaway threading through the discussion: critical infrastructure software can succeed wildly while being "a garbled mess," and neither market forces nor security imperatives have dislodged it. If anything, the discussion suggests AI's real value here isn't replacing human judgment but finally scaling the grunt work of picking through code that humans have long failed to clean up.
