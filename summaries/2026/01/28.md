## [TikTok users can't upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec)
**Score:** 1381 | **Comments:** 902 | **ID:** 46779809

> **Article:** CNN reports that TikTok users have been unable to upload videos with anti-ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) content, with the company attributing the issue to technical glitches. This comes in the context of TikTok's recent forced sale to US-based ownership under the Biden administration's divestiture law, which was subsequently paused by the Trump administration. The timing raises questions about whether content moderation changes are politically motivated or genuinely technical in nature.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on censorship, propaganda, and the erosion of democratic norms, with commenters drawing parallels between current US developments and historical authoritarian regimes.

Several users framed the TikTok situation within broader geopolitical information warfare. One argued the forced US sale was about hiding information from Americans that others worldwide can access, while another countered that global TikTok content is itself curated by Chinese interests to promote anti-US narratives—particularly in South America, where they claimed the algorithm surfaces content about US government violence while filtering out Tiananmen Square or Tibet material. Others noted the irony that China itself uses a heavily censored domestic version (Douyin), with some observing the US appears to be converging toward similar censorship practices.

The "technical difficulties" explanation triggered historical resonance, particularly among Eastern European commenters. One shared a poignant memory from 1989 Czechoslovakia when state TV claimed "camera broke down" during protest coverage—their father immediately recognized this as suppression of police violence against students. Another expressed nostalgia and dismay that the US, once "as close to a paradise as it gets," appears to be "on a fast track" toward Iron Curtain-era conditions, though acknowledging it's "nowhere near as bad" yet.

The discussion expanded to broader concerns about escalating political violence and democratic backsliding. Commenters referenced ICE agents shooting legal gun owners, IRS politicization, and the Epstein case—where reports emerged that TikTok was allegedly blocking "Epstein" in direct messages. One user warned that weapons built against "currently designated bad people" eventually turn against their creators, while others debated whether algorithmic amplification constitutes genuine free speech when platforms actively curate rather than merely host content.

Some users reported firsthand experience of apparent algorithmic disruption, describing sudden, dramatic shifts in their For You Page recommendations starting around January 26, 2026—as if preferences had been wiped entirely. Others noted this could be "exploration injection," a known engagement tactic, though the timing and persistence struck some as unusual.

The conversation revealed deep pessimism about platform alternatives, with one declaring such apps "mental poison" designed for addiction, while others noted how network effects have made Facebook an enduring "institution" despite earlier assumptions of constant migration between platforms.

## [FBI is investigating Minnesota Signal chats tracking ICE](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041)
**Score:** 779 | **Comments:** 1082 | **ID:** 46783254

> **Article:** The FBI is investigating participants in Minnesota-based Signal group chats used to track and protest ICE activities. According to NBC News reporting, investigators have joined these encrypted chat groups to monitor communications. The investigation centers on whether protesters engaged in criminal conduct beyond protected speech, including allegations of unlawfully scanning license plates of ICE vehicles and potentially receiving insider assistance from government employees. The case highlights tensions between First Amendment protections for political organizing and law enforcement's authority to investigate potential crimes.

## [Prism](https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism)
**Score:** 663 | **Comments:** 402 | **ID:** 46783752

> **Article:** OpenAI has launched "Prism," an AI-powered LaTeX editor and research writing tool. It appears to be a rebranded/evolved version of crixet.com, which OpenAI acquired. The tool integrates AI assistance directly into academic paper writing, including features for generating citations, manipulating LaTeX documents, and collaborative editing—positioning it as a potential competitor to Overleaf, though offered for free.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism and concern about Prism's impact on scientific publishing, alongside criticism of its branding choice. The dominant theme centers on fears that AI-assisted writing tools will flood journals with low-quality "vibe-written" submissions. Journal editor JBorrow articulates this most forcefully, describing how undergraduate students in unrelated fields now submit AI-generated cosmology papers, wasting the time of volunteer reviewers and editors. This concern resonates throughout the thread, with InsideOutSanta drawing parallels to how AI-generated bug reports have degraded bug bounty programs, and jcranmer noting this follows a pattern where LLMs first overwhelmed publisher slush piles and now threaten open source repositories.

Several commenters propose structural solutions. Bloppe suggests refundable submission fees to discourage frivolous submissions, though JBorrow counters that this would harm legitimate researchers from underfunded institutions—a tension that surfaces repeatedly between quality control and accessibility. Others like haspok take an accelerationist stance, arguing that breaking the current peer review system might finally force necessary reform.

The tool's comparison to Overleaf generates practical discussion. Crazygringo and others assess its viability as a free alternative, with concerns about long-term sustainability given remote LaTeX compilation costs. Some users like efficax question the entire category's value, while raincole offers a counterpoint from non-English speaking countries where GPT translation has become standard practice for academic writing.

The naming choice provokes significant controversy. Perseids expresses astonishment that OpenAI would reuse "PRISM," the NSA mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden, calling it especially tone-deaf given deteriorating US-EU digital relations. While some like pageandrew dismiss this as overreaction to a generic term, postalcoder and asveikau affirm the name remains "permanently tainted" for those who remember. Sunaookami darkly suggests this reflects broader community indifference to surveillance revelations, citing HN threads where Snowden is called a Russian asset.

A smaller thread critiques the tool's actual functionality. Ai_critic and olivia-banks highlight problematic demo content showing AI selecting citations for "pageantry" rather than genuine literature review, with olivia-banks sharing experience of removing a co-author for exactly this workflow. Thomasahle offers a rare positive note, finding Prism more responsible than raw ChatGPT use since it requires reviewing changes. The discussion concludes with name collisions—XCSme notes confusion with Prisma ORM, while pazimzadeh points out Prism is already established scientific software from GraphPad.

## [U.S. government has lost more than 10k STEM PhDs since Trump took office](https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office)
**Score:** 521 | **Comments:** 376 | **ID:** 46784263

> **Article:** The article from Science.org reports that the U.S. government has lost more than 10,000 STEM PhD employees since Donald Trump took office. This represents a significant brain drain from federal agencies, with researchers citing funding cuts, hostile immigration policies, and an anti-science political climate as driving factors. The National Science Foundation (NSF) budget faced proposed cuts of 55%, and international collaborations have been severely disrupted. The trend threatens America's long-standing dominance in basic research and technological innovation, with many departing scientists relocating to Europe, Canada, or returning to their home countries.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep divisions about how to interpret this brain drain, with commenters debating whether the loss represents genuine damage or a necessary correction to a broken academic system.

A minority voice, represented by JuniperMesos, challenged the framing that losing STEM PhDs is automatically harmful, arguing that academia produces substantial low-quality research and that credentialism shouldn't drive federal hiring. This provoked strong rebuttals, particularly from ixtli, who countered that there's no evidence the departing researchers were the least productive—if anything, those with the most options likely leave first—and that no valid metric exists to evaluate 10,000 PhDs on a single dimension.

The broader consensus among commenters painted a grim picture of self-inflicted damage. titzer noted the compounding effects of slashed NSF funding and hostile immigration policies making it "harder to recruit PhD students and harder to fund them," concluding that "America is stabbing itself directly in the brain." A European researcher, adev_, offered perhaps the most consequential observation: the void left by terminated US-EU collaborations isn't remaining empty—it's being filled by China, which now hosts ten times more conferences and joint projects than a decade ago. This reframes the brain drain not as simple loss but as active wealth transfer to a geopolitical rival.

Several participants explored the irreversibility of this damage. kevinsync, an American, wondered whether even a complete policy reversal could restore trust, using the vivid metaphor of not wanting "to go back to a bar where the bouncer kicked the shit out of me." detritus and Insanity, both outside observers, suggested the damage extends beyond any single administration. Insanity noted that electing Trump twice reveals something structural about American political culture that allies cannot ignore, while detritus traced the institutional decay back to the 1980s.

The discussion also touched on parallel trends elsewhere—retired noted similar PhD position cuts in the Netherlands, while ixtli highlighted China's massive engineering graduate output. CharlieDigital introduced a cultural framing from a Freakonomics podcast: China is run by engineers who build, while America is run by lawyers who argue and obstruct—a characterization that several found illuminating regardless of one's views on democracy versus autocracy.

Underlying much of the conversation was anxiety about measuring what matters. When zerof1l suggested EU gains might balance US losses, the unspoken rebuttal lingered: scientific collaboration and national competitiveness don't operate as zero-sum games, and the dissolution of the world's most productive research ecosystem serves nobody's long-term interests. The thread closed on a note of pessimism about Western scientific infrastructure generally, with retired describing personal emigration from the Netherlands due to economic unsustainability and warning that brain and wealth drain threatens Europe's social systems.

## [Cloudflare claimed they implemented Matrix on Cloudflare workers. They didn't](https://tech.lgbt/@JadedBlueEyes/115967791152135761)
**Score:** 517 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46781516

> **Article:** A Cloudflare blog post claimed to have "implemented Matrix on Cloudflare Workers"—a fully functional Matrix homeserver running on serverless infrastructure. However, investigation revealed the claim was significantly overstated. The associated GitHub repository (by a Cloudflare Senior Engineering TPM) contained minimal code with only two commits, numerous TODO comments that were hastily removed after criticism, and was clearly AI-generated/vibe-coded rather than production-ready software. The blog post underwent multiple stealth edits to walk back claims, eventually changing from "production grade" to "proof of concept" to "experiment." The code reportedly didn't actually work as a functional Matrix implementation.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community reacted with significant criticism of both the technical implementation and Cloudflare's credibility. Commenters quickly identified red flags: the repository had only two commits, the author removed TODO comments and "production grade" claims from the README as damage control, and the code structure suggested AI generation without proper review. This incident was contextualized within a broader pattern of inflated AI coding claims, coming shortly after Cursor's debunked "browser built from scratch" story.

Several commenters contrasted this with Cloudflare's typically high-quality technical blog posts, expressing disappointment at this departure from their usual standards. The discussion highlighted systemic concerns: whether leadership actually reviews blog posts (contradicting claims that the CEO/CTO personally review all posts), how an unvetted project reached publication, and what this suggests about internal quality controls. The author's role as a Technical Program Manager rather than hands-on engineer drew particular scrutiny, with debate about whether TPMs should be publishing code claims without engineering validation.

The incident sparked wider reflection on how AI-generated content is eroding trust in technical marketing, with suggestions that companies need more rigorous review processes and should simply be precise about capabilities rather than overpromising. One commenter, embedding-shape, demonstrated the point by sharing their own actually-functional browser built with a single AI agent in 20K lines of code—contrasting with both Cloudflare's failed Matrix claim and Cursor's debunked multi-agent browser project.

## [430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/science/archaeology-neanderthals-tools.html)
**Score:** 430 | **Comments:** 226 | **ID:** 46781530

> **Article:** Archaeologists have discovered 430,000-year-old wooden tools in Portugal that represent the oldest well-preserved wooden tools ever found. The tools, attributed to Neanderthals or their ancestors, include digging sticks and a potential thrusting spear, found in waterlogged sediments that enabled exceptional preservation. This find pushes back the known timeline for sophisticated wooden tool use and provides rare direct evidence of a material that typically decomposes quickly in the archaeological record.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion opened with surprise from drakythe, who initially misread the headline as referring to *Homo sapiens* tool use and expressed astonishment at the 430,000-year date. This sparked an informative exchange clarifying that tool use long predates our species—throwup238 explained that the Oldowan stone tool industry dates back 2-3 million years, and that indirect evidence for woodworking (via phytolith and microwear studies) already extends to 1.5 million years ago. The significance of this find, therefore, lies in the exceptional preservation rather than a radical revision of capabilities.

JumpCrisscross introduced a darker thread, citing Jane Goodall's observation that humans, chimpanzees, and wolves share a uniquely genocidal tendency toward extermination rather than mere displacement of rivals. This led to speculation about whether *Homo sapiens*' competitive elimination of other hominid species reflects a broader pattern—one with unsettling implications for the Fermi paradox and dark forest hypotheses about hostile extraterrestrial civilizations. MarcelOlsz and api developed this into existential reflection on humanity's aggressive nature and whether technological advancement inherently selects for territorial, expansionist species.

The conversation briefly attracted pseudoscientific commentary from an0malous promoting Michael Cremo's "Forbidden Archaeology," which claims evidence for million-plus-year-old tools is suppressed by academic dogma. This was met with appropriate skepticism (drakythe noted Cremo's dubious reputation) and a moderator stub, though 3RTB297 offered a nuanced response acknowledging that scientific consensus can indeed resist paradigm-shifting evidence, citing historical examples from plate tectonics to warm-blooded dinosaurs.

A practical tangent emerged around wood's durability, with melenaboija reflecting on how this discovery challenged their assumptions about wood versus stone construction—suggesting Americans' continued reliance on timber framing may be more environmentally sound than European concrete dependence. NoImmatureAdHom countered that this reflects resource availability (America's abundant forests) rather than deliberate choice, while barbacoa noted the irony that modern reinforced concrete's steel rebar doom it to crumble within centuries, unlike ancient Roman unreinforced concrete.

The thread also captured typical HN meta-commentary: eigenspace and wumms noted the original site's collapse under traffic, with wumms providing a NYT mirror, and Salgat observing that even archive.is had cached only the error page.

## [Thief of $90M in seized U.S.-controlled crypto is gov't contractor's son](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/single/lick-theft)
**Score:** 333 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46787521

> **Article:** A government contractor's son stole approximately $90 million in cryptocurrency from U.S. government-controlled wallets containing seized crypto assets. The theft occurred in October 2024 when the contractor's father had a contract with the U.S. Marshals to manage seized crypto holdings. The thief, known online as "Lick," was caught after engaging in a petty dispute with another crypto thief, where they screenshared wallet transfers to prove who was wealthier—revealing a wallet address that crypto investigator zachxbt traced back to the government theft. Despite the evidence, the government reportedly failed to acknowledge the theft occurred until after zachxbt's post went viral. The thief has since publicly mocked investigators and sent small amounts of cryptocurrency to them from the fraudulent wallets.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on multiple layers of institutional failure and corruption. Commenters express shock at the brazenness of the theft and the incompetence of both the government contractor managing the funds and the federal investigators who failed to detect the theft until a civilian crypto sleuth exposed it. The thief's decision to essentially self-dox through livestreaming luxury purchases and taunting investigators—rather than simply disappearing with the money—drew particular attention as a case of criminal hubris undone by ego.

A significant thread of discussion connects this incident to broader concerns about corruption and declining institutional competence in American governance. Several commenters note parallels to the current political climate, with references to pardon-selling, strategic crypto reserves, and the erosion of rule of law. Some debate whether this represents unprecedented corruption or merely newly visible corruption, with one commenter arguing that political self-dealing has long been routine but is now more brazen and user-visible. The specific timing of the theft under the Biden administration, contrasted with speculation about pardons under the Trump administration, generated some partisan friction in the thread.

The discussion also touches on personal losses from government crypto seizures, with commenters sharing experiences of losing access to funds when exchanges were raided. Questions about whether the father was complicit in the theft remain unresolved, though the straightforward nature of connecting the son's public spending to the stolen funds made his involvement seem obvious to many. The overall tone combines dark humor about the absurdity of the situation with genuine alarm about what it reveals about government contracting and asset security.

## [Xfwl4 – The Roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor](https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_15.html)
**Score:** 325 | **Comments:** 245 | **ID:** 46779645

> **Article:** The article outlines the development roadmap for xfwl4, a new Wayland compositor for the Xfce desktop environment intended to replace the existing X11-based xfwm4 window manager. The project aims to maintain Xfce's characteristic lightweight, traditional desktop experience while transitioning to modern display infrastructure. Key technical decisions include using Rust with the Smithay library for building the compositor, which offers memory safety benefits particularly valuable for display server code where crashes are especially disruptive. The roadmap emphasizes behavioral compatibility with xfwm4, though architectural differences between X11 and Wayland present implementation challenges.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on three interwoven tensions: technological transition, userbase expectations, and performance tradeoffs.

**Wayland skepticism versus momentum.** ok123456 voices strong opposition, framing Wayland as a 16-year development quagmire that sacrifices functionality for ideological purity—"a past compromise rather than a future." They criticize its protocol complexity, missing features requiring workarounds, and lack of compelling user-facing benefits. jchw counters with a detailed technical defense: Wayland's compositor-centric design enables proper handling of modern needs (HDR, multi-DPI, docking), its intentional protocol minimalism prevents the ossification that plagued X11, and its security model—while radical—is necessary for contemporary desktop isolation. They acknowledge the "design-by-committee" slowness but argue the results are sound, citing color management as exemplary.

**Xfce userbase characterization.** jchw speculates Xfce's traditionalist users may resist both Wayland and Rust as "complex, bloated, and unnecessary." coldpie, identifying as a 2007-era Xfce user, rejects this: "We want things to just work and not change for no good reason," arguing language choice is irrelevant to actual users and comparing X11 holdouts to SysV-init diehards—vocal but marginal. This exchange reveals a split between perceived and actual user conservatism.

**Performance and architectural constraints.** Fiveplus raises substantive technical concerns about behavioral fidelity—specifically focus-stealing prevention, where X11's permissive client model requires complex heuristics versus Wayland's strict compositor authority—and raw responsiveness on low-end hardware, where xfwm4's optional uncomposited mode historically provided snappiness. jchw confirms mandatory compositing imposes inherent latency tradeoffs, though modern techniques (plane unredirection, high refresh rates) mitigate this. PunchyHamster bluntly states "wayland has been consistently slower than X11," suggesting fundamental limits. The thread thus surfaces an unresolved tension: Wayland's design assumes compositing ubiquity, leaving users of genuinely constrained hardware without clear recourse.

## [Show HN: One Human + One Agent = One Browser From Scratch in 20K LOC](https://emsh.cat/one-human-one-agent-one-browser/)
**Score:** 253 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46779522

> **Project:** A developer ("embedding-shape") built a functional cross-platform browser engine from scratch in 3 days using ~20,000 lines of Rust code, working with a single AI agent (OpenAI's Codex with GPT-5.2). The project imposed strict constraints: no third-party Rust crates, only system libraries, and support for X11, Windows, and macOS. The result is notably compact compared to other recent agent-built browsers (like Cursor's 1.6M line "FastRender"), with ~14K lines for the core engine plus X11 and 6K for Windows/macOS support. The total cost was approximately €19 using ChatGPT Pro's flat-rate subscription. The author, primarily a web developer without prior X11 or native GUI experience, suggests their background in testing, infrastructure, and architecture design helped guide the agent effectively.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on what this project reveals about effective human-AI collaboration versus brute-force agent scaling. Simon Willison and others contrast this lean, single-agent approach favorably against Cursor's much-hyped multi-agent browser project, noting that thoughtful human guidance produced better engineering outcomes than "throwing tokens at a problem." The core insight emerging is that agent *quality* and human direction matter more than agent *quantity*—a finding that challenges assumptions about simply scaling autonomous coding through parallel agents.

Several participants explore the mechanics of successful agent use. Vidarh details a more elaborate autonomous setup involving evaluation agents, research agents, and automatic rollback of unhelpful commits, arguing that "code so cheap it is disposable should change the workflows." Others emphasize scoping strategies: working file-by-file rather than loading entire codebases, leveraging large context windows (400K tokens for GPT-5.2) with intelligent grepping, and maintaining tight human oversight to prevent agents from "going off piste."

Skepticism surfaces briefly—one comment dismisses the feat as unimpressive given browser examples in training data—but is roundly rejected. Willison counters that regurgitation doesn't match observed behavior (thousands of tool calls over three days), and that AI labs actively work to prevent memorization. The exchange highlights a tension in evaluating AI-generated work: the "it's just training data" reflex versus appreciating genuine problem-solving emergence.

The economics draw particular attention. The €19 cost represents "subscription arbitrage" that wouldn't scale via API pricing, raising questions about sustainable access. Meanwhile, experienced developers reflect on historical context—one former KHTML contributor marvels at the compression of what once took months of labor—while newcomers ask how expertise levels affect human-agent pairing. The author themself notes they couldn't have built this alone, lacking systems programming background, suggesting the sweet spot may be knowledgeable generalists guiding capable agents rather than either pure expertise or pure automation.

## [ASML staffing changes could result in a net reduction of around 1700 positions](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation)
**Score:** 248 | **Comments:** 231 | **ID:** 46792370

> **Article:** ASML announced organizational restructuring that will result in a net reduction of approximately 1,700 positions, primarily through eliminating 3,000 of 4,500 engineering manager roles while moving 1,400 of those managers into engineering positions. The company stated this will reduce coordination overhead—currently consuming 35% of engineers' time—and strengthen focus on engineering and innovation. Simultaneously, ASML announced a new €12 billion share buyback program to be executed through December 2028.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community engaged deeply with both the management restructuring and the buyback announcement, though with notably different reactions.

**On the management reduction**, commenters largely praised ASML's move as bold and necessary. skrebbel, who had interviewed with ASML years ago, recalled it as "very engineer-y" and expressed impressed surprise at firing 1,700 managers specifically, suggesting the company had become top-heavy over time. They contrasted this favorably with Philips, ASML's former parent company, which "famously never did anything of the sort" and gradually became management-bloated. This sparked corroborating anecdotes: kabes described how Philips television employees transformed a lean Belgian tech company into a "management top heavy" organization "until nothing worked anymore," while joe_mamba extended this pattern to Siemens spinoffs (Continental, Infineon, Qimonda, Healthineers), noting that only those with major moats like trains or energy survived, while others stagnated or became "financialized hollow shells." zwaps and others validated this as a widespread European corporate pathology, with lnsru offering a visceral firsthand account of management growing from 6 to 17 people post-acquisition, resulting in "meetings about meetings" and "total stagnation." microtonal clarified the mechanics—3,000 manager positions eliminated, 1,400 converted to engineering—and suggested this would make ASML more attractive to engineers, not less.

**On the €12 billion buyback**, reactions were sharply divided. noosphr voiced strong concern: "I've never seen a company that starts doing buybacks not become a financialized hollow shell within a decade," viewing it as particularly troubling for a "near-monopolist." This triggered a technical debate about capital return mechanics. abigail95 defended buybacks as standard profit distribution, prompting articulatepang's detailed three-point explanation of why buybacks are often economically preferable to dividends (tax deferral, portfolio allocation efficiency, and administrative convenience), while acknowledging potential principal-agent conflicts. ArtTimeInvestor countered noosphr's empirical claim by citing Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft as counterexamples doing "tens of billions" in buybacks annually while "firing on all cylinders." ygouzerh questioned timing—buying at market highs—though this too received pushback.

**Underlying tensions** emerged about European versus US corporate culture. Several threads explored why European engineering companies seem prone to management bloat and whether business education or cultural factors explain why German/Dutch conglomerates produce "bloat, inefficiency, bureaucracy and stagnation" while the same staff "flourish" under US companies like Apple. nialv7 and others noted the structural problem of treating management as the only promotion path, with zwaps observing that European companies rarely offer independent contributor tracks equivalent to senior management levels despite US tech demonstrating their viability.

## [Super Monkey Ball ported to a website](https://monkeyball-online.pages.dev/)
**Score:** 248 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46789961

> **Article:** A developer has ported/remade Super Monkey Ball to run in a web browser at monkeyball-online.pages.dev. The project is built in TypeScript and appears to be based on decompilation of the original GameCube game rather than being a pure emulator. The web version includes the core tilt-based ball-rolling gameplay but notably lacks the monkey character inside the ball and some audio elements like the falling scream. The source code is available on GitHub under the name WebMonkeyBall.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion quickly centered on whether the project was AI-generated, with several users suspecting Claude involvement based on code style and the author's admission of being new to web development. However, others pushed back on this assumption, noting the presence of decompilation credits and the manual effort evident in commits. The author clarified on Ko-fi that they used existing community reverse-engineering work, Ghidra decomp output, and documented proprietary formats, describing it as "time consuming but quite easy if you're just patient."

Technical observations dominated much of the thread: users noted the missing monkey and fall screams, control sensitivity differences from the original (attributed to keyboard vs. analog joystick), a gyro permission bug on iOS, and that the game is a remake rather than a direct port. One user submitted a pull request to remove node_modules from the repository, which the author gratefully accepted.

The discussion also touched on broader topics: the historical significance of Super Monkey Ball as a GameCube launch title and early iOS App Store showcase, comparisons to other browser ports like GTA Vice City, and reflections on how web gaming capabilities have evolved (or not) since Steve Jobs' original "web apps" vision for iPhone. Some tension emerged around disclosure of AI assistance, particularly given the author's monetization of the project, though others defended the work as genuinely impressive regardless of methodology.

## [Amazon closing its Fresh and Go stores](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-closing-fresh-grocery-convenience-150437789.html)
**Score:** 242 | **Comments:** 455 | **ID:** 46781444

> **Article:** Amazon is closing its Amazon Fresh grocery stores and Amazon Go convenience stores, exiting its physical grocery retail experiment after years of struggling to compete in the space. The company had invested heavily in "Just Walk Out" technology that promised cashierless shopping, but the initiative failed to gain traction against established competitors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep skepticism about Amazon's grocery strategy, with commenters identifying multiple failure points. A recurring theme is that Amazon approached physical retail with a tech-first mindset that misunderstood the fundamentals of good grocery operations. One frequent shopper described Amazon Fresh as "poorly run" with expired produce on shelves, employees focused on online fulfillment rather than customer service, and no visible management—suggesting Amazon optimized for logistics and automation while neglecting basic retail hygiene.

Several commenters accused Amazon of predatory pricing, noting prices were often dramatically below competitors (avocados at $0.25, pasta at $0.85) as a deliberate strategy to undercut local stores and build market share before raising prices later. This pattern was compared to other Amazon tactics, including allegedly duping a trucker device inventor by cloning his product and selling at a loss until he agreed to list on their platform.

The "Just Walk Out" technology attracted particular scorn after revelations that approximately 1,000 workers in India were manually reviewing transactions rather than AI handling everything—a "fake it till you make it" approach that commenters saw as emblematic of Amazon's hype-over-substance culture. The experience itself proved alienating for some; one user described feeling like a presumed thief under constant surveillance, with invisible "thousand high powered lawyers" watching for any error.

Urban retail dynamics also surfaced as a factor. One New Yorker explained why massive supermarkets like Wegmans appeal in car-dependent areas but fail in dense, walkable neighborhoods where residents prefer specialized local shops (baker, deli, grocer) within blocks of home. Amazon Fresh's location choices often disrupted these ecosystems without replacing their functionality—one Seattle resident noted their store sat empty from 2018-2023, then finally opened only to close again, leaving a grocery desert.

The discussion also touched on labor practices, with observations that Amazon treated cashier roles as "sub-human" by using non-union jobs program workers rather than investing in experienced retail staff. Some commenters defended Amazon's approach to the Just Walk Out technology, arguing that using human review to validate and improve AI models is standard practice, though this view was contested by those who felt the company deliberately misled consumers about the automation level.

Underlying much of the conversation was a sense that Amazon, despite its technical prowess and capital, fundamentally misunderstood physical retail—treating it as a logistics and data problem rather than a customer service and community business. The closures were seen as predictable consequences of this cultural mismatch, with local communities and competitors bearing the costs of Amazon's failed experiments.

This represents a significant retreat from Amazon's physical retail expansion strategy, which had aimed to revolutionize grocery shopping through technology like "Just Walk Out" automated checkout. The closures affect multiple store formats that Amazon had developed and acquired over recent years as part of its effort to compete in the brick-and-mortar retail space.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was minimal and procedural rather than substantive. Multiple users quickly identified this as a duplicate submission, with chrisbolt and ChrisArchitect both pointing to an earlier post (item 46781444) that had already covered the same news. Moderator dang consolidated the discussion by moving comments to the original thread. User bigwheels provided a helpful "macro-expanded" reference to another related discussion at item 46781707 titled "Amazon Closing Fresh and Go Stores" which had 14 comments. The thread essentially functioned as a routing mechanism to direct readers to the primary discussion elsewhere, with no original commentary on the business implications of Amazon's retail retreat.

> **Article:** Clawdbot, a popular open-source AI agent framework with 70k+ GitHub stars, has been renamed to Moltbot following apparent trademark pressure from Anthropic (makers of Claude). The project, created by developer Peter Steinberger, provides an autonomous AI assistant with deep system integration—including macOS control, iMessage access, Gmail, and Telegram—allowing users to automate complex personal and professional tasks. The rename follows reports that "Clawdbot" and even "Clawbot" were rejected due to IP concerns around the "Claude" trademark.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers heavily on security concerns rather than the rename itself. Simon Willison and others describe Moltbot as a "perfect storm" for prompt injection attacks and "lethal trifecta" scenarios—where users grant broad system access, connect sensitive accounts (Gmail, iMessage, banking), and expose the agent to untrusted web content. One commenter demonstrated a successful prompt injection via fake doctor's office email that bypassed Moltbot's safeguards while Google's native Gemini integration blocked the same attack. The "normalization of deviance" pattern worries observers: users who haven't been attacked yet grow increasingly confident in unsafe configurations, with some even buying dedicated Mac Minis for isolation while still connecting them to critical accounts.

Practical security mitigations discussed include LXC containers, air-gapped networks (though this cripples functionality), and guardrail models between the user and LLM—though these add latency and cost. The fundamental tension remains: cutting outbound access renders the tool useless, while permitting internet access enables data exfiltration through reverse proxies or simple instruction-following.

The project's explosive popularity puzzles some commenters. Explanations include Steinberger's extensive CLI integrations and iOS/macOS engineering skills, the entertaining "SOUL.md" personality system, superior underlying architecture using "pi" rather than Claude Code SDK, and viral marketing through crypto-adjacent communities. Skeptics dismiss it as "vibe-coded slop" replicable in a weekend, while defenders note its elegant plain-text configuration system and flexible automation frameworks (cron jobs, heartbeat reminders, approval workflows) that appeal to bloggers, journalists, and automation enthusiasts.

The trademark discussion reveals Anthropic's legal team contacted Steinberger, with speculation that "Clawbot" was also rejected. Commenters share analogous cease-and-desist stories—Kellogg's $15 million lawsuit against a food truck, a brewery's "Unlawful Waffle" rebrand—while debating whether "Moltbot" sacrifices too much brand recognition. Shodan scans already show exposed Moltbot instances on VPSs, though pairing requirements and localhost-only access may limit actual vulnerability. Hardware debates emerge: some advocate cheap NUCs or Raspberry Pis over $600 Mac Minis, while others note iMessage integration still requires macOS somewhere in the stack.

## [The age of Pump and Dump software](https://tautvilas.medium.com/software-pump-and-dump-c8a9a73d313b)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46780065

> **Article:** The article critiques a phenomenon dubbed "Pump and Dump software"—AI-powered coding tools and frameworks that are allegedly being used as vehicles for cryptocurrency speculation rather than genuine technological innovation. The author appears to focus on specific projects like "Gas Town" (an AI coding agent framework by Steve Yegge) and "Clawdbot"/"Moltbot" (an AI assistant tool), suggesting these projects are being promoted through spam networks, astroturfing, and associated crypto token schemes. The core accusation is that the software itself serves as "hype-vehicles" to drive token speculation, with the actual technical merit being secondary to the financial extraction mechanism.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharply divided community grappling with whether these AI coding projects represent genuine experimentation or sophisticated scams. Defenders, led by **Leynos**, frame Gas Town and similar projects as legitimate speculative exploration of nascent AI agent architectures—comparing the "supervisor-worker-merge factory" pattern to distributed systems research and noting that Anysphere arrived at similar designs independently. They emphasize that public experimentation with imperfect technology necessarily produces both successes and failures, and that Steve Yegge explicitly designed Gas Town for users unconcerned with inference costs.

Skeptics, particularly **_pdp_** and **avaer**, present substantial counter-evidence: spam domain backlink networks, coordinated Reddit astroturfing, critical security vulnerabilities in the codebase, suspicious commit patterns suggesting potential backdoor risks, and a rapid rebrand from "Clawdbot" to "Moltbot" following an Anthropic takedown notice. **avaer** draws on insider experience with ~$1B in observed crypto scams, arguing that AI coding tools have simply optimized the "rugpull" playbook by enabling non-technical hype artists to generate plausible software facades faster than victims can evaluate them.

The conversation expands into broader anxieties about software's trajectory. **justonceokay** provocatively asks whether future generations will view this era as computing's "Wild West" or its "Butlerian Jihad" moment—comparing TikTok to 19th-century ether proliferation. **bee_rider** speculates that future RAG AIs will mine today's overcomplicated framework stacks as training data for generating intentionally baroque code. **sergiotapia**'s Star Trek optimism is immediately subverted by **bayarearefugee**'s injection attack scenario, encapsulating the tension between aspirational and adversarial framings of AI progress.

Economic analysis surfaces through **storystarling** and **simoncion**, who debate whether supervisor-worker architectures can achieve viable unit economics given current latency and inference costs. **leggerss** attempts a conceptual separation: the software exploration may have merit even if the attached token schemes are transparent greater-fool traps. **skybrian** and **goinghjuk** note that crypto "investors" now replicate VC dynamics—providing capital for zero equity—while **askl** inverts the critique entirely, calling VC startups "the original pump and dump software" where "successful exit" simply names the dump.

The thread's most unsettling undercurrent is **avaer**'s lament: the genuine technical coolness of AI and crypto tools has been captured by incentive structures that systematically reward exploitation over construction, with social media velocity and regulatory arbitrage ensuring that "normies haven't yet realized they are the suckers at the table."

## [AI2: Open Coding Agents](https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents)
**Score:** 196 | **Comments:** 31 | **ID:** 46783017

> **Article:** AI2 (Allen Institute for AI) has released SERA-32B, the first model in their "Open Coding Agents" series. The model achieves 49.5% on SWE-bench Verified, matching performance of larger models like Devstral-Small-2 (24B). The key differentiator is AI2's "fully open" approach—they release not just open weights and code, but also the complete training data, training pipeline, inference stack, and corpus. This enables reproducibility and further research. The model is a fine-tune of Qwen3-32B, trained at 32K context length (with YARN extension to 64K), and is designed to be deployable locally. AI2 emphasizes that they evaluated without test-time scaling (TTS) to measure raw capability and control for inference cost and memory constraints.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on several technical and philosophical debates about open coding agents. A core tension emerged around what "fully open" actually means—commenters noted that while AI2 releases training data, the base model (Qwen3-32B) isn't reproducible from scratch, making this a partial openness. This sparked comparisons to Meta's CWM models, which achieve higher SWE-bench scores (65% with TTS, 54% without) but don't release training data. AI2's Ethan Shen defended their evaluation methodology, explaining they avoided TTS and limited context length to 32K to focus on deployable, memory-efficient models rather than benchmark-optimized configurations.

Practical questions about fine-tuning dominated another thread. One commenter working on "the biggest codebase in the world" reported disappointing results from their fine-tuned model, finding that 99% of useful patterns could be gleaned from nearby context anyway. Others agreed that intelligent context management with frontier models often outperforms fine-tuning, though some noted fine-tuning's potential value for speed (less "research" time) and specialized domains with unique in-house patterns.

Several commenters caught apparent errors in AI2's claims: incorrectly stating their model was "smaller" than Devstral-Small-2-24B when it's actually 32B vs 24B, and mischaracterizing Devstral as "closed-weight" when it's openly available. The authors acknowledged and promised to fix these. Others questioned whether this model offers anything beyond existing options like gpt-oss-20b, which achieves higher scores at smaller sizes.

The broader significance of "fully open" approaches generated mixed reactions. Some celebrated this as advancing reproducible research, while others saw irony in OpenAI having "stopped the trend" of openness. Practical deployment questions arose—availability on OpenRouter, cost comparisons to LoRA-based tuning methods, and whether the system still requires Claude for actual use. The discussion reflects ongoing uncertainty about where value accrues in the AI stack: base model capabilities, fine-tuning techniques, context engineering, or agent harnesses.

## [Time Station Emulator](https://github.com/kangtastic/timestation)
**Score:** 185 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46786183

> **Article:** A web-based emulator that transmits WWVB time signals (the 60 kHz atomic clock broadcast from Colorado) through a computer's audio output, allowing radio-controlled clocks to sync without needing the actual long-range radio signal. The project exploits harmonic frequencies generated by DACs during audio playback, which leak as short-range radio transmissions via the physical wires and circuit traces in the audio output path.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded with a mix of awe at the clever physics exploitation and practical experimentation. Several users immediately drew connections to Van Eck phreaking from 1982, noting that using unintended electromagnetic emissions from hardware has a long history—modern sensitive receivers just make such techniques more accessible. Others compared it to similarly surprising hardware hacks like turning hard drives into microphones.

The technical mechanism sparked particular fascination: one commenter quoted the project's explanation that DAC harmonics recreate the original fundamental frequency, which then radiates from audio cables acting as ad-hoc antennas. Some expressed humbling admiration ("Sometimes I think I'm a smart guy…and then I read of people doing shit like this"), while others with relevant background found the logical leap reasonable given knowledge of RF principles.

Practical testing yielded mixed results. Several users successfully synced clocks and watches, including one who finally synchronized six Casio watches after a decade of struggles using a commercial iOS alternative called Clock Wave. Others encountered partial syncs (hours and seconds but not minutes), timezone confusion, or complete failures depending on device and browser combinations. The slow data rate—1 bit per second with no error correction, requiring full minute-long transmissions—means synchronization can take several minutes and suffers from interference from ubiquitous switch-mode power supplies.

Nostalgia emerged as a secondary theme, with users reminiscing about falling asleep to WWV/WWVB's distinctive droning on shortwave radios, and one recalling a high school TI-84 calculator project attempting the same feat. The discussion also touched on the signal's uncertain future—NIST has considered retiring WWVB given GPS and internet alternatives, though legacy equipment and public outcry have preserved it thus far. This emulator potentially offers a transition path if the broadcast eventually ceases.

A darker undercurrent of concern appeared briefly: one user worried about malicious time-spoofing attacks becoming trivial now that working code sits on Hacker News' front page, though others dismissed this as catastrophizing. Relatedly, commenters noted similar low-frequency RF exploits against shopping cart wheel locks, with links to proof-of-concept demonstrations from 2008.

## [SoundCloud Data Breach Now on HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/SoundCloud)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46782930

> **Article:** SoundCloud has disclosed a data breach affecting approximately 29.8 million user accounts (about 20% of its userbase), now listed on Have I Been Pwned. The compromised data includes email addresses, names, usernames, avatars, follower/following counts, and in some cases, country information. SoundCloud emphasized that no passwords or financial data were exposed, characterizing most of the breached data as "information already visible on public SoundCloud profiles." However, the critical issue is that the breach enabled attackers to map publicly visible profile data to private email addresses—connecting dots that weren't previously linked. The incident was discovered in December 2025.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals significant user frustration with SoundCloud that extends well beyond the breach itself. Several commenters shared negative experiences with the platform's business practices, particularly around account downgrades. One longtime user described how canceling a paid "Artist Pro" subscription led to their music being hidden and eventually threatened with deletion—a practice others defended as standard freemium mechanics, though the original commenter noted the hostility toward *former* paying customers specifically.

Technical criticism of SoundCloud's current state featured prominently. One user attempting to return to the platform encountered confusing upload limits that seemed to contradict documented free tier allowances, suspecting "chaos" in their microservices architecture where "some system overrides the limits." This joined complaints about spam accounts offering fake listeners, interface "jankiness," and controversial Terms of Service changes permitting ML training on user uploads.

Regarding the breach specifically, debate emerged over its actual severity. Some initially dismissed it as merely "scraped public data," but others clarified that the critical vulnerability was the linkage between public profiles and private email addresses—enabling identification of pseudonymous users. One commenter illustrated this risk humorously: "Person A, who is known to use email address X, kept Lost Prophets as one of their liked artists even after 2013!" This doxxing-adjacent risk was underscored by another user sharing a harrowing account of having their SoundCloud-adjacent identity exploited to compromise multiple email accounts despite two-factor authentication.

The discussion also touched on data privacy regulations, with questions about GDPR implications, and practical security advice—emphasizing unique passwords and email aliases. Several users expressed relief at having deleted their accounts previously, with one noting satisfaction that their data no longer appeared in the breach. The conversation concluded with nostalgic references to SoundCloud's cultural significance as a launchpad for artists like Lil B, Post Malone, and Billie Eilish, contrasted with its apparent decline in user trust and technical reliability.

## [TikTok settles just before social media addiction trial to begin](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24g8v6qr1mo)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 190 | **ID:** 46786237

> **Article:** TikTok and its parent company ByteDance settled a lawsuit just before trial was set to begin, avoiding a court case over allegations that the platform's design intentionally addicted children and harmed their mental health. The lawsuit, brought by a Kentucky teenager, was a bellwether case combining hundreds of similar claims against social media companies. While settlement terms weren't disclosed, the case was significant as it would have tested legal theories about platform liability for addictive design features. Google is also named in related litigation, with trials scheduled for later in 2025.
