## [TikTok users can't upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec)
**Score:** 1260 | **Comments:** 845 | **ID:** 46779809

> **Article:** CNN reports that TikTok users have been unable to upload videos with anti-ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) content, with the company attributing the issue to technical problems. This comes amid broader concerns about content moderation on the platform following its forced sale to US-based ownership under the Biden administration's divestiture law, which was later supported by the Trump administration. The timing raises questions about whether "technical glitches" are being used to suppress politically sensitive content.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals deep skepticism about TikTok's explanation, with multiple users drawing historical parallels to state censorship disguised as technical failures. One commenter shared a poignant personal story from 1989 Czechoslovakia, where state TV claimed "camera broke down" to avoid showing police violence against protesters—a pattern now echoed in claims of "tech issues."

Several threads explore the geopolitical dimensions of TikTok's ownership and algorithm. Some argue the forced US sale aims to hide information Americans can otherwise access, while others contend the platform already functions as sophisticated propaganda—filtering out content about Tiananmen Square and Tibet while amplifying criticism of US foreign policy in regions like South America. The observation that "the most brutally honest propaganda is always the most effective" captured significant attention.

The conversation evolved into broader debates about platform control and political hypocrisy. Commenters noted rapid changes following the ownership transition, including reports that "Epstein" was being blocked in DMs and sudden algorithmic resets that wiped user preferences. Some framed this as an "Orbanisation" of TikTok—referencing Hungary's media capture—happening with alarming speed because the technical infrastructure for censorship was already built.

Political divisions surfaced around free speech, deplatforming, and whose censorship counts as legitimate. Several users observed that both left and right have supported content suppression when targeting their opponents, with one noting "once the tables turn, it will be your turn." The discussion concluded with pessimism about platform alternatives, with one user dismissing TikTok-like apps as "mental poison" designed for addiction rather than genuine discourse.

## [FBI is investigating Minnesota Signal chats tracking ICE](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041)
**Score:** 536 | **Comments:** 661 | **ID:** 46783254

> **Article:** The NBC News article reports that the FBI is investigating Signal group chats used by activists in Minnesota to track and monitor ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) activities. The investigation centers on protesters who have been coordinating efforts to locate ICE vehicles and agents, with particular scrutiny on whether participants may have had unauthorized access to law enforcement databases to obtain license plate information. The probe raises questions about the line between constitutionally protected protest activity and potential criminal conduct.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around several interconnected themes: the constitutional boundaries of protest and surveillance, the technical vulnerabilities of encrypted communication tools, and broader concerns about governmental overreach and accountability.

A central tension in the debate concerns whether tracking ICE activities constitutes protected speech or crosses into illegal territory. Commenter bediger4000 frames this as "unequivocally constitutionally protected speech," while tptacek offers a more legally grounded perspective, noting that while prosecution for speech is barred, investigation rights are far narrower and essentially vanish when the FBI already possesses relevant data through arrests or confidential informants. This distinction between protection from prosecution versus protection from investigation becomes a recurring thread.

The technical discussion focuses on Signal's privacy model. Several participants, including ddtaylor and charliebwrites, explore how phone number metadata—Signal's primary exposed data point—can become a critical vulnerability: identify one participant, compel device unlock, and potentially access group chat contents. SR2Z and others counter that modern device encryption and passcodes provide substantial protection, suggesting the more likely vector is human compromise rather than technical defeat. The xkcd 538 reference (the "wrench attack" comic) surfaces as a darkly humorous acknowledgment that physical coercion often trumps cryptographic security.

A significant subthread examines allegations that protesters unlawfully scanned or ran license plates through restricted databases. Andreygrehov cites reports suggesting insider help, while janalsncm and derbOac push back—questioning whether this couldn't simply be crowdsourced observation of publicly visible plates, and challenging the very notion of "unlawful" plate scanning when photography and database access are widely available. Janalsncm extends this to a broader critique: "In a free society law enforcement should clearly identify themselves as such. We should not need secret police."

The political framing varies sharply across commenters. Therobots927 declares "The fascists won," while jatora defends investigation as legitimate protection of law enforcement from "vigilante justice." Chinathrow and epistasis pivot to criticize ICE itself, with epistasis providing specific documentation of DoJ attorney resignations over blocked investigations into ICE shootings—allegations redirected instead toward victims' families. This "through the looking glass" characterization captures a sense of institutional inversion that resonates with several participants.

Palantir's role surfaces as both feared and dismissed. Hedayet warns of rapid action enabled by "predatory tech," but crystal_revenge—drawing on government experience—argues Palantir is likely overhyped, and that governmental incompetence may paradoxically protect against dystopian efficiency. This "incompetence as safety" thesis finds partial agreement, though Eupolemos counters with the Snowden precedent: "reality blew away our imagination."

The discussion closes with statutory specifics (mycodendral citing 18 U.S.C. § 372 on conspiracy to impede officers), practical security advice (craftkiller recommending GrapheneOS Before First Unlock), and sobering reminders about judicial abdication—mrtesthah's warning that "any judge that doesn't immediately reject such cases on a first-amendment basis is doing the business of an authoritarian dictator."

## [Cloudflare claimed they implemented Matrix on Cloudflare workers. They didn't](https://tech.lgbt/@JadedBlueEyes/115967791152135761)
**Score:** 474 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 46781516

> **Article:** A Mastodon post by JadedBlueEyes alleges that Cloudflare's blog post claiming to have "implemented Matrix on Cloudflare Workers" is misleading or false. The accusation centers on a GitHub repository (nkuntz1934/matrix-workers) created by a Cloudflare Senior Engineering TPM, which appears to be low-quality, possibly AI-generated code presented as a production-ready implementation. Evidence cited includes: only two commits in the repository's history, removal of TODO comments in a suspicious "cleanup" commit, and claims of being "production grade" that were later removed. The situation draws parallels to other recent debunked AI coding claims, particularly Cursor's browser-building story.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep skepticism about both this specific incident and broader trends in AI-generated technical content. Commenters quickly identified red flags in the repository: biohazard2 noted the developer removed all TODO comments in a cleanup commit, while bob1029 pointed to the highly suspicious two-commit history as a heuristic for non-serious projects. The discussion evolved to draw explicit parallels with Cloudflare's previous OAuth library for Workers, which was marketed as "thoroughly reviewed by security experts" and "not vibe coded" yet later had a published security advisory (GHSA-4pc9-x2fx-p7vj).

The timing resonated strongly—rideontime connected this to the recent debunking of Cursor's web browser claims, suggesting "disbelief should be the default reaction" to such stories. This prompted an interesting tangent where embedding-shape, who had written the original Cursor exposé, shared their own successful experiment building a functional browser with just one AI agent in 20K lines of code, demonstrating what genuine AI-assisted development can look like.

Multiple commenters analyzed the organizational failure modes. ampersandy offered a charitable interpretation: an individual "vibe-coded" both post and repository, publishing to the Cloudflare blog without proper engineering review. This raised concerns about Cloudflare's review processes, with themafia asking what else this employee might be "vibe coding" and referencing Cloudflare's history of major outages. The revelation that Cloudflare's CEO and CTO personally review blog posts (per babelfish) made the situation more damning—suggesting either complicity or inadequate technical scrutiny at the highest levels.

The repository author, identified as a Senior Engineering TPM, became a focal point for criticism about non-engineers presenting experimental code as production systems. Fokamul's dismissive comment about "smelly nerds" captured the tension, while others debated whether TPMs constitute management and what technical accountability should look like.

augusteo articulated the reputational damage: technical blogs from infrastructure companies traditionally built expertise and trust, but "we did X" posts that turn out to be "we did a demo of part of X" erode both. Cloudflare's subsequent edits to the blog post—first adding a "proof of concept" disclaimer while keeping contradictory claims about "real encrypted communications," then removing even that—only deepened the credibility crisis. ncruces documented this evolving damage control, while renyicircle noted further commits removing "production grade" language and adding AI assistance disclosures.

The discussion concluded with broader reflections on AI in software engineering. btown argued this illustrates why software engineering isn't being replaced by AI soon: reviewers need to identify relevant context when things go wrong, whether code is human or AI-written. PUSH_AX countered that human involvement doesn't guarantee security, but parliament32 emphasized the core issue was deception, not merely technical failure. The incident was widely seen as symptomatic of pressure to demonstrate AI capabilities that outpace reality, with ethin suggesting shareholders and CEOs demand such demonstrations regardless of actual readiness.

## [U.S. government has lost more than 10k STEM PhDs since Trump took office](https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office)
**Score:** 465 | **Comments:** 332 | **ID:** 46784263

> **Article:** The article from Science.org reports that the U.S. government has lost more than 10,000 STEM PhD employees since President Trump took office. This represents a significant brain drain from federal agencies, driven by funding cuts (including a reported 55% reduction to the NSF budget), hostile immigration policies affecting foreign researchers, and broader anti-intellectual policy directions. The loss encompasses researchers across multiple federal agencies who have either left for other countries or left government service entirely.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a stark divide between those questioning whether the loss is inherently harmful and those warning of severe long-term consequences for American scientific leadership.

**The "quality vs. quantity" debate** opened with JuniperMesos arguing that not all STEM PhDs produce valuable work, given academia's broken incentive structures—an uncontroversial view among many academics. However, ixtli and Retric countered that losing 10,000 people cannot be reduced to individual performance questions; at scale, this represents systemic damage, with the most talented likely departing first due to having alternatives. Ixtli further noted the impossibility of measuring 10,000 PhDs on a single productivity dimension, making any "culling" argument unprovable.

**Funding and recruitment collapse** emerged as a central theme. Titzer highlighted the NSF's 55% budget cut and anti-foreigner policies making it "harder to recruit PhD students and it's harder to fund them"—a claim challenged by guywithahat on economic grounds, though the rebuttal ignored the dual constraint of reduced funding *and* reduced international talent pools.

**Geopolitical realignment** drew particular concern from European researcher adev_, who observed that terminated U.S.-EU collaborations are being filled by China, which now hosts 10x more conferences and joint projects than a decade prior. This "void" theory—science abhorring both vacuum and underfunding—suggested Trump's policies directly benefit America's primary strategic competitor. Ixtli reinforced this with data showing China graduating 1.3 million engineers annually, orders of magnitude above U.S. rates.

**Irreversibility and trust erosion** surfaced in kevinsync's question about whether a policy reversal could recover lost talent ("I sure wouldn't want to go back to a bar where the bouncer kicked the shit out of me"). Outsiders detritus and Insanity responded pessimistically: the U.S. has "poisoned its well," with damage extending beyond any single administration since American voters have twice endorsed nationalist leadership, suggesting ~50% support for such directions. Insanity's historical comparison to Caesar's Rubicon crossing underscored fears of institutional collapse.

**Broader Western decline** appeared in retired's personal account of leaving the Netherlands due to economic infeasibility, with pessimism about sustaining social systems amid brain and wealth drain—though surgical_fire contested whether conditions had truly deteriorated so dramatically.

The discussion concluded with ixtli's observation that government funding historically drives the most consequential breakthroughs (NASA, internet, mRNA), making this retreat particularly alarming, while zerof1l offered the cold consolation that EU gains from U.S. losses.

## [Kimi Released Kimi K2.5, Open-Source Visual SOTA-Agentic Model](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html)
**Score:** 462 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46775961

> **Article:** Moonshot AI has released Kimi K2.5, an open-source multimodal AI model with 1 trillion total parameters (32 billion active). It achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual and agentic tasks, including cracking the 50th percentile on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark. The model uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture and is released under a modified MIT license that requires prominent display of "Kimi K2.5" for commercial products with 100M+ MAU or $20M+ monthly revenue.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centered on three main themes: hardware requirements for running the model, the strategic rationale behind open-sourcing such an expensive model, and technical capabilities around agentic workflows.

On hardware, commenters debated whether the model is genuinely runnable "at home." While technically possible through MoE architecture (only 32B parameters active at once, ~16GB at int4), practical deployments range widely: from budget setups streaming from SSD or using system RAM with older GPUs, to $20K dual Mac Studio configurations (per Simon Willison), to $70-100K server setups for production agentic use, up to $500K+ for serious 16xH100 deployments. A key tension emerged between "technically runs" and "actually usable"—quantized versions may sacrifice significant capability, raising questions about whether users would be better served by appropriately-sized unquantized models.

The open-source strategy sparked geopolitical speculation. Multiple commenters framed this as China's answer to DeepSeek—using open collaboration to erode US AI leadership regardless of immediate revenue. The modified MIT license's attribution requirement was compared to Google's early search widget strategy for brand building, with some seeing it as clever marketing and others as a thinly-veiled payment demand. Skeptics questioned whether anyone actually uses these open Chinese models in practice, suggesting the hype may exceed adoption.

On capabilities, the "agent swarm" feature drew attention—K2.5 can orchestrate up to 100 sub-agents with 1,500 parallel tool calls, achieving 80% latency reduction. Commenters clarified this works through tool-calling orchestration rather than internal model mechanisms, with parallels drawn to existing patterns like Claude's "secret swarm mode" and Gas Town's infrastructure. Some expressed skepticism about unit economics at that scale, while others saw it as genuine innovation in RL-trained agent orchestration.

## [Prism](https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism)
**Score:** 436 | **Comments:** 267 | **ID:** 46783752

> **Article:** OpenAI announced "Prism," a new AI-powered tool for creating scientific papers. The tool appears to be a LaTeX-based document editor with AI assistance features, including automated bibliography generation and citation suggestions. It was previously available as an independent service called Crixet.com, which OpenAI has now acquired or integrated. The tool is currently free to use, positioning it as a potential competitor to Overleaf, the dominant collaborative LaTeX editor. The announcement video emphasized features like finding and adding relevant citations to papers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion around OpenAI's Prism reveals deep skepticism and concern across multiple dimensions, with particular alarm from those working in academic publishing.

**The "Vibe Coding" Crisis in Science Publishing**

The most substantive critique came from JBorrow, a journal editor and reviewer, who described how AI tools like Prism are already flooding academic journals with low-quality "vibe-coded" submissions. They recounted receiving a paper on cosmology from an undergraduate accounting student—entirely AI-generated—that wasted valuable reviewer time. Scientific peer review operates on volunteer labor, and the lowered barrier to entry is creating a tragedy of the commons where CV-padding spam drowns legitimate research. JBorrow pushed back against the framing that writing papers is the hard part of science; the real challenge has always been understanding research context and producing novel work, which AI doesn't solve.

This concern resonated widely. InsideOutSanta drew a parallel to bug bounties being overwhelmed by AI-generated reports, coining a dark observation: "We're truly living in a post-scarcity society now, except that the thing we have an abundance of is garbage, and it's drowning out everything of value." Others noted this pattern has already destroyed publisher slush piles and is now hitting open source repositories.

Proposed solutions included bloppe's refundable submission fees—charging authors deposits that are only returned upon acceptance—but JBorrow noted their journal follows "diamond open access" principles (no fees whatsoever) specifically to enable participation from underfunded researchers globally, making this approach ethically fraught.

**Technical Comparisons and Practical Concerns**

Several commenters evaluated Prism against Overleaf, the incumbent collaborative LaTeX platform. Vitalnodo traced Prism's origins to Crixet.com, noting it had offered more generous compilation limits and sharing options than Overleaf, though with concerning signs that AI features may become mandatory. Crazygringo, who self-hosts Overleaf to avoid its $21/month fee, wondered whether Prism could serve as a viable free alternative—while expressing doubt about OpenAI's long-term commitment to maintaining what is essentially a loss-leader service.

The collaborative features that make Overleaf essential for many research teams were highlighted: simultaneous editing, commenting, revision history, and crucially, removing the need for non-technical academics to manage Git workflows or local TeX installations. For some, like crazygringo, Overleaf's quasi-WYSIWYG visual editor is indispensable for productive writing.

**Naming and Cultural Blind Spots**

Multiple commenters found the "Prism" name problematically tone-deaf. The obvious association is with the NSA's mass surveillance program exposed by Edward Snowden—a connection that postalcoder found "permanently tainted" even if OpenAI calculated that 13 years had dulled public memory. Others noted additional naming collisions: GraphPad Prism, widely used scientific software, and Prisma (the database ORM). The pattern suggested either deliberate provocation or, more likely, a team disconnected from both security history and existing scientific tooling.

**Deeper Questions About Scientific Writing**

The discussion touched on fundamental tensions in academic workflows. Markbao and others questioned whether LaTeX itself—finicky, markup-heavy—represents the future of publishing, with one lab manager claiming Word users proved more productive. Academic respondents defended LaTeX's reliable formatting and version control advantages, while acknowledging its learning curve. Hatmatrix suggested markdown and org-mode as potential abstraction layers.

Perhaps most tellingly, ai_critic observed that OpenAI's own demo video spent substantial time on "finding papers to decorate the bibliography with"—not identifying relevant literature to genuinely engage with, but surface-level citation padding. This crystallized fears that Prism optimizes for the appearance of scholarship rather than its substance, a tool designed for students who "need to throw together a bachelor's thesis" rather than advance knowledge.

## [430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/science/archaeology-neanderthals-tools.html)
**Score:** 351 | **Comments:** 197 | **ID:** 46781530

> **Article:** A New York Times article reports the discovery of 430,000-year-old wooden tools in Germany, identified as the oldest well-preserved wooden tools ever found. These artifacts, attributed to Neanderthals, predate Homo sapiens and demonstrate sophisticated woodworking capabilities including splitting, scraping, and smoothing wood. The exceptional preservation occurred due to waterlogged conditions that prevented decay. The find pushes back direct evidence of wooden tool construction by hundreds of thousands of years, though indirect evidence of woodworking extends back much further.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion opened with surprise at the 430,000-year date, with user drakythe expressing confusion since this predates Homo sapiens. Several commenters clarified that tool use extends millions of years back, with Oldowan stone tools dating to 2-3 million years ago. User throwup238 noted that wooden tools rarely survive, making this find remarkable for preservation rather than capability—phytolith and microwear studies already showed woodworking at 1.5 million years ago.

A tangent emerged when JumpCrisscross invoked Jane Goodall's observation about "genocidal tendencies" in humans, chimpanzees, and wolves, speculating that humans may have exterminated other hominid species who were more willing to share resources. This sparked debate: crazygringo contested this as unsupported generalization, noting genocide is exceptional rather than typical human behavior, while MarcelOlsz found the framing depressing. Moderator dang flagged this subthread as off-topic.

The site experienced traffic overload, prompting mirror links and an Imgur album of images. User melenaboija reflected on wood's durability, reassessing European versus American construction practices, with barbacoa noting how modern concrete's iron rebar causes eventual failure unlike Roman concrete.

A fringe perspective appeared from an0malous, citing Michael Cremo's "Forbidden Archaeology" and claiming evidence of million-year-old tools is suppressed by scientific "dogma." This drew skepticism—drakythe found Cremo's reputation concerning, while lmf4lol asked why such information would be suppressed. User 3RTB297 offered a nuanced response about institutional inertia in science, listing historical examples of delayed acceptance (plate tectonics, warm-blooded dinosaurs, germ theory, quantum mechanics) where career incentives favor incremental over revolutionary claims. However, mmooss pushed back, noting that archaeology regularly revises timelines and that tool use at 2.5+ million years is already mainstream consensus, making "suppression" claims unfounded. Hikikomori defended standard scientific skepticism as proper methodology rather than conspiracy.

## [I made my own Git](https://tonystr.net/blog/git_immitation)
**Score:** 332 | **Comments:** 149 | **ID:** 46778341

> **Article:** The author built a simplified version control system called "tvc" (Tony's Version Control) from scratch in Rust to understand Git's internals. The project implements core Git concepts: content-addressable storage using SHA-256 hashes, tree objects for directory structures, commit objects with parent references, and compressed blob storage using zstd. The author chose YAML for human-readable object serialization and implemented basic commands like init, add, commit, and log. The writeup explains key design decisions and trade-offs, acknowledging performance shortcuts like recomputing file hashes on every operation rather than using caching or timestamps.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion branched into several interconnected threads. A meta-commentary emerged early about the circular nature of AI training—one user noted that articles like this likely feed coding agents' training data, prompting the author to share that his repository was cloned 49 times by 28 unique users before he even published the article, suggesting automated scraping for LLM training. This sparked dark humor about "poisoning" training data with self-referential loops and deliberate bugs, alongside more sober observations that AI crawlers also target self-hosted Gitea instances.

The technical discussion covered merge strategies and alternatives to Git. One user praised Git's underappreciated recursive merge strategy for remembering conflict resolutions without rerere, while others advocated for Pijul's approach of treating conflicts as first-class objects. Several commenters brought up Fossil SCM, which uses SQLite for storage—a suggestion also made independently for the author's project. The author expressed interest in Fossil's design choices, and users shared experiences: some appreciated its local-first nature and integrated ticketing/wiki features, but noted the friction of switching away from Git's ecosystem dominance.

Performance and architectural choices drew scrutiny. A commenter flagged the O(n) hash recomputation on every status check as problematic for large repositories, prompting the author to acknowledge this lazy implementation. The choice of SHA-256 over faster alternatives like BLAKE3 was debated, with one user noting ARM64's native SHA-256 acceleration while another advocated for Content Defined Chunking to parallelize hashing of large files. The use of YAML over TOML was questioned given the Rust context, though the author defended it as an internal format users never manually edit.

The thread closed with obligatory mentions of Jujutsu (jj) as a modern Git-compatible alternative, and philosophical observations about Git's storage layer being flexible enough to support alternative frontends without abandoning the ecosystem. Throughout, the tone balanced genuine appreciation for educational reimplementations with pragmatic skepticism about reinventing version control given Git's entrenched network effects.

## [Celebrities say they are being censored by TikTok after speaking out against ICE](https://www.pride.com/culture/celebrities/tiktok-censoring-megan-stalter-and-finneas)
**Score:** 328 | **Comments:** 216 | **ID:** 46777652

> **Article:** The linked Pride.com article reports that celebrities including Megan Stalter and Finneas (Billie Eilish's brother) have alleged their TikTok content about ICE raids and immigration enforcement is being suppressed or censored. The claims center on unexplained drops in video views, reduced reach, and apparent throttling of content critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement following TikTok's ownership transition to a US-based entity controlled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a prominent Trump supporter. The article frames this as part of broader concerns about political censorship on the platform after its forced sale from ByteDance.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion quickly became polarized around whether this represented genuine platform manipulation, algorithmic unpredictability, or politically motivated flagging of the submission itself. Several users noted the post had been flagged, with iceflinger questioning why a major platform ownership change with apparent functionality impacts wouldn't warrant tech community discussion. Dudefeliciano and saubeidl suggested flagging reflected discomfort among government supporters, with saubeidl describing a "proto-fascist contingent" suppressing regime-critical discussion.

The technical analysis split between competing explanations. Baxtr, drawing on video platform experience, cautioned that algorithmic behavior is inherently difficult to predict—what appears as censorship could simply be "The Algorithm." Scotty79 countered that ICE opposition polls as minority but substantial, making algorithmic suppression of such content among progressive-leaning celebrity audiences unlikely. Mrtksn and others pointed to documented collusion between tech billionaires and the current political administration, suggesting intentional throttling wouldn't be surprising given the acquisition's political context.

A significant thread examined the Ellison family's rapid influence over TikTok, with jauntywundrkind criticizing the Supreme Court's unanimous decision enabling the forced sale and predicting "endless utterly preposterous censorship and algorithmic biasing for the right wing ultra capitalist agenda." This sparked a semantic debate when 0x3f mocked the framing, leading tormeh to characterize the arrangement as closer to mercantilism than pure capitalism given heavy government involvement.

The conversation repeatedly returned to HN's own moderation dynamics. Thunky lamented the absence of genuine cross-ideological discourse anywhere online, blaming downvote-as-disagreement mechanics for creating echo chambers. Colpabar offered 4chan as a counterintuitive alternative—anonymous, unvoted, messy but occasionally substantive—while archagon argued threaded, vote-based systems are fundamentally incompatible with mind-changing dialogue. Several commenters defended ICE directly (ap99) or dismissed celebrity complaints (deanc, BoredPositron), with libertine pushing back that reduced celebrity reach likely signals broader suppression affecting ordinary users documenting enforcement actions.

Practical workarounds drew mixed responses: rvnx suggested Chinese TikTok (Douyin), while vanviegen questioned whether any large-audience platform could resist US government pressure. Theshrike79 split the difference, proposing both "incompetence" (Oracle infrastructure issues) and "malice" (intentional content scanning) remained plausible. Throughout, the absence of transparent algorithmic data—SilverElfin emphasized no platform makes this available—left participants relying on anecdotal pattern-matching that confirmed their existing political frameworks.

## [A list of fun destinations for telnet](https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm)
**Score:** 290 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46775135

> **Article:** The linked article is a curated list of "fun destinations for telnet" at telnet.org, featuring various text-based services accessible via the telnet protocol. These include ASCII art animations (most notably the famous Star Wars ASCII animation at towel.blinkenlights.nl), MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), BBS systems, and other retro computing experiences. The list serves as a nostalgic tour of internet history, showcasing services that have remained operational for decades despite telnet's obsolescence for secure communications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion around this telnet destinations list blends warm nostalgia with technical depth and contemporary concerns. Many commenters share fond memories of discovering telnet through the iconic Star Wars ASCII animation at towel.blinkenlights.nl, describing it as feeling like "discovering a secret passage in the internet." Several users recount how telnet served as an educational gateway—learning email protocols by hand-crafting POP3 commands, building first email clients and web servers after understanding HTTP through raw telnet sessions.

The Star Wars server's status generated some confusion and debate. Multiple users reported it unreachable, with one lamenting "RIP towel.blinkenlights.nl," while others—including someone claiming to know the creator—insisted it remains operational on both IPv4 and IPv6, with the IPv6 version even having "some additions." This sparked discussion about network configuration issues and the fragility of relying on decades-old infrastructure.

A notable tension emerged between romanticizing these "pure" text interfaces and practical reality. One frustrated commenter dismissed the Star Wars server as overexposed after fifteen to twenty years of being the default example, arguing that "real gems" like SDF.ORG, TWENEX.ORG, and Cray 1 supercomputer access deserve more attention. This same commenter offered a surprising professional perspective: telnet remains actively used daily inside telecom networks as one of few ways to communicate with base station controllers, RNCs, and even fresh 5G basebands—all over IP-SEC and isolated networks. They noted audit teams value telnet for recording complete sessions of engineers' work.

The conversation touched on modern accessibility problems—telnet clients are no longer installed by default on most systems, requiring users to actively seek out packages like inetutils-telnet. One commenter provided a complete Python telnet client implementation using telnetlib3 as a workaround. Security concerns also surfaced, with warnings that ANSI escape sequences can pose real dangers including remote code execution through terminal emulator vulnerabilities, though others questioned whether this attack surface genuinely exceeds that of JavaScript in browsers.

MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) received significant attention as living relics, with users confirming 35-year-old games like BatMUD remain playable. Stories emerged of MUDding's educational value—teaching programming—alongside its destructive potential for academic performance. One commenter nearly didn't graduate due to MUD addiction; another never finished their degree.

The discussion concluded with both earnest and playful speculation about text-based protocols as potential refuge from "AI slop, popups, fake news, propaganda and ads," with one user quipping "We'll all just be fingering each other" (referencing the finger protocol), and others suggesting Gopher and IRC as alternative minimal communication channels where "advertisers get banned."

## [Xfwl4 – The Roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor](https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_15.html)
**Score:** 265 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46779645

> **Article:** The article outlines the roadmap for xfwl4, a new Wayland compositor being developed for the Xfce desktop environment. Written by Xfce developer Alexander Schwinn, it explains the decision to build a new compositor from scratch rather than port xfwm4 (Xfce's X11 window manager). Key technical decisions include using Rust with the Smithay library for safety and maintainability, and designing the compositor to replicate xfwm4's functionality and behavior as closely as possible. The project aims to provide Xfce users with a smooth transition to Wayland while preserving the lightweight, traditional desktop experience that defines Xfce. Development is funded through community donations, and the roadmap covers phases from basic window management through to advanced features like session management and XWayland integration.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on three interwoven debates: the merits of Wayland itself, the choice of Rust for implementation, and whether Xfce's traditionally conservative userbase will accept these changes.

On Wayland's value, opinions split sharply. Critics like ok123456 argue Wayland represents "a regression" plagued by usability problems, fragmentation, and a design-by-committee process that produces incomplete protocols requiring endless workarounds—comparing it unfavorably to X400 versus SMTP. Defenders, particularly jchw, counter that Wayland's protocol-centric approach prevents the ossification that crippled X11, enables cleaner handling of modern needs like DPI scaling and HDR, and provides essential security isolation that X11 lacks. jchw acknowledges the frustration with slow protocol development but argues the results are solid and the radical design actually works well in practice.

Regarding Rust, most participants agree implementation language matters little to end users unless it affects stability or performance. jchw and coldpie both note Rust's memory safety should help avoid compositor crashes, which are particularly disruptive in Wayland's architecture. Fiveplus raises specific performance concerns: xfwm4's ability to run without compositing on low-end hardware provided exceptional responsiveness that Wayland's mandatory compositing cannot replicate. jchw concedes this tradeoff exists but suggests modern techniques like hardware plane unredirection and higher refresh rates mitigate the latency penalty, while noting that supporting truly ancient hardware eventually becomes unreasonable.

On userbase reception, coldpie—a self-identified 17-year Xfce user—rejects the characterization of Xfce devotees as reflexively conservative, arguing they simply want reliability without gratuitous change. They predict grumbling but smooth adoption, comparing X11 holdouts to SysV-init diehards as a vocal minority. jchw remains more cautious, noting that many Xfce users specifically chose it to avoid the complexity and resource demands of desktops like KDE, and may view both Wayland and Rust with suspicion despite the technical reasoning.

The technical discussion also touches on specific implementation challenges Fiveplus raises: behaviors like focus-stealing prevention require entirely different approaches in Wayland's compositor-centric model, raising questions about how strictly "the same behavior" can be achieved. PunchyHamster offers a blunt counter to the performance debate, asserting Wayland has "consistently been slower than X11" with no workaround possible.

## [Amazon to shut down Go and Fresh stores](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/food/amazon-fresh-go-closures)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 4 | **ID:** 46781707

> **Article:** Amazon is reportedly planning to shut down its Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores and Amazon Fresh grocery stores. The closures mark a significant retreat from Amazon's physical retail expansion efforts, which had been positioned as a major strategic priority. Amazon Go stores used advanced computer vision technology to allow customers to grab items and leave without checkout, while Amazon Fresh represented the company's attempt to compete in the traditional grocery space. The decision suggests challenges in making these formats profitable at scale.

## [Doing the thing is doing the thing](https://www.softwaredesign.ing/blog/doing-the-thing-is-doing-the-thing)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 84 | **ID:** 46776155

> **Article:** The article "Doing the thing is doing the thing" argues that people often confuse preparatory activities—planning, researching, organizing, optimizing workflows, buying tools, setting up environments—with actually doing the work itself. The core thesis is that only direct engagement with the actual task counts as "doing the thing." Everything else, no matter how productive it feels, is avoidance behavior dressed up as preparation. The piece particularly targets the tendency to endlessly optimize systems rather than produce output, noting that "fixing your tools is not doing the thing" and "thinking about doing the thing is not doing the thing."
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely resonated with the article's premise while adding important nuance and edge cases. A central theme was the value of "doing it badly" as a valid form of doing the thing—TheAlchemist shared how embracing imperfect first attempts breaks paralysis, while others cited Dan Harmon's advice to write "a piece of shit" first then edit ruthlessly, and Ira Glass's observation about closing the gap between taste and ability through volume of work. Several commenters with ADHD noted the article felt personally relevant, with zahlman observing that the real challenge is often choosing which thing to do among many possibilities rather than execution itself.

Corporate contexts complicated the picture. gonzalohm warned that shipping working-but-rough code in organizations can trap you in maintenance hell, leading to the cynical strategy of hiding progress until quality meets personal standards. augusteo offered a counterexample where minimal planning (2-page spec, 4 months) beat extensive architectural documentation (8 months, eventual team disbandment), though dakiol noted that some planning-heavy teams succeed too. This sparked debate about where preparation ends and "the thing" begins—munificent's distinction that "planning is doing the planning thing, but it is not doing the battle thing" was widely appreciated, while dakiol argued marathon preparation is inseparable from the race itself.

The conversation touched on whether enjoyment justifies poor performance (mojoba's tone-deaf pianist neighbor versus redmattred's defense of amateur pleasure), deliberate practice versus mere repetition, and whether AI-assisted work counts as "doing the thing." Several commenters noted structural incentives often reward talking about problems over solving them—jgeada's "problem admiration society" and robofanatic's observation that non-doers are often valued more than doers. rdsubhas pushed back that collaborative work requires legitimate non-"thing" activities: meetings, code review, timesheets, and maintenance that solopreneurs can skip.

## [Russia using Interpol's wanted list to target critics abroad, leak reveals](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gg729y1yo)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46776454

> **Article:** A BBC investigation reveals leaked documents showing Russia has been using Interpol's wanted list system to target government critics abroad. The article focuses on the case of Yevgeny Pestrikov, a Russian businessman who fled to France in June 2022 after allegedly embezzling 250 million rubles from his company. He discovered he was on an Interpol "red diffusion" notice and spent nearly two years on the wanted list before Interpol's Commission for the Control of Files (CCF) ruled his case was "predominantly political" and cancelled the request. The documents showed Russia provided "generic and formulaic" information with "inadequate explanation of the alleged crime." The investigation highlights broader patterns of authoritarian states weaponizing Interpol, with Turkey also mentioned as a frequent abuser of the system.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals significant skepticism about the narrative framing of Pestrikov as a "government critic," with commenter kgeist providing detailed counter-evidence suggesting he was a 1990s oligarch who engaged in shady privatization deals, tax evasion, and embezzlement before fleeing Russia in 2022. This sparked debate about whether he manufactured a political persecution narrative to avoid extradition for ordinary crimes.

Several commenters noted that Russia's abuse of Interpol is well-documented regardless of this case's specifics, citing the Bill Browder case as a clear precedent. The broader systemic issue of authoritarian states—particularly Turkey—weaponizing Interpol received substantial attention, with links to reports on how Americans criticizing Turkey have faced travel disruptions.

The discussion touched on related topics including an ongoing Austrian court case involving an intelligence official who allegedly provided journalist addresses to FSB agents, which prompted debate about whether Russia or compromised domestic officials bear more responsibility for such infiltration. Some commenters pushed back on reflexive anti-Russia framing, with one noting that "every case in Russia is a political case" given how the judiciary operates, while others questioned whether Interpol's own review process could itself be "political."

Technical details emerged about how individuals discover Interpol notices—either through direct inquiry, border stops, or reportedly through cryptocurrency-paid services on criminal forums. The conversation also branched into how Russia and other states manufacture criminal cases against businesspeople through systemic corruption, forcing illegal payments that create ready-made prosecution material.

## [India and EU announce landmark trade deal](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrnee01r9jo)
**Score:** 177 | **Comments:** 198 | **ID:** 46778821

> **Article:** India and the European Union have announced a landmark trade agreement after years of negotiations. The deal aims to reduce tariffs and boost trade between the two economies, though specific details remain limited in the BBC reporting. The agreement comes amid shifting global trade dynamics and concerns about US tariff policies under the Trump administration.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion quickly diverged from the trade deal itself into several contentious threads. A significant portion centered on immigration concerns, particularly sparked by a Canadian commenter worried about "lop-sided" immigration from India—prompting debate about whether immigration constitutes trade, with one user comparing people to groceries in economic terms. This exchange revealed underlying tensions about cultural preservation versus labor market needs.

The mobility framework for workers and students became a flashpoint. Some commenters, particularly those with US immigration experience, welcomed easier professional movement between India and Europe as competition to the anxiety-inducing H1B system. Others questioned whether this represented genuine opportunity or downward pressure on wages, with one user noting EU tech salaries (outside Zurich/London) have stagnated to near-Bangalore levels while living costs remain higher.

Geopolitical analysis emerged from user alephnerd, who highlighted Chinese disinformation campaigns against the deal and framed it within broader EU-India defense cooperation—including Indian vendors accessing European defense modernization funds. This perspective suggested the trade agreement carried strategic significance beyond economics, particularly regarding China containment.

Salary comparisons between US and EU tech markets generated disagreement, with claims of 3-4x US premiums countered by arguments about healthcare, education, and childcare costs. The discussion touched on whether US immigration restrictions under Trump might trigger a "European flowering" of talent, though skeptics noted structural salary differences would persist regardless of administration changes.

A meta-thread developed around BBC's US-only paywall, with international users confirming free access elsewhere. This prompted clarification about BBC's status as public broadcaster rather than state media, and debate about whether taxing non-UK users represented reasonable cost recovery.

The thread exhibited notable pattern: established users with geopolitical expertise attempted substantive analysis while newer accounts repeatedly raised immigration concerns, leading to accusations of coordinated wedge-issue promotion. By the discussion's end, the original trade deal details had been largely overshadowed by immigration culture-war dynamics and transatlantic salary comparisons.

## [Thief of $90M in seized U.S.-controlled crypto is gov't contractor's son](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/single/lick-theft)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46787521

> **Article:** A government contractor's son allegedly stole $90 million in cryptocurrency that was under U.S. government control. The contractor's firm had been hired by the U.S. Marshals Service to manage seized crypto assets from criminal investigations. The theft occurred in October 2024, but the government reportedly failed to detect it until the thief, Zachary "Zach" Lick, began publicly boasting about the crime and taunting investigators by sending small amounts of cryptocurrency from the fraudulent wallets to them. The case highlights severe security failures in how the government handles digital asset custody.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on several interconnected themes: the breathtaking incompetence revealed by the theft, the brazenness of the perpetrator, and broader cynicism about government contracting and political accountability.

Commenters expressed astonishment at how the crime was discovered—not through government detection but because the thief couldn't resist showing off. As one user noted, this was the "perfect crime undone by ego." The thief's ongoing mockery of investigators, including sending them traceable cryptocurrency transactions, struck many as almost surreal in its audacity.

The father's position as a government contractor sparked heated discussion about cronyism and incompetence in federal contracting. Several users observed that this case exemplifies how "connected" individuals secure lucrative government work regardless of merit. The security failures were particularly galling given that this involved literal embezzlement rather than sophisticated hacking—one commenter dryly noted the assets "wasn't managed in even a slightly competent manner."

Political dimensions emerged quickly. Some commenters referenced recent pardon controversies, with cynical speculation that a large enough donation might secure clemency. Others pushed back against politicizing the incident, noting the theft occurred under the Biden administration and that government contractor incompetence transcends partisan boundaries. The Trevor Milton pardon was cited as evidence that wealthy defendants can effectively purchase immunity, with one user suggesting a "$2m price on pardons" creates predictable incentives.

A darker undercurrent examined what this reveals about institutional decay. Users compared this to other cases of familial corruption in government and discussed how the absence of consequences enables such behavior. One particularly pointed observation framed the theft as a "DDOS reflection attack but with government"—manipulating state power against enemies at no personal risk.

The discussion also touched on what happens to seized cryptocurrency, with users questioning whether liquidation procedures even exist or function properly. Several commenters praised Molly White (author of the linked Web3 Is Going Great blog) for her thorough documentation of crypto-related failures.

Throughout, a tension persisted between those seeing this as emblematic of systemic rot in government contracting and those treating it as an almost comically absurd individual failure—though even the latter camp acknowledged the staggering sums involved make laughter difficult.

## [Amazon closing its Fresh and Go stores](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-closing-fresh-grocery-convenience-150437789.html)
**Score:** 150 | **Comments:** 373 | **ID:** 46781444

> **Article:** Amazon is closing its Amazon Fresh grocery stores and Amazon Go convenience stores as part of a strategic retreat from its physical retail grocery ambitions. The company acquired Whole Foods in 2017 and later expanded with Amazon Fresh (full-size grocery stores) and Amazon Go (cashierless convenience stores using "Just Walk Out" technology). The closures represent a significant pullback from Amazon's attempt to disrupt the traditional grocery industry through technology and aggressive pricing.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism about Amazon's grocery strategy, with commenters identifying multiple interconnected failures. A recurring theme is that Amazon fundamentally misunderstood retail operations: stores were poorly managed with no visible leadership, employees focused on online fulfillment rather than customer service, and shelves stocked with expired products. One frequent shopper described the experience as "mediocre" and "poorly run," tolerated only because of artificially low prices.

The pricing strategy itself drew scrutiny as a classic predatory tactic—deliberately operating at losses to undercut competition, with examples like $0.25 avocados and Barilla pasta at $0.85. Commenters noted this pattern mirrors broader FAANG behavior and Amazon's historical playbook of bleeding out competitors before raising prices.

The "Just Walk Out" technology emerged as a particular symbol of Amazon's overpromising. What was marketed as AI-powered computer vision was revealed to rely on approximately 1,000 Indian workers manually reviewing transactions—labor that became relatively more expensive post-COVID. This deception damaged trust, with users describing the experience as feeling surveilled and treated like presumed thieves rather than welcomed customers.

Several commenters contrasted Amazon's approach with successful regional grocers like Wegmans, though even Wegmans has reportedly declined. Others noted the urban-suburban divide: dense walkable neighborhoods with specialized local shops don't need massive supermarkets, while car-dependent areas do. The closures have left some communities as "grocery deserts," with one Seattle resident describing how Amazon demolished a local grocer, delayed opening through COVID, and now may abandon the location entirely.

The discussion also touched on Amazon's broader pattern of extracting concessions from municipalities (comparing HQ2) and leaving empty storefronts when ventures fail, suggesting a corporate culture that treats physical retail as a technology problem rather than a service business requiring human expertise and community relationships.
