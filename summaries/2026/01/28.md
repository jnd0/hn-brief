# Hacker News Summary - 2026-01-28

## [Microsoft forced me to switch to Linux](https://www.himthe.dev/blog/microsoft-to-linux)
**Score:** 1515 | **Comments:** 1207 | **ID:** 46795864

> **Article:** The article "Microsoft forced me to switch to Linux" is a personal account of the author's migration away from Windows. The catalyst was the release of Windows 11, which deemed the author's perfectly functional CPU incompatible due to the lack of TPM 2.0. The author frames this not as a choice, but as a forced hand by Microsoft's restrictive hardware requirements. The article details the initial hurdles of installing a Linux distribution (specifically Fedora), the learning curve of the command line, and the eventual satisfaction with the new environment. The author concludes that while the switch wasn't seamless, the freedom, control, and lack of artificial limitations offered by Linux were a significant upgrade over the "walled garden" and hardware obsolescence dictated by Microsoft.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the article's premise, with many users sharing their own recent or long-standing reasons for switching to Linux from Windows. The conversation can be broken down into a few key themes:

The primary driver for switching appears to be Microsoft's own policies. A significant number of commenters, like `sedatk` and `ufmace`, cite the strict hardware requirements for Windows 11 (specifically CPU incompatibility) as the final straw that pushed them to try Linux. Others, like `giancarlostoro`, were frustrated by other Windows 10/11 limitations, such as the need for a Pro license to create an offline account or the proliferation of ads. A common sentiment was that Microsoft's own missteps, rather than Linux's perfection, were the cause of the migration.

Gaming on Linux was a major sub-topic. The consensus is that the situation has improved dramatically, thanks largely to Steam and Proton. A commenter argues that more games run on Linux than on any console, making the platform viable for most players. However, a significant caveat was raised regarding multiplayer games, which often use invasive anti-cheat software ("rootkits") that is incompatible with Linux. This remains a key barrier for competitive gamers.

A counterpoint was raised by `ryandrake`, who noted that Apple also practices aggressive hardware obsolescence, cutting off old Macs from new OS versions, yet seems to receive less criticism for it.

On the other side, experienced Linux users acknowledged that the platform still has friction points. `marginalia_nu` pointed out persistent issues like fragmented UI frameworks (GTK vs. Qt, X vs. Wayland), poor support for non-standard DPI monitors, and difficulties with audio/webcam configuration. However, another commenter countered that Windows suffers from its own "UI balkanization" with multiple inconsistent design paradigms.

Finally, there was a debate about performance. While one commenter described a high-end Windows 11 laptop as laggy and slow, another argued this was likely due to corporate bloatware and that a clean Windows 11 install can be fast. Anecdotes were shared about third-party developers creating much faster alternatives to core Windows components like the file explorer, suggesting a decline in Microsoft's software performance.

## [Amazon cuts 16k jobs](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/amazon-cuts-16000-jobs-globally-broader-restructuring-2026-01-28/)
**Score:** 454 | **Comments:** 639 | **ID:** 46796745

> **Article:** The Reuters article reports that Amazon is cutting 16,000 jobs globally as part of a broader restructuring effort. The cuts primarily affect employees in corporate roles, including within the Alexa and devices divisions, and are framed by the company as a move to streamline operations and focus on higher-margin areas.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three primary themes: the underlying reasons for the layoffs, the role of AI in the workforce, and the broader economic and political context of global hiring.

A significant portion of the debate centers on whether the layoffs are a genuine strategic shift or simply a correction of "ZIRP-era overhiring." Many commenters are skeptical of Amazon's official narrative, suggesting that "AI" has become a convenient buzzword to justify standard restructuring and cost-cutting measures, similar to how "economic headwinds" were used in the past. Others counter that AI's increasing productivity is a legitimate driver for reducing headcount, particularly in roles like middle management.

The conversation also explores the human impact of automation through a poignant anecdote about a manager who built a tool to replace his own function, highlighting the often-unseen consequences of efficiency-driven progress. This led to a philosophical debate on economic progress, with some arguing that job displacement is an inevitable part of technological advancement (like horse-shoe makers) and that society should focus on retraining and support systems like UBI, while others express sympathy for those whose careers are being "optimized" away.

Finally, the discussion touches on the intersection of global labor markets and corporate strategy. Commenters debate whether these cuts are part of a direct relocation strategy to countries like India or a more generalized global optimization. This spirals into a heated argument about the H1B visa program, with participants disagreeing on whether it suppresses domestic wages or is necessary to fill a shortage of qualified tech talent in the U.S.

## [ICE and Palantir: US agents using health data to hunt illegal immigrants](https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s168)
**Score:** 423 | **Comments:** 250 | **ID:** 46794365

> **Article:** The article from the BMJ reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been accessing vast amounts of healthcare data through a contract with Palantir. The data, originally collected by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Medicare and Medicaid services, is being used to identify and track undocumented immigrants for deportation. This includes sensitive information such as names, addresses, birthdates, and social security numbers. The article highlights concerns from privacy advocates about the lack of legal basis for sharing this protected health information for immigration enforcement and the potential chilling effect it has on immigrant communities seeking medical care.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focuses on the broader implications of public-private surveillance partnerships and the erosion of privacy and legal accountability.

**The Rise of Privatized Surveillance**
A central theme is the danger posed by private companies in surveillance, which users argue is more insidious than direct government surveillance. Commenters note that companies have a financial incentive to innovate new ways to collect data to sell to governments or other actors. There is a sense of vindication among long-time privacy advocates who feel their warnings from the early 2000s were dismissed as paranoia but have now materialized. A common sentiment is that the public has traded privacy for convenience (e.g., social media, streaming services), creating a "devil's bargain" that leads to a comfortable but authoritarian society.

**Palantir’s Role and Government Efficiency**
Users discuss Palantir's effectiveness not as a product company but as a service that integrates disparate data silos for governments. Commenters suggest Palantir bypasses bureaucratic inefficiencies by creating centralized data lakes, allowing agencies to correlate information that was previously separated (e.g., health records with immigration status). This capability is viewed as a double-edged sword: while it solves IT inefficiencies, it also enables mass surveillance that might otherwise be hindered by red tape.

**Rule of Law and Political Hypocrisy**
The conversation turns to the legal and political ramifications. Many commenters argue that the sharing of this data constitutes a clear violation of privacy laws, but they express cynicism that any accountability will follow, citing a belief that the rule of law is no longer enforced on the federal government. The discussion also touches on political hypocrisy, specifically regarding "small government" conservatives supporting such expansive surveillance and enforcement measures. However, some users note that surveillance overreach is a bipartisan issue, referencing the Obama administration's deportation numbers and the passage of the Patriot Act under Bush.

**Immigration Policy and Data Utility**
There is a debate regarding the utility of health data for tracking immigrants. Some users question the logic, noting that undocumented immigrants are generally ineligible for Medicare/Medicaid, raising questions about how useful this specific dataset is. However, others clarify that the data likely serves to track individuals who may have interacted with the healthcare system in other ways (e.g., emergency rooms, local clinics) or to cross-reference identities. The discussion also touches on the shift in ICE enforcement priorities, with data cited suggesting a move away from targeting criminals toward broad sweeps of non-criminal immigrants.

## [Airfoil (2024)](https://ciechanow.ski/airfoil/)
**Score:** 329 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46795908

> **Article:** The article "Airfoil" by Bartosz Ciechanowski is an interactive, visual explainer on the aerodynamics of airfoils. Using detailed diagrams and simulations, it breaks down complex concepts like lift, drag, pressure distribution, and the Bernoulli principle. The piece clarifies how airfoils are engineered to optimize the ratio of lift to drag, manage airflow (laminar vs. turbulent), and function across various speeds, rather than serving as a singular "magic" shape that enables flight.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on three main themes: a technical debate on the mechanics of lift, the appreciation for high-quality educational content, and the implications of AI on content creation.

**Aerodynamic Nuances**
A significant thread debates the necessity of airfoil shapes. Several commenters argue that a flat plate can generate lift and that airfoils are primarily an optimization for efficiency (lift-to-drag ratio) rather than a prerequisite for flight. This sparked a deeper discussion on the role of angle of attack versus wing geometry (camber) and the physics of equilibrium.

**Praise for the Author**
There is overwhelming admiration for Bartosz Ciechanowski’s work. Users describe the article as "brilliant" and "the missing course for Aerospace Engineering," praising the clarity, visual creativity, and depth of the interactive explanations. Many expressed hope for more content from the author, noting a lack of new posts in 2025.

**AI and Content Creation**
A sub-thread探讨 the future of AI in generating educational explainers. Opinions are divided:
*   **Skeptics** argue that AI currently only imitates such content superficially and lacks the "subtle teaching nuances" and genuine creativity of human experts.
*   **Proponents** believe AI tools (like Claude) are already capable of producing similar visualizations but require significant human oversight to ensure accuracy, warning of the risk of "functionally correct but factually wrong" details.

## [ASML staffing changes could result in a net reduction of around 1700 positions](https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2026/strengthening-focus-on-engineering-and-innovation)
**Score:** 325 | **Comments:** 332 | **ID:** 46792370

> **Article:** ASML, the Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer, announced a major restructuring plan that could result in a net reduction of around 1,700 positions. The plan aims to "strengthen focus on engineering and innovation" by reducing management layers. Specifically, the company plans to eliminate 3,000 out of its 4,500 engineering manager positions, but will transition 1,400 of them into individual engineering roles. The stated goal is to reduce bureaucracy and free up engineers' time, which is currently spent on 35% coordination with management. The announcement also coincided with a new €12 billion share buyback program.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly positive about the layoffs, viewing them as a necessary and "ballsy" move to combat the bureaucratic bloat and "managerialism" that plagues many large European corporations.

The key themes are:
*   **Bureaucracy as a Disease:** Multiple users, including former employees of similar companies like Philips and Siemens, shared anecdotes of how engineering-focused cultures become "top-heavy," inefficient, and stagnant after being flooded with managers. They praised ASML for recognizing and acting against this risk, which they see as a common path to corporate decline.
*   **Share Buybacks:** The €12 billion buyback program was met with skepticism by one user who feared it was a sign of "financialization" and hollowing out the company. However, this view was quickly challenged by others who argued that buybacks are a standard and efficient way for profitable companies to return capital to shareholders, citing tech giants like Apple and Microsoft as examples.
*   **Engineering vs. Management Culture:** Commenters debated the relationship between engineers and managers. While some argued they are "equals," others pointed out the practical reality that management is a promotion track with more power and higher pay. The move to reduce managers was seen as a strong signal that ASML is re-asserting the value of its engineering culture.
*   **Counter-Narrative to AI:** In a side discussion, some users noted the irony of a high-tech company doubling down on core engineering roles at a time when the prevailing narrative suggests AI will eliminate such jobs.

## [Show HN: The HN Arcade](https://andrewgy8.github.io/hnarcade/)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 76 | **ID:** 46793693

> **Project:** The project is "The HN Arcade," a curated directory of games that have been shared on Hacker News. The site presents a simple, retro-styled grid of game cards, each linking to the original game. The creator's goal is to make it easier to discover the many games that are posted to HN but often get lost over time. The project is open-source, and the creator encourages others to submit new games via pull requests to its GitHub repository.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the HN Arcade was overwhelmingly positive, with many users appreciating the concept of having a central place to discover games shared on the platform. Several commenters immediately submitted their own games for inclusion, demonstrating a clear demand for such a directory.

The discussion quickly evolved into a debate on how to best curate and maintain the list for long-term health. A prominent suggestion was to move the project from a personal account to a community-owned GitHub organization to ensure it doesn't become abandoned if the original creator loses interest. This led to a broader conversation about the lifecycle of "Awesome Lists" on GitHub, with some users cautioning that many such lists are created for personal promotion and are eventually neglected after achieving their goal.

Beyond the meta-discussion, users provided substantial feedback on the site's features and usability:
*   **Curation & Sorting:** There was a strong call for better ways to navigate the growing list of games. Suggestions included sorting by popularity (e.g., HN upvotes), adding thumbnails or GIFs for visual preview, and implementing a random shuffle feature to promote the discovery of lesser-known games.
*   **UI/UX Feedback:** One user reported that the high-contrast UI on the words.zip game was visually straining, leading to a discussion about accessibility options. Another user noted that a game listed (Holedown) was now a paid title on other platforms, suggesting a "paid" tag could be useful (though the creator confirmed this tag already exists).
*   **Technical Integrity:** A skeptical user questioned whether the project's data was generated by an LLM after finding a broken link for a "Lichess" entry. Other users investigated and found the project's scraper code, concluding it was a legitimate effort rather than AI-generated.

Overall, the community engaged deeply with the project, offering both praise and constructive criticism aimed at improving its utility and ensuring its longevity.

## [Super Monkey Ball ported to a website](https://monkeyball-online.pages.dev/)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 80 | **ID:** 46789961

> **Article:** The article links to a website that hosts a fan-made, browser-based port of the classic GameCube game, *Super Monkey Ball*. The port is implemented in TypeScript and runs directly in the web browser without requiring an emulator. The project is open-source and available on GitHub.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the technical execution of the port and the methods used to create it. While many commenters were impressed by the quality and playability of the browser-based game, a significant portion of the conversation focused on speculation that the code was generated by an AI like Claude, based on the project's structure and the author's admission of being a "newbie" at web development. This led to a debate about the ethics of using AI trained on community decompilation efforts without disclosure, especially as the author was soliciting donations for the project.

Other key themes included:
*   **Nostalgia and Feature Comparison:** Users compared the web version to the original GameCube title, noting the absence of the monkey inside the ball and the iconic "Aaah!" scream when falling. Some found the keyboard controls more sensitive than the original's analog joystick.
*   **Broader Platform Debates:** The port sparked a tangent about the historical and ongoing limitations of web gaming compared to native mobile apps, referencing the iPhone's early "web apps only" stance and the subsequent rise of the App Store.
*   **Community and Collaboration:** The project's author was present in the comments, engaging with feedback and merging pull requests, which added a collaborative feel to the discussion despite the AI-related controversy.

## [Rust at Scale: An Added Layer of Security for WhatsApp](https://engineering.fb.com/2026/01/27/security/rust-at-scale-security-whatsapp/)
**Score:** 233 | **Comments:** 120 | **ID:** 46791742

> **Article:** The article from Meta Engineering details the large-scale integration of Rust into WhatsApp's Android client to enhance security. The team replaced a 160,000-line C++ message processing library with a new Rust implementation of 90,000 lines. To ensure reliability during this massive rewrite, they employed a parallel rollout strategy where both the original C++ and the new Rust code ran simultaneously, using differential fuzzing to verify that the outputs were identical. While the rewrite introduced a binary size increase of approximately 200 KiB due to the Rust standard library, the team mitigated this through build system optimizations, including a transition to Buck2, which improved Link Time Optimization (LTO) and reduced build times. The project is described as the largest global rollout of a Rust library to date.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion diverged significantly from the technical details of the Rust implementation, focusing instead on WhatsApp's market dominance, privacy concerns, and the practicalities of software deployment.

A major theme was WhatsApp's ubiquity and the resulting network effect. Commenters highlighted its status as the primary communication tool for 3 billion users, particularly outside the US. This led to debates about the difficulty of challenging its market position, with some expressing a personal refusal to use the platform due to its association with Meta and its "enshittification" through business spam and ads. An anecdote from a developer detailed severe difficulties in interacting with WhatsApp's business APIs and support systems, illustrating the challenges of building on the platform.

Privacy and encryption were heavily scrutinized. While the article touted WhatsApp's default end-to-end encryption (E2EE), commenters were skeptical of Meta's trustworthiness. The debate centered on the distinction between the mathematical security of the protocol and the potential for the client-side application or the company to exfiltrate data. Some argued that closed-source software inherently requires trusting the vendor not to be malicious, while others countered that open-source code allows for independent verification. The discussion also touched on the legal pressures companies face from government surveillance requests, suggesting that E2EE claims can be circumvented by legal coercion.

Technical discussions that did occur focused on the practical implications of the rewrite. Commenters were curious about the binary size increase, discussing whether the team accepted the overhead or employed specific strategies like no-std or custom builds to minimize it. The differential fuzzing and parallel rollout strategy was widely praised as a pragmatic and safe approach to migrating critical production code. There was also a minor side-discussion about the inefficiency of using full Android tablets for simple embedded devices, like gym equipment, highlighting issues of hardware lifespan and over-engineering.

## [Make.ts](https://matklad.github.io/2026/01/27/make-ts.html)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 114 | **ID:** 46792194

> **Article:** The article "Make.ts" argues for using a TypeScript file as a "makefile" for personal or project automation tasks. The author, Alex Kladov, expresses frustration with traditional shell scripting, citing its poor error handling, lack of data structures, and awkward syntax as reasons why simple scripts quickly become fragile and hard to maintain. He advocates for capturing ad-hoc shell commands into a persistent script file, but using a proper programming language like TypeScript instead of shell. This approach makes commands reusable, shareable, and more robust. The article provides a concrete example of a `make.ts` file that uses a tagged template literal to execute shell commands, combining the power of TypeScript's type system and tooling with the convenience of shell execution. The core idea is to treat automation scripts with the same care as application code, versioning them and making them a central part of the development workflow.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's premise that shell scripting is often inadequate for complex tasks, but explores a wide range of alternatives and nuances.

A central theme is the search for a better scripting language. While the article focuses on TypeScript, many commenters champion other options. Python is frequently mentioned, with the `uv` tool being highlighted as a modern solution that resolves its traditional weaknesses in dependency management for scripts. Deno (for TypeScript/JavaScript) is also praised for its excellent developer experience in this area. Several dedicated task runners were proposed as mature solutions to this problem, including `just` for its Make-like but more user-friendly syntax, and `mise` for its all-in-one capabilities (task running, tool versioning, and dependency caching).

Debates emerged around the specifics of implementation. Some argued that established practices like `npm scripts` in `package.json` or `Makefiles` already solve this problem effectively, though others noted their limitations, such as JSON's verbosity for complex commands or Make's cross-platform issues. The concept of "ephemeral vs. permanent" scripts was also discussed, with one user arguing that scripts should be version-controlled and shared, while another countered that many personal scripts are tied to a specific local machine setup and shouldn't be.

Finally, the discussion touched on the nature of technical writing itself, with multiple users expressing appreciation for the article's direct, hand-written style, contrasting it with the perceived homogeneity of LLM-generated content. The article also inspired a practical tip for converting API testing workflows from GUI tools like Postman into simple, version-controllable shell scripts using `curl`.

## [Somebody used spoofed ADSB signals to raster the meme of JD Vance](https://alecmuffett.com/article/143548)
**Score:** 194 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46802067

> **Article:** An article on Alec Muffett's blog reports an incident where someone created a flight path in the shape of a meme of JD Vance using ADS-B data. The path was visible on flight tracking websites like ADS-B Exchange, appearing as a plane with the callsign "VANCE 1" flying a specific pattern. The article highlights the method used to generate this visual data.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the technical method used to create the flight path image and the legal implications of doing so. There is a strong consensus that the creator did not actually broadcast spoofed radio frequency (RF) signals, which would be a serious federal crime involving the FCC and FAA. Instead, the community determined that the prank was likely executed by feeding fake data directly to the ADS-B Exchange API using a software-defined radio (SDR) simulator or by exploiting the open data ingestion system. This method is considered less severe than RF spoofing, which could interfere with air traffic control.

Key points of discussion include:
*   **Technical Explanation:** Users explained that ADS-B data is unencrypted and unauthenticated. Flight tracking websites rely on a network of volunteer feeders who submit data. The prankster exploited this by submitting fabricated location data for a non-existent aircraft, which the website then visualized as a flight path. Several users noted that other tracking sites did not display the "plane," confirming it was a targeted data injection rather than a widespread RF signal.
*   **Legal Ramifications:** This was a major topic. While some initially speculated it could be a federal crime, the discussion clarified that spoofing data sent to a website is different from broadcasting on licensed radio spectrum. The latter would be a clear violation of FCC regulations and potentially endanger aviation safety. For the API-based spoofing, users suggested less severe legal avenues like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or wire fraud, but many felt it was a harmless prank. One user noted that the FAA's authority to enforce ADS-B requirements is a currently open legal question post-*Chevron*.
*   **Context and Tone:** The conversation included links to the meme itself and related political content, reflecting the article's context. The overall tone was one of amusement and technical curiosity rather than condemnation, with users appreciating the cleverness of the hack while clarifying the technical and legal distinctions.

## [AISLE’s autonomous analyzer found all CVEs in the January OpenSSL release](https://aisle.com/blog/aisle-discovered-12-out-of-12-openssl-vulnerabilities)
**Score:** 191 | **Comments:** 128 | **ID:** 46789913

> **Article:** The article from AISLE claims their autonomous analyzer successfully identified all 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities in the January OpenSSL release. This includes issues dating back to 1998, demonstrating the tool's capability to find critical security flaws in mature, heavily audited codebases that manual reviews have missed. The findings highlight the limits of traditional code review, even for foundational internet infrastructure.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by a consensus that the OpenSSL codebase is exceptionally poor quality, described by users as a "hostile codebase" and "beyond horrible to read." Multiple commenters, citing sources like a presentation by Giovani Bechis and the pyca cryptography team, argue that the code is a chaotic collection of research-grade implementations and legacy cruft that actively hides bugs. The conversation frequently contrasts OpenSSL with forks like LibreSSL and BoringSSL, which are viewed as more maintainable and readable alternatives.

While the discovery of 12 vulnerabilities is acknowledged as impressive, the discussion splits into two main themes regarding AI's role. One camp is bullish on AI for this specific use case—finding bugs in complex, legacy code—while remaining bearish on AI's ability to generate working software from scratch. The other major theme is the dual-edged nature of AI-powered vulnerability discovery: while it helps defenders patch flaws, it also lowers the barrier for attackers to find and exploit them at an unprecedented scale.

Several technical details were debated, including the severity of specific bugs found (like an unencrypted partial block in the OCB API) and the effectiveness of modern mitigations like Fil-C. A significant undercurrent was the poor state of OpenSSL's development practices, with comments noting that the project's CI is flaky and that failing tests are often merged, allowing bugs to slip through even when automated checks catch them. Ultimately, many argued that the root problem is complexity and that simplicity, maintainability, and human readability are more critical for security than the tools used to find bugs.

## [Oban, the job processing framework from Elixir, has come to Python](https://www.dimamik.com/posts/oban_py/)
**Score:** 162 | **Comments:** 72 | **ID:** 46797594

> **Article:** The article announces the release of Oban Py, a port of the popular Elixir job processing framework Oban to Python. Oban is a robust, database-backed job queue system that leverages PostgreSQL for durability. The key value proposition highlighted is its use of the database for job queuing, which allows jobs to be inserted and processed within the same database transaction as the application's data changes. This provides strong consistency guarantees, eliminating the need for complex patterns like the transactional outbox to ensure that jobs are only queued if the primary data transaction succeeds.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the trade-offs between database-backed and external queue systems (like Redis), the viability of Oban in the competitive Python ecosystem, and its business model.

A central theme is the debate over using a traditional database versus a dedicated system like Redis for job queuing. One side argues that Redis adds complexity and that using the existing database simplifies architecture. The counter-argument is that traditional databases are a poor fit for high-throughput job systems, as the transactional overhead of fetching and updating jobs can be significant. However, proponents of Oban (including one of its creators) contend that Oban's specific implementation using PostgreSQL is highly optimized, capable of handling immense throughput (millions of jobs per minute) and that the transactional integration is a major feature.

There is also significant discussion about Oban's place in the Python ecosystem. While some see it as a lightweight and welcome alternative to heavyweights like Temporal or complex tools like Celery, others question its competitiveness. The primary criticism is the pricing model, which locks essential features like multi-process execution and workflows behind a "Pro" subscription. Commenters note that the Python ecosystem has many mature, free alternatives, and locking such core functionality could hinder adoption. The creators defended this by stating that a support-only model isn't viable for them and that they may move some features to the open-source version based on feedback. The conversation also touched on the history between Oban and Sidekiq, with the Sidekiq creator clarifying that the "based on" relationship was more about sharing open-source business models than technical architecture.

## [Apple to Soon Take Up to 30% Cut from All Patreon Creators in iOS App](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/patreon-apple-tax/)
**Score:** 160 | **Comments:** 121 | **ID:** 46801419

> **Article:** The article from MacRumors reports that Apple will soon enforce its standard 30% commission on all Patreon creators who use the platform's iOS app for transactions. This move is part of Apple's broader application of its App Store policies to digital goods and services, extending its "Apple Tax" to a platform that previously allowed creators to bypass it. The change is expected to significantly impact creators' earnings, as they would either have to absorb the cost or raise prices for their iOS-based subscribers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Apple's decision, viewing it as an example of corporate greed and overreach. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

A significant portion of the debate centers on the historical context and justification for the 30% fee. Several commenters argue that while the fee may have been reasonable in the early days of the App Store to cover distribution costs, it is now an archaic and excessive "tax" that no longer reflects the low cost of digital distribution. One user provided historical context, suggesting the 30% figure originated from a 15% distributor/15% retailer split from the era of physical software, a cost structure that is irrelevant today. This point was further linked to the idea that Apple's initial push for very low app prices ($0.99) devalued software, forcing the industry towards the subscription and ad-driven models that now make this 30% cut so impactful.

There is a strong anti-Apple sentiment, with users criticizing CEO Tim Cook's leadership for prioritizing services revenue at the expense of product quality, software stability, and developer relations. While one commenter conceded that Cook's era has produced incredible hardware, another immediately countered that this was only true before the influence of Jony Ive led to problematic design choices like the butterfly keyboard.

The discussion also explored potential solutions and the broader market dynamic. Some users suggested workarounds, such as using an in-app browser for purchases, but were quickly reminded that this is a grey area and was only made permissible in the US following the Epic v. Apple lawsuit. A recurring theme is the frustration with the "duopoly" of Apple and Google, where developers and users are forced to choose between two "shitty trade-offs." This led to a meta-debate about the role of regulation, with some advocating for government intervention to curb Apple's power, while others expressed skepticism about granting governments more control over technology. Ultimately, many commenters felt that Apple's aggressive monetization is precisely what is prompting regulatory bodies like the EU and US DOJ to take action against them.

## [Android's desktop interface leaks](https://9to5google.com/2026/01/27/android-desktop-leak/)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 217 | **ID:** 46790740

> **Article:** The article reports on a leak of Android's upcoming desktop interface, suggesting Google is developing a feature that allows users to connect their Android phones to an external display to use a desktop-like environment. This functionality would enable users to run apps in resizable windows, access a taskbar, and potentially use browser extensions, aiming to transform smartphones into makeshift desktop computers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is divided on the practicality and implications of Android's potential desktop mode.

A primary theme is the economic viability and utility for users on a budget. Some commenters argue this feature could be a game-changer for students and families, allowing them to avoid buying a separate laptop by simply plugging their existing phone into a screen. However, this is immediately countered by others who point out significant practical hurdles. Skeptics note that phones with reliable display output are often flagship models, which are expensive. They argue that the used market offers far more powerful and cost-effective options, such as a $50 used corporate laptop running Linux, which provides a superior desktop experience with more RAM, storage, and a full-fledged OS. The debate extends to global contexts, with users discussing the relative costs and availability of both used laptops and phones with display-out capabilities in different economic regions.

Another major point of discussion revolves around the "locked-down" nature of Android. Many users express concern that this move pushes the ecosystem further toward a walled-garden model, similar to iOS, where users have limited control over their software and hardware. This is contrasted with the open nature of traditional desktop operating systems. The conversation touches on Valve's investment in Linux as a strategic response to such trends in the Windows ecosystem. While some users lament the loss of control, others acknowledge the security benefits for non-technical users, though they still wish for the ability to install alternative operating systems on their hardware.

Finally, commenters discuss the historical context and future potential of this concept. The Motorola Atrix from 2011 is frequently cited as a past failure in this space, raising questions about why this idea is being revived now. There is also skepticism about Google's ability to execute on this vision long-term, with references to the abandoned Fuchsia OS project as an example of the company's scattered focus. Some technically-minded users point out that Android already has many of the underlying components for a desktop experience, such as a terminal and Wayland support, suggesting the leak is about a user-facing layer on top of existing capabilities. The broader discussion also touches on the desire for a seamless, multi-device experience that current mobile and desktop platforms fail to deliver.

## [I stopped following the news](https://mertbulan.com/2026/01/28/why-i-stopped-following-the-news/)
**Score:** 123 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46792580

> **Article:** The article "I stopped following the news" argues that the modern news cycle is a source of anxiety, distraction, and unhappiness. The author describes the "news addiction" cycle—constantly refreshing feeds and feeling overwhelmed by negative events. He argues that this constant consumption does not translate into meaningful action or change, but rather leads to burnout and apathy. The author advocates for a "low-information diet," suggesting that one can stay generally aware of major developments through periodic, curated sources (like a weekly magazine) rather than daily breaking news. This approach, he claims, frees up mental energy for personal life, family, and local community engagement, which he argues are more tangible and fulfilling ways to spend one's time.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the tension between personal well-being and civic duty, with a significant portion of the thread debating the ethics of "tuning out."

A primary theme was the validation of the article's premise. Many users shared personal anecdotes about the negative mental health effects of news consumption, citing increased anxiety, reduced productivity, and strained family interactions. These users supported the idea of a "low-information diet" to preserve sanity and focus on what they can control.

However, a strong counter-argument emerged, focusing on privilege and civic responsibility. Several commenters argued that the ability to ignore the news is a luxury afforded to those whose lives are not directly threatened by political events. This perspective held that disengagement is a form of apathy that allows authoritarianism and injustice to flourish. This debate became particularly pointed regarding US politics, with some non-US users expressing frustration that American news dominates global forums, while others insisted that US political developments have worldwide consequences that cannot be ignored.

Finally, there was a discussion about the *quality* of news consumption versus the *quantity*. Many users distinguished between "being informed" and "consuming news." They argued that the fast-paced, sensationalist nature of modern news (especially TV and click-driven websites) creates a shallow, reactive understanding of complex issues. A popular alternative suggested was consuming long-form, periodic journalism (e.g., weekly magazines) to gain deeper context without the daily stress of the "breaking news" cycle. A few users also suggested practical solutions, such as filtering news for business/economic impact or building tools to force slower, more intentional reading.

## [Show HN: I built a small browser engine from scratch in C++](https://github.com/beginner-jhj/mini_browser)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46795540

> **Project:** The project is a minimal browser engine built from scratch in C++, named "mini_browser". It is a learning-oriented "toy" implementation that parses HTML, handles basic layout and rendering, and uses an external library (Qt) for networking and window management. The author appears to be a student (likely high school or early college) who used AI assistance for some parts of the development.
>
> **Discussion:** The response to the project was overwhelmingly positive, with users praising the technical difficulty of building a browser engine from scratch and the author's dedication, especially given their apparent age. Many commenters offered encouragement and suggestions for future extensions, such as building a custom HTTP server or contributing to existing small browser projects like Dillo.

However, there were two distinct points of contention. First, a user questioned whether the project was "homework," which was quickly refuted by others who argued that the complexity far exceeds typical school assignments. Second, and more significantly, a debate emerged regarding the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). Several users speculated that the code or commit messages suggested heavy AI assistance, while others defended the author, noting that the commit patterns and code structure were consistent with a beginner learning Git and coding manually. The author themselves later confirmed using LLMs, which shifted the discussion toward how AI tools are used in the learning process.

## [Jellyfin LLM/"AI" Development Policy](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/contributing/llm-policies/)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46801976

> **Article:** The linked article is Jellyfin's official development policy regarding the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI in their open-source project. The policy strictly prohibits AI-generated content in direct communication, such as issue discussions, pull request descriptions, and comments. However, it allows for LLM-assisted translations for non-native English speakers who are struggling to convey their intent accurately. For code contributions, the policy maintains existing standards: code must be high-quality, well-tested, and fully understood by the contributor. The core principle is that contributors must take full responsibility for their submissions and demonstrate genuine comprehension, rather than relying on AI to generate content they do not understand.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a strong consensus in favor of Jellyfin's policy, with the community largely agreeing that the primary problem is the low quality and overwhelming volume of AI-generated "slop." A key distinction emerged between using AI for code versus communication. While many argued that code quality should be judged on its own merits regardless of its origin, a stronger sentiment held that LLM-generated human interaction is particularly harmful. Commenters felt that AI-generated comments and descriptions are inefficient, untrustworthy, and waste maintainers' time, as the submitter often lacks a deep understanding of the changes they are proposing.

The allowance for LLM-assisted translation was a point of nuanced debate. Some viewed it as a valuable accessibility tool that fosters global collaboration. However, others argued that human-written, non-native English is preferable to a potentially misleading or "fluffified" machine translation, emphasizing the importance of authentic communication. Ultimately, the discussion framed the policy not as a rejection of AI, but as a necessary measure to combat the deluge of low-effort contributions and ensure that all submissions, whether code or text, are backed by genuine human understanding and responsibility.

## [Virtual Boy on TV with Intelligent Systems Video Boy](https://hcs64.com/video-boy-vue/)
**Score:** 90 | **Comments:** 32 | **ID:** 46792572

> **Article:** The linked article, "Virtual Boy on TV with Intelligent Systems Video Boy," details a piece of rare hardware that allows the Nintendo Virtual Boy to be displayed on a television screen. The "Video Boy" is an adapter that intercepts the signals from the Virtual Boy's internal displays and outputs them as a standard video signal, enabling a spectator view or play without the headset's physical discomfort. The article includes photos and technical details about this obscure device, which was never officially released.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the Virtual Boy's legacy as a commercial failure and its niche appeal among retro technology enthusiasts. The conversation is split between personal experiences with the hardware and a broader analysis of why stereoscopic 3D gaming never became mainstream.

Many commenters echo the original poster's sentiment, recalling the Virtual Boy as uncomfortable, nausea-inducing, and visually limited due to its monochrome red display. They describe it as a product that flopped for good reasons, citing its poor ergonomics, lack of a social "spectator" aspect, and unmemorable game library. However, some users share a specific nostalgia for titles like *Wario Land*, which they consider a genuinely good game they never got to fully experience.

A significant portion of the discussion delves into the hardware's unique engineering. Commenters express fascination with the teardown of the Virtual Boy, which revealed it used oscillating mirrors and a bar of micro-LEDs to create its 3D effect, a mechanism often mistaken for lasers. This leads to a technical debate about why the mirror oscillated back-and-forth instead of spinning, with one user speculating that a rotating design would have been too large or mechanically complex.

The conversation pivots to the broader failure of 3D technology in gaming. Users argue that Nintendo's 3DS, while successful, succeeded *despite* its 3D feature, not because of it. The 3D effect was often seen as a gimmick that came with significant drawbacks, such as halving the screen's effective resolution and making the touch screen feel secondary. This leads to a consensus that consumers generally don't want to wear headsets or deal with the limitations of glasses-based 3D for home console gaming.

Finally, a few users look forward, speculating on the potential of modern, low-fi VR concepts inspired by the Virtual Boy. They suggest that focusing on clarity and abstract, minimalist experiences instead of photorealistic color could lead to innovative new applications with lower hardware requirements, a concept they feel is currently overlooked in the VR industry.
