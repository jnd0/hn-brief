## [TikTok users can't upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec)
**Score:** 1208 | **Comments:** 819 | **ID:** 46779809

> **Article:** CNN reports that TikTok users are experiencing difficulties uploading videos critical of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), with the company attributing the issue to technical glitches. The timing is notable as it follows recent developments around TikTok's forced sale to US-based ownership amid ongoing concerns about the platform's relationship with Chinese parent company ByteDance and potential government influence over content moderation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly spiraled into broader debates about censorship, propaganda, and political hypocrisy. Several commenters drew parallels between current US content moderation and historical authoritarian tactics—one vividly recalling their father's reaction to state TV "technical difficulties" during the 1989 Czechoslovak protests. Others noted the irony that the US, after criticizing Chinese censorship for years, appears to be pursuing similar control mechanisms.

A significant thread examined TikTok's algorithmic manipulation as a geopolitical tool. One commenter described testing the platform from South American IPs and observing how anti-US government content gets amplified while Tiananmen Square and Tibet references disappear—characterizing this as "brutally honest propaganda" that leverages real facts for influence. Others pushed back, questioning whether depicting actual US foreign policy actions constitutes propaganda at all.

The conversation also touched on the "Orbanisation" of TikTok following its US acquisition, with reports of "Epstein" being blocked in DMs and users noticing sudden algorithmic resets that wiped their personalized feeds. Some framed this as the inevitable result of building censorship infrastructure—whether originally for Chinese or US interests, the tools exist to be repurposed.

Political polarization surfaced repeatedly, with centrist commenters lamenting the impossibility of nuanced discussion without being labeled, while others dismissed "both sides" framing as false equivalence given right-wing media dominance. Several warned about the dangers of normalizing state violence against designated "bad people," citing historical patterns where such powers expand to target broader populations.

## [Cloudflare claimed they implemented Matrix on Cloudflare workers. They didn't](https://tech.lgbt/@JadedBlueEyes/115967791152135761)
**Score:** 461 | **Comments:** 173 | **ID:** 46781516

> **Article:** A Cloudflare blog post claimed that "Matrix on Workers" had been implemented—a full Matrix homeserver running on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure. However, investigation of the linked GitHub repository revealed this was essentially vaporware: only two commits, code that didn't actually work, TODOs hastily removed when called out, and misleading claims of being "production grade." The author was a Senior Engineering TPM at Cloudflare, not a software engineer, and the code appears to have been AI-generated ("vibe-coded") without proper technical review. Cloudflare has since edited the blog post twice, first adding a "proof of concept" disclaimer while keeping contradictory claims about "real encrypted communications," then removing those claims entirely. The incident follows closely on the heels of a debunked Cursor/GPT-5.2 "browser built from scratch" story, highlighting a pattern of inflated AI-assisted development claims.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centers on credibility erosion in technical marketing, particularly around AI-generated code claims. Commenters quickly identified red flags in the repository: only two commits, TODOs being scrubbed rather than addressed, and an author who appeared not to understand git workflows. Several drew parallels to Cloudflare's previous OAuth library for Workers, which was similarly promoted as "thoroughly reviewed by security experts" yet later had a CVE filed against it—suggesting a pattern where marketing claims about rigorous review processes don't match reality.

The conversation broadened to industry-wide dynamics. Multiple commenters noted that infrastructure companies' technical blogs historically built trust through demonstrated expertise, but "we did X" posts that turn out to be "we prototyped part of X" are becoming tiresome. Some defended Cloudflare's generally high-quality blog output, making this incident stand out as particularly sloppy. Others saw systemic pressure at work: CEOs and shareholders want AI success stories, creating incentives to overstate capabilities.

A productive tangent emerged when embedding-shape, who had previously debunked the Cursor browser story, shared their own counter-example: a functional browser built with a single AI agent in 20K lines of Rust, with working screenshots, CI, and multi-platform support. This served as proof-of-concept that honest, modest claims about AI-assisted development can be substantiated—making the inflated claims elsewhere more glaring by comparison.

The role of the author (a Technical Program Manager, not an engineer) sparked debate about organizational accountability. Some saw this as "shadow IT" or individual overreach; others worried about what else might be "vibe-coded" within Cloudflare's infrastructure. The incident raised questions about review processes—whether blog posts are vetted for technical accuracy, and whether leadership's claimed personal review of all posts actually catches problems. Several commenters noted the damage control attempts (editing commits, amending the blog) arguably compounded the problem by being evasive rather than forthright.

Underlying much of the discussion was frustration with a hype cycle where "disbelief should be the default reaction" to dramatic AI development stories, yet commercial and social incentives push toward credulity. The contrast between what was claimed ("production grade," "real encrypted communications") and what existed (broken, incomplete code) struck many as emblematic of broader tensions in how AI-assisted work is presented versus validated.

## [Kimi Released Kimi K2.5, Open-Source Visual SOTA-Agentic Model](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html)
**Score:** 452 | **Comments:** 218 | **ID:** 46775961

> **Article:** Moonshot AI released Kimi K2.5, an open-source 1 trillion parameter Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 32 billion active parameters. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on visual and agentic benchmarks, including cracking the 50th percentile on the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). It features native INT4 quantization, supports context lengths up to 256,000 tokens (with testing up to 2 million characters), and introduces "K2.5 Agent Swarm" capabilities allowing the model to self-direct up to 100 sub-agents with up to 1,500 parallel tool calls. The model is released under a modified MIT license requiring prominent attribution for products with 100M+ MAU or $20M+ monthly revenue.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion centered on three main themes: the model's massive scale versus practical deployability, the strategic implications of Chinese open-source AI, and the technical realities of running trillion-parameter models locally.

On hardware requirements, commenters debated whether "running at home" was meaningfully achievable. While enthusiasts noted the MoE architecture enables local execution with only 16GB of active parameters at 4-bit precision, others countered that practical use cases—especially agentic workflows—demand serious infrastructure: estimates ranged from $20K for dual Mac Studio Ultras (functional but slow) to $500K-$700K for a 16×H100 cluster for production-grade performance. Several commenters running the model locally reported token generation speeds of 8-9 tokens/second, usable for some tasks but far from ideal for complex agentic work.

The licensing terms drew skepticism, with one commenter questioning why Moonshot didn't simply charge large users $1 million rather than requiring UI attribution. Others viewed this as a clever growth strategy reminiscent of Google's early search widget distribution—trading immediate revenue for brand recognition and ecosystem lock-in.

Strategically, many saw this release as continuing China's "DeepSeek moment" playbook: spending heavily to train frontier models, then open-sourcing them to erode American competitive advantages while advancing Chinese technological and geopolitical interests. Commenters noted this creates relentless pressure on US/EU labs to justify premium pricing while Chinese firms capture usage and mindshare through free alternatives.

The agent swarm capabilities—parallel execution across 100 sub-agents with 1,500 tool calls—impressed technically but raised economic concerns. One practitioner noted that even "a few dozen steps" strains unit economics, questioning how 1,500 calls per task could be viable outside VC-subsidized environments.

## [FBI is investigating Minnesota Signal chats tracking ICE](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041)
**Score:** 449 | **Comments:** 505 | **ID:** 46783254

> **Article:** The FBI is investigating Signal group chats in Minnesota where activists are allegedly coordinating to track and disrupt ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations. The investigation centers on protesters who use the encrypted messaging app to share real-time locations of ICE agents and vehicles. The probe follows recent violent incidents including the fatal shooting of a man by ICE agents in Minneapolis, which sparked protests. Federal authorities are examining whether the coordinated tracking constitutes conspiracy to impede federal officers, while critics argue the investigation itself may chill constitutionally protected speech and assembly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers heavily on the technical and legal implications of using Signal for activist coordination. Multiple participants analyze the privacy model: while Signal's content is encrypted, phone numbers remain visible metadata, creating a vulnerability chain where identifying one participant could expose an entire group chat if that person's unlocked device is compromised. Suggested mitigations include disappearing messages and strong device encryption, though others note these aren't foolproof against compelled decryption or infiltration by informants.

The conversation quickly broadens into constitutional and political territory. Several commenters frame the FBI investigation as an intimidation tactic against protected First Amendment activity, with one citing 18 U.S.C. § 372 (conspiracy to impede officers) as the likely charge. Others counter that investigating potential threats against law enforcement is legitimate government function, with one participant controversially comparing the protest networks to "insurgents the US has fought for decades in the Middle East"—a characterization that drew strong rebuttals about resisting "occupation force" violence.

A significant thread examines government data capabilities and competence. Some express alarm about Palantir and surveillance technology enabling rapid action against protesters, while others argue government inefficiency and bureaucratic incompetence provide practical protection against dystopian outcomes. The discussion also touches on recent events where DOJ attorneys resigned after being directed to investigate shooting victims' families rather than the shootings themselves, fueling concerns about politicized law enforcement.

Technical security debates recur throughout, covering GrayKey device unlocking, GrapheneOS as a hardened alternative, and the fundamental limits of encryption when endpoints are compromised. The conversation concludes with darker speculation about constitutional erosion, with participants noting that even legally protected speech doesn't prevent arrest, pretrial detention, or the chilling effects of investigation itself.

## [U.S. government has lost more than 10k STEM PhDs since Trump took office](https://www.science.org/content/article/u-s-government-has-lost-more-10-000-stem-ph-d-s-trump-took-office)
**Score:** 435 | **Comments:** 319 | **ID:** 46784263

> **Article:** The article from Science.org reports that the U.S. federal government has lost more than 10,000 STEM PhD employees since Donald Trump took office. This represents a significant brain drain of highly educated scientific talent from government agencies, attributed to funding cuts, hostile immigration policies, and broader anti-intellectual sentiment from the administration. The National Science Foundation (NSF) budget was reportedly cut 55% in the first year, and research grants have been slashed across agencies, terminating many international scientific collaborations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharply divided community grappling with whether this government brain drain represents a genuine crisis or a necessary correction. One faction, led by commenter JuniperMesos, challenges the default assumption that losing STEM PhDs is inherently bad, arguing that academia produces substantial low-quality research and that credentialism shouldn't drive federal hiring. This position immediately drew strong rebuttals, most notably from ixtli, who countered that there's no evidence the *least* productive researchers are the ones leaving—in fact, the most talented likely depart first for better opportunities abroad.

The conversation quickly expanded to international comparisons, with multiple commenters noting a striking divergence: while the U.S. and Netherlands hemorrhage scientific talent, China aggressively expands its STEM capacity, graduating engineers at rates far exceeding population-adjusted expectations. A European researcher (adev_) offered particularly pointed analysis, describing how terminated U.S.-EU collaborations are being replaced by EU-China partnerships, effectively transferring American research advantages to its geopolitical rival. This sparked dark irony about Trump administration policies inadvertently strengthening China.

A secondary debate emerged around public versus private sector productivity. Some commenters, echoing DOGE-era rhetoric, suggested PhDs might contribute more in private industry. Others forcefully rejected this framing, with kaitai and JohnFen arguing that "productivity" defined as corporate profit generation ignores essential non-market functions—veterans' healthcare, basic research, and other public goods that markets systematically underprovide. The SpaceX/Rocket Lab examples of private sector innovation were countered with reminders that government funding originally enabled much of this ecosystem.

Underlying much discussion was palpable anxiety about irreversibility. Commenter kevinsync captured this poignantly: even if U.S. policy reversed, would talented researchers return to "a bar where the bouncer kicked the shit out of me"? Several participants expressed broader pessimism about Western scientific infrastructure, with retired engineers describing their own emigration from the Netherlands due to economic unsustainability, suggesting a systemic crisis extending beyond American borders.

The thread concluded with meta-commentary about information environments, with mecsred cautioning against trusting public media to gauge genuine consensus—advice that implicitly questioned whether the very platforms hosting this discussion could be trusted to reflect reality.

## [Prism](https://openai.com/index/introducing-prism)
**Score:** 337 | **Comments:** 207 | **ID:** 46783752

> **Article:** OpenAI has launched "Prism," a web-based LaTeX editor with integrated AI capabilities aimed at academic writing. The tool appears to be a rebranded/evolved version of crixet.com, offering features like AI-assisted writing, bibliography generation, and collaborative editing. It is positioned as a free alternative to Overleaf, the dominant cloud-based LaTeX platform. The AI features include finding and suggesting relevant papers for citation, generating content, and helping with document structure—functionality that OpenAI demonstrates in promotional materials showing quick paper assembly.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep skepticism and concern about Prism, with criticism falling into several interconnected themes.

**Academic Integrity and Journal Spam**
The most heated responses come from academics worried about AI flooding scientific publishing with low-quality submissions. A journal editor describes receiving "vibe-coded" papers from unqualified authors—such as an accounting undergraduate submitting a cosmology paper—wasting the unpaid time of editors and reviewers. Commenters draw parallels to how AI-generated bug reports have overwhelmed bounty programs, with one proposing "Altman's Law": that in the age of AI, 99.999% of everything becomes crap. The core concern is that LLMs lower barriers to producing superficially plausible work without the actual research understanding that constitutes real scholarship.

**Naming Controversy**
Multiple commenters criticize the "Prism" name, noting its collision with both the NSA surveillance program exposed by Edward Snowden and GraphPad Prism, widely-used scientific software. Some suspect intentional provocation; others see obliviousness. The consensus is that the naming shows either poor research or deliberate disregard.

**Comparison to Overleaf**
Technical users debate whether Prism can compete with Overleaf, the established leader. Prism's defenders note its minimalist interface and extensive AI integration, arguing it serves researchers who lack technical sophistication for local LaTeX setups or git workflows. Skeptics counter that Prism lacks Overleaf's mature collaboration features, version history, and reliability—expressing doubt about OpenAI's long-term commitment to what is essentially a loss-leader product. Self-hosting Overleaf emerges as the preferred path for privacy-conscious or cost-sensitive users.

**Deeper Critique of AI-Assisted Writing**
Beyond practical concerns, commenters worry about what AI writing tools encourage. One notes that OpenAI's demo emphasizes "finding papers to decorate the bibliography with" rather than genuine literature engagement—treating citation as performative pageantry. Another describes removing a co-author whose AI-assisted workflow devolved into plagiarism. The fear is that tools like Prism train a generation of researchers to simulate scholarship rather than perform it, with em-dashes and proper formatting becoming markers of "slop fraud" rather than craft.

**Structural Proposals**
Suggested remedies include submission fees refundable upon acceptance to deter spam, though this raises concerns about gatekeeping valuable negative results and paying reviewers for their labor—challenges without easy resolution.

## [Celebrities say they are being censored by TikTok after speaking out against ICE](https://www.pride.com/culture/celebrities/tiktok-censoring-megan-stalter-and-finneas)
**Score:** 326 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46777652

> **Article:** The Pride.com article reports that celebrities including Megan Stalter and Finneas (Billie Eilish's brother) have accused TikTok of censoring their content after they spoke out against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). The claims suggest that posts criticizing immigration enforcement are experiencing reduced reach or visibility on the platform. This comes after TikTok's forced sale to a US entity led by Oracle's Larry Ellison, with close ties to the Trump administration.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals deep polarization about whether this topic belongs on the site and what's actually happening with TikTok's moderation. Early comments express frustration that the post was flagged, with users like iceflinger questioning why a major platform's ownership change and apparent functionality shifts wouldn't warrant tech community discussion. Dudefeliciano and saubeidl suggest flagging reflects political discomfort among government supporters, with saubeidl going so far as to describe a "proto-fascist contingent" suppressing regime criticism.

Jauntywundrkind connects this to broader concerns about the TikTok sale, criticizing the Supreme Court's unanimous decision and predicting "endless utterly preposterous censorship" serving "right wing ultra capitalist agenda" under Ellison's ownership. This triggers a subthread debating capitalism itself—0x3f sarcastically reduces the critique to "capitalism is when bad things happen," while scotty79 offers a more substantive framing of capitalism as a system where capital overrules everything else, including democracy. Tormeh pushes back that this situation resembles mercantilism more than free-market capitalism given heavy government involvement.

The discussion also touches on platform dynamics more generally. Thunky laments the absence of genuine cross-ideological conversation, blaming downvote systems for creating echo chambers. Colpabar controversially praises 4chan's anonymity and lack of voting as preserving space for unexpected perspectives, though archagon counters that anonymous threaded forums with vote-based sorting are inherently unsuited for mind-changing dialogue.

Several users debate whether censorship is actually occurring or if algorithmic opacity makes this unprovable. Baxtr notes the inherent unpredictability of video platform algorithms, while scotty79 doubts ICE-critical content would be suppressed given its audience demographics. Mrtksn counters that documented collusion between tech billionaires and the political class makes intentional throttling plausible. Theshrike79 splits the difference, suggesting encoding issues from Oracle infrastructure migration could explain problems without requiring malice.

Political tensions surface directly when ap99 declares full ICE support and criticizes local politicians obstructing federal law enforcement, prompting saubeidl's comparison to the Gestapo and tastyface's graphic reference to recent controversial shootings by ICE agents. SilverElfin and others emphasize the fundamental opacity of platform algorithms, making anecdotal evidence the only available form of accountability. The discussion concludes with rsynnott's somewhat glib advice that celebrities should simply abandon regime-controlled platforms, and vanviegen's pointed question of where exactly they could go that would resist US government pressure.

## [430k-year-old well-preserved wooden tools are the oldest ever found](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/26/science/archaeology-neanderthals-tools.html)
**Score:** 325 | **Comments:** 182 | **ID:** 46781530

> **Article:** Archaeologists have discovered 430,000-year-old wooden tools in Portugal, representing the oldest well-preserved wooden tools ever found. The tools were made by Neanderthals and include digging sticks and other implements preserved in waterlogged sediments at the Lapa do Picareiro cave site. This discovery pushes back the known timeline for sophisticated woodworking and provides rare direct evidence of organic tool use by early hominins, as wood typically decomposes and leaves little archaeological trace.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion opened with surprise at the 430,000-year date, with user drakythe questioning whether they were reading correctly, as this predates Homo sapiens. This sparked an informative exchange clarifying that tool use extends far deeper into prehistory than many realized. Throwup238 explained that the Oldowan stone tool industry dates back 2–3 million years, and that indirect evidence of woodworking through phytolith and microwear studies already pointed to wooden tool use at least 1.5 million years ago—making this find remarkable primarily for its exceptional preservation rather than representing a radical revision of capabilities.

The conversation took a darker turn when JumpCrisscross introduced Jane Goodall's observation about genocidal tendencies in humans, chimpanzees, and wolves, speculating that humans may have been uniquely intolerant of sharing the world with other hominin species. This prompted both engagement and skepticism, with jama211 calling it unsubstantiated speculation.

A fringe perspective emerged from an0malous, who cited Michael Cremo's "Forbidden Archaeology" to claim even older tool evidence is suppressed by academic dogma. This triggered substantial pushback—drakythe found Cremo's materials off-putting, while others debated whether scientific conservatism represents healthy rigor or harmful gatekeeping. User 3RTB297 offered a nuanced museum professional's view, acknowledging that career incentives and institutional inertia can delay paradigm shifts, citing historical examples from plate tectonics to warm-blooded dinosaurs, while cautioning against equating all fringe claims with suppressed truth.

The discussion also touched on construction materials, with melenaboija reflecting on wood's durability and environmental advantages over concrete, and barbacoa noting the irony that modern rebar-reinforced concrete degrades faster than ancient Roman unreinforced concrete. Other threads explored obsidian's ubiquity in pre-metal societies, the relationship between hunting and farming tool development, and philosophical questions about how humans might react to discoveries that fundamentally challenge established timelines.

## [I made my own Git](https://tonystr.net/blog/git_immitation)
**Score:** 318 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46778341

> **Article:** The author built a simplified Git clone from scratch in Rust as a learning exercise, implementing core version control concepts including blob/tree/commit objects, content-addressable storage with zstd compression, and basic commands like init, add, commit, and log. The project uses YAML for object serialization and SHA-256 for hashing. The writeup explains Git's internal object model and demonstrates how a minimal VCS can be constructed, with the author noting that parsing was surprisingly the hardest part of the implementation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion touched on several interconnected themes around version control systems and AI training. A significant thread emerged around LLM scraping, sparked by the author's observation that their repository had 49 clones from 28 unique users before they even published the article—suggesting automated bots scraping public GitHub repos for training data. This led to darkly humorous suggestions about "poisoning" LLMs with circular self-references and deliberately including bugs in public code.

On the technical side, commenters explored alternative VCS designs. One suggested using SQLite for storage rather than parsing custom formats, which prompted discussion of Fossil SCM—an existing project that takes exactly this approach while maintaining human-readable plaintext for long-term durability. Others debated merge strategies, with praise for Git's underutilized recursive merge and rerere features, while advocates for Pijul argued for making conflicts first-class repository objects. The perennial challenge of Git's ubiquity came up: any new VCS faces an enormous barrier in ecosystem compatibility and user familiarity, leading some to suggest innovating on top of Git's storage layer rather than replacing it entirely.

Performance considerations generated substantive exchange. Commenters noted the author's naive approach of recomputing all file hashes on every operation would struggle at scale, and discussed how Git optimizes through directory sharding and caching. The choice of SHA-256 drew both criticism (it's slow compared to BLAKE3) and defense (hardware acceleration on ARM64 narrows the gap). A deeper point emerged about data modeling: Git's whole-file approach limits deduplication and parallelization, with Content Defined Chunking suggested as a superior alternative for large files.

## [A list of fun destinations for telnet](https://telnet.org/htm/places.htm)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 102 | **ID:** 46775135

> **Article:** A curated list of active Telnet destinations, including ASCII art animations (notably the famous Star Wars ASCII movie), MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), BBSes, and other text-based services accessible via the vintage Telnet protocol.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion blends warm nostalgia for Telnet's "pure" text-based interfaces with practical technical observations about its continuing, if diminished, role in modern computing.

Many commenters trace their technical origins through Telnet. Several describe how manually sending POP3 commands or browsing the web via Telnet led to building their first email clients and web servers. The Star Wars ASCII animation at towel.blinkenlights.nl serves as a common entry point—described as discovering "a secret passage in the internet"—though its current status generated confusion, with some reporting timeouts while others confirmed it runs on IPv6 with added features.

The conversation reveals Telnet's surprising persistence in enterprise environments. One commenter notes it's still used daily inside telecoms for communicating with base stations and network equipment over IP-SEC isolated networks, valued by auditors for session recording capabilities. This professional utility contrasts with its recreational reputation.

Security concerns surface regarding ANSI escape sequences, with debate over whether they present comparable risk to JavaScript in browsers. The practical difficulty of simply running Telnet today—no longer installed by default, requiring repository searches for packages like inetutils-telnet—prompted someone to share a Python implementation using telnetlib3.

MUDs generate particular enthusiasm, with commenters sharing how BatMUD and others consumed their school years, taught them programming, and remain active decades later. The thread captures a recurring sentiment: amid modern web bloat of "AI slop, popups, fake news, propaganda and ads," there's appeal in returning to "just text"—though others note advertisers would inevitably follow even to Gopher or revived text protocols.

## [Xfwl4 – The Roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor](https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_15.html)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46779645

> **Article:** The article outlines the development roadmap for xfwl4, a new Wayland compositor for the Xfce desktop environment. Written by Xfce developer Simon Steinbeiss, it explains the decision to build a new compositor from scratch rather than port xfwm4 (Xfce's existing X11 window manager). The project will be written in Rust using the Smithay library, with goals of maintaining Xfce's traditional lightweight philosophy while embracing modern Wayland architecture. Key priorities include replicating xfwm4's functionality and behavior, ensuring accessibility, and providing a smooth migration path for users. The roadmap covers phases from initial window management through to full feature parity, with careful attention to preserving Xfce's characteristic user experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on whether Xfce's traditionally conservative userbase will accept both Wayland and Rust, with commenters offering sharply divergent perspectives. User jchw expresses optimism about the technical rationale—Rust's memory safety helps prevent compositor crashes, which are particularly problematic in Wayland's architecture—while acknowledging potential skepticism from long-time users. This concern is immediately challenged by coldpie, a 17-year Xfce veteran, who argues that Xfce users simply want things that work reliably rather than caring about implementation details, and predicts the transition will proceed smoothly despite predictable grumbling.

The thread becomes more contentious with ok123456's strongly worded critique characterizing Wayland as a "regression" and "huge diversion of time and resources," dismissing security arguments and criticizing protocol complexity and fragmentation. This sparks a detailed technical rebuttal from jchw, who defends Wayland's protocol-centric design as preventing the "ossification" that plagued X11, praises its first-principles approach to modern display features like HDR and multi-head setups, and acknowledges while the design-by-committee process is slow, the resulting protocols are well-engineered. Jchw also candidly addresses current limitations—missing protocols for session management and window positioning, and the inability to directly embed windows—that frustrate application developers.

A particularly substantive exchange emerges around performance. Fiveplus raises nuanced questions about whether xfwl4 can replicate xfwm4's responsiveness on low-end hardware, noting that Wayland's mandatory compositing eliminates the option to disable compositing that made Xfce snappy on "potato hardware." Jchw responds with technical depth about GPU plane unredirecting and atomic DRM commits, conceding that some latency increase is unavoidable but arguing higher refresh rates and modern optimizations make this acceptable—while acknowledging this leaves 60Hz laptop users with permanent suboptimal latency. PunchyHamster offers a blunt counter that Wayland has "consistently been slower than X11" with no workaround.

Throughout, the discussion reflects broader tensions in Linux desktop evolution: between protocol purity and practical functionality, between security isolation and user flexibility, and between progress and preservation of lightweight performance characteristics that defined Xfce's identity.

## [Russia using Interpol's wanted list to target critics abroad, leak reveals](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20gg729y1yo)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46776454

> **Article:** A BBC investigation based on leaked documents reveals Russia has been systematically using Interpol's "wanted list" to target critics abroad. The article focuses on the case of Dmitry Pestrikov, a Russian businessman who fled to France in 2022 after taking 250 million rubles from his company's budget. He discovered he was on Interpol's Red Notice list after contacting Interpol himself, fearing Kremlin targeting. After nearly two years, Interpol's Commission for the Control of Files (CCF) ruled his case was "predominantly political," noting Russia's information was "generic and formulaic" with inadequate explanation of alleged crimes, and cancelled the detention request. The leak shows Russia has submitted over 2,500 Red Notice requests since 2014, with many targeting individuals who had fled the country. The article notes this abuse is not unique to Russia—Turkey and other authoritarian regimes have similarly exploited Interpol for political purposes.

## [Lennart Poettering, Christian Brauner founded a new company](https://amutable.com/about)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 243 | **ID:** 46784572

> **Article:** Lennart Poettering (creator of systemd) and Christian Brauner have founded a new company called Amutable, based in Berlin. The company's stated mission is "building cryptographically verifiable integrity into Linux systems," with the goal that "every system starts in a verified state and stays trusted over time." The founding team includes several engineers with backgrounds in systemd development and Microsoft. The company has not yet revealed detailed product plans but indicates they are working on Linux-based operating system technology with a focus on security and integrity verification.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was dominated by deep skepticism and concern about Amutable's technology, with commenters drawing parallels to DRM, remote attestation, and potential threats to user freedom. The most immediate reaction was alarm that "cryptographically verifiable integrity" could enable remote third parties to verify and potentially restrict what software users run, echoing Richard Stallman's warnings in "Can You Trust Your Computer?"

Several commenters fixated on the Microsoft connection—both founders' recent employment there and the involvement of systemd maintainers—seeing this as evidence of corporate influence that might not align with user interests. The systemd association proved particularly contentious, reopening old wounds about Lennart Poettering's perceived "arrogance" during systemd's early rollout and fears that Amutable's technology might eventually be pushed through systemd as de-facto mandatory features, following a familiar pattern of "optional" becoming "ubiquitous."

Founding engineers attempted to reassure the community. Aleksa (cyphar) emphasized that their attestation models would give users full control of keys, arguing this was both a freedom issue and practically preferable for enterprise security. Daan DeMeyer, a systemd maintainer, stated they try to make disruptive features opt-in and don't intend to change their open-source commitment, though he acknowledged they don't always succeed.

The debate revealed a fundamental tension: cryptographic integrity tools can serve dual purposes. Proponents noted they could verify server code matches open-source claims (enabling trustworthy cloud services) or protect against evil maid attacks. Critics countered that such capabilities, while not inherently restrictive, historically become tools of control when combined with oligopoly power and network effects—citing smartphone integrity checks, HDCP, Widevine, and vendor-locked Secure Boot as precedents.

A particularly pointed exchange involved whether Microsoft could leverage its hardware influence to mandate key enrollment restrictions, effectively requiring their blessing for Linux distributions to boot. DeMeyer conceded this was outside their control but considered it unlikely.

The discussion also featured predictable systemd flamewar elements, with defenders praising its technical improvements over SysV init and critics citing Devuan's existence as evidence of legitimate dissent. Several commenters expressed resignation that even if Amutable's implementation proves user-hostile, it would likely be "full of security holes" anyway—a dark silver lining.

Underlying much of the anxiety was a sense that Linux desktop users may be witnessing the beginning of enforced attestation requirements for essential services (banking, streaming, gaming), with this technology as the foundation. The founding team's vague "coming months" timeline for details left ample room for speculation, and their Berlin location drew modest enthusiasm as a European tech alternative.

## [The age of Pump and Dump software](https://tautvilas.medium.com/software-pump-and-dump-c8a9a73d313b)

> **Article:** The article "The age of Pump and Dump software" examines a concerning trend where AI-powered coding tools and agentic software projects are being used as vehicles for cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes. The author identifies several projects—notably Gas Town (by former Google engineer Steve Yegge) and Clawdbot/Moltbot—that appear to leverage AI coding hype to attract investment in associated crypto tokens rather than delivering genuine software value. The piece draws parallels between these modern schemes and historical financial frauds, suggesting that the combination of AI-generated code (which lowers barriers to creating seemingly impressive demos), unregulated crypto markets, and social media amplification has created fertile ground for a new class of scams where software itself becomes the speculative asset.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals deep skepticism about AI-coding projects with crypto ties, alongside broader reflections on technology's trajectory. Several users investigated Clawdbot/Moltbot directly, with _pdp_ and thehamkercat uncovering suspicious patterns: spam backlink networks, Reddit astroturfing, critical security vulnerabilities, and chaotic source code management that would make backdoors trivial to introduce. Esskay defended Moltbot as a legitimate rebrand forced by an Anthropic takedown notice, though _pdp_ maintained the new domain showed identical spam-network connections.

The debate split between those seeing outright fraud and those viewing Gas Town as genuine experimentation. Uehreka pushed back against the "damning indictment," noting they'd learned useful orchestration patterns from Gas Town without spending money or touching crypto. Leynos offered a counterthesis framing this as legitimate public experimentation with immature technology—"alien technology" whose proper use remains unknown—citing that Anysphere independently converged on similar supervisor-worker architectures. However, storystarling and simoncion highlighted brutal unit economics: even with subsidized $200/month Claude Max plans, the architecture proved prohibitively expensive, with Yegge himself reportedly needing a second account.

Philosophical threads ran through the discussion. Justonceokay's opening reflection on how future generations might view this era—whether as "Wild West" lawlessness preceding mature interconnection, or as a butlerian jihad moment where thinking machines controlled us—resonated with sergiotapia's Star Trek optimism and bayarearefugee's darker counter about prompt injection vulnerabilities. Bee_rider speculated future RAG AIs might use today's overcomplicated codebases as training data for generating intentionally complex software.

The crypto dimension drew particular ire. Askl acidly noted "VC startups are the original pump and dump software," with goinghjuk citing Matt Levine's formulation: "we give you money, and you give us... nothing (0% stake)." Leggerss tried separating the threads—AI experimentation worth pursuing, crypto coins obviously fraudulent—while struggling to understand why creators engaged beyond "reputation laundering." Avaer, claiming insider experience with ~$1B in scams, argued this represented acceleration of ancient patterns through three forces: unregulated crypto gambling, AI capabilities beyond public comprehension, and social media's capacity to amplify lies until the dump.

Practical applications found defenders. Polishdude20 described using Cursor for rapid computer-vision prototyping to detect ski lift patterns, with isk517 affirming rapid prototyping as generative AI's most viable use case. Yet the dominant mood, captured by noosphr's pithy dismissal ("If it smells like bullshit and looks like bullshit"), suggested the community had developed antibodies against AI-crypto convergence—even as avaer's closing lament about capitalist inevitability hinted that skepticism alone wouldn't stop the cycle.

> **Article:** India and the EU announced a landmark trade agreement after years of negotiations. The deal includes tariff reductions on goods, with India cutting duties on European engineering and chemical products. A separate security and defense pact was also signed, allowing Indian defense technology companies to participate in the EU's "ReArm Europe Readiness2030" defense modernization fund. The agreement includes a mobility framework to ease short-term travel restrictions for professionals between India and the EU, though this is distinct from immigration policy which remains under individual EU member states' sovereignty.

## [Doing the thing is doing the thing](https://www.softwaredesign.ing/blog/doing-the-thing-is-doing-the-thing)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 73 | **ID:** 46776155

> **Article:** The article "Doing the thing is doing the thing" (from softwaredesign.ing) delivers a blunt motivational message: the only way to accomplish something is to actually do it, not to plan, think, talk about, or prepare for it. The core thesis distinguishes between activities that feel productive but aren't (research, preparation, discussion, optimization, announcing intentions) versus the actual work of creation. The author explicitly calls out common avoidance behaviors: "Optimizing your workflow is not doing the thing," "Researching best practices is not doing the thing," "Thinking about doing the thing is not doing the thing." The piece serves as a direct challenge to procrastination disguised as productivity.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals immediate tension around what actually constitutes "doing the thing." The top thread debates whether "doing it badly" counts—mojuba argues that persistent bad performance may signal the activity isn't right for you, while others counter that enjoyment matters more than quality, and that deliberate practice (not just repetition) leads to improvement. TheAlchemist shares a popular HN-derived strategy: intentionally doing something badly to overcome paralysis, then iterating.

Corporate environments complicate this philosophy significantly. gonzalohm warns that shipping something that "just works" can trap you in maintenance hell, admitting they now lie about prototype status until quality meets their standards. dbvn confirms this pattern: "showing someone a prototype too early can cause the whole company to rush you to deploy." This creates a paradox where the article's advice to "just ship" conflicts with organizational realities.

The planning question generates substantial debate. munificent draws a hard line: "Planning is doing the planning thing, but it is not doing the battle thing." Yet augusteo's war story supports this—his team shipped in 4 months from a 2-page spec while competitors spent 8 months on architecture docs, pivoted three times, and disbanded. Still, dakiol pushes back with marathon training as counterexample, and wanderingmind notes that skipping planning causes "Day 2 operations issues." The consensus seems to be that planning has sharply diminishing returns after catching obvious problems.

ADHD experiences surface prominently. zahlman identifies the real struggle not as execution but as "choosing from among many things that I could reasonably consider 'the thing'"—the paradox of choice before starting. llbbdd's joke about printing the article for inspiration (which would itself be "not doing the thing") resonates with this crowd.

The discussion repeatedly references prior art: Dan Harmon's writer's block advice ("write a piece of shit, then be a petty critic"), Ira Glass's "The Gap" between taste and ability, and notably, a strikingly similar HN post from months earlier (arscan links it; crazygringo calls for [dupe] marking). mbsa7 confirms this déjà vu with the specific prior submission.

GenAI introduces new wrinkles. tibbar notes that "doing the thing badly without planning has become so easy" that counterweights are needed, while olliepro admits that using AI increasingly "feels like I didn't do the thing." storystarling observes that while AI makes happy paths trivial, the "gap between prototype and production is actually wider" due to non-determinism and latency issues.

The darkest undercurrent involves organizational dysfunction. jgeada describes management as a "problem admiration society"—endless discussion without action. robofanatic notes the perverse incentive where "people who fall in 'not doing the thing' category... are valued more than those who do the thing," though TuringTest and amarant counter that connecting work to value (sales, communication) is itself valuable, if differently rewarded.

## [iPhone 5s Gets New Software Update 13 Years After Launch](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/iphone-5s-software-update/)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46774108

> **Article:** Apple released a software update for the iPhone 5s—13 years after its 2013 launch—primarily to replace an expired security certificate. The update does not add new features but prevents the device from becoming non-functional due to certificate expiration. This is notable because most companies abandon support for devices this old, and it follows a similar certificate update Apple pushed for the iPhone 5s in 2024.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion largely praises Apple's unusual commitment to legacy device support while debating the practical significance of this particular update. Several users contrasted Apple's approach with the Android ecosystem, where even flagship phones often lose OS support within 18-24 months—though some pushed back that Pixel phones receive timely updates, while others noted persistent Pixel hardware issues. Several commenters clarified that this was purely a certificate fix rather than meaningful software maintenance, with one comparing it to Sony's continued Blu-ray DRM updates for the PS3.

The conversation touched on why Apple might bother: some speculated it was cheaper than handling support tickets or legal liability from bricked phones, while others saw it as genuine corporate responsibility. Several users shared personal experiences with old iPhones—the original poster ran a 5s from 2013-2020, others still use iPhone SE models as daily drivers, and some discussed battery replacement challenges. A recurring tension emerged between appreciation for long support windows and frustration with Apple's walled garden approach, with some arguing obsolete devices should be opened to community support instead. The discussion also surfaced edge cases where old devices were effectively bricked by Apple's account authentication requirements, complicating the rosy narrative of universal legacy support.

## [Clawdbot Renames to Moltbot](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/commit/6d16a658e5ebe6ce15856565a47090d5b9d5dfb6)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 119 | **ID:** 46783863

> **Article:** The GitHub repository "Clawdbot" has been renamed to "Moltbot" following apparent trademark pressure from Anthropic, whose AI assistant is named "Claude." The rename was announced via a commit to the repository. The project is an open-source AI agent that provides autonomous computer control capabilities, including file system access, messaging interfaces (iMessage, Telegram), email (Gmail), and various integrations. It gained significant popularity (70k+ GitHub stars) for its "vibe-coded" approach with minimal guardrails, allowing users to create personalized AI agents with extensive system access.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on three main themes: trademark law, security concerns, and the project's popularity.

**Trademark Issues and Corporate Pressure**
Commenters debated the mechanics of trademark defense, with putlake explaining that companies must actively defend trademarks or risk weakening their rights—suggesting Anthropic reached out to founder Peter Steinberger to request the rename. Mattmaroon illustrated this dynamic with an anecdote about Kellogg suing a food truck "Leggo My Egg Roll" for $15 million after the owners refused a paid rebrand offer, sparking debate about whether such legal aggression is justified. Echelon defended Kellogg's position, noting that trademark dilution could cost far more than litigation and that companies often prefer amicable solutions. The discussion revealed that even "clawbot" was rejected as an alternative, suggesting Anthropic is protective of any "Claw-" prefix.

**Severe Security Criticism**
The dominant theme was alarm about Moltbot's security architecture. Multiple commenters highlighted what Simon Willison termed the "lethal trifecta": combining autonomous agents with access to private data and external communications creates ideal conditions for prompt injection attacks. Jayakumark demonstrated this by successfully injecting a prompt through a fake doctor's office email that made the bot display weather data instead of summarizing—an attack that Google's native Gemini integration blocked but Moltbot allowed. Commenters noted users were buying dedicated Mac Minis for isolation, then undermining this by connecting Gmail and iMessage anyway. Achillean reported exposed Moltbot instances already appearing on Shodan, while Rvz predicted infosec professionals would profit from "vibe coders and crypto bros" deploying insecure software.

**Explaining the Hype**
Several users analyzed why Moltbot attracted 70k stars so rapidly. Manmal attributed this to founder Peter Steinberger's engineering reputation, extensive CLI integrations, macOS/iMessage capabilities, and the entertaining "SOUL.md" personality system. Resfirestar suggested the project particularly resonated with bloggers and content creators who have amplified megaphones, and praised its intuitive plain-text workspace structure for agent management. Others like Sergiotapia dismissed it as "fake crypto based hype."

The thread concluded with dark humor about the rename itself—one user noting that lobsters molt to grow, fitting for a project shedding its "Claude"-derived identity, while another quipped about whether Anthropic or the project paid for the tokens to have Claude write the rename announcement tweet.

## [Amazon closing its Fresh and Go stores](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-closing-fresh-grocery-convenience-150437789.html)
**Score:** 133 | **Comments:** 339 | **ID:** 46781444

> **Article:** Amazon is closing its Amazon Fresh grocery stores and Amazon Go convenience stores, marking a significant retreat from its physical retail grocery ambitions. The company had expanded aggressively into brick-and-mortar grocery with the 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods and subsequent launches of Amazon Fresh and the cashierless Amazon Go stores. The closures represent a major strategic pivot away from these formats, though Amazon will continue operating Whole Foods Market.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN discussion reveals widespread skepticism about Amazon's grocery execution, with commenters identifying multiple failure points across operations, technology, and business strategy.

**Operational mediocrity dominated complaints.** Bluecobra's detailed critique of Amazon Fresh described poorly managed stores with expired products, unhelpful staff overwhelmed by online order fulfillment, and a general absence of visible management. Justonceokay's experience in Seattle highlighted a deeper problem: Amazon built stores that solved checkout friction with "smart carts" while failing at core grocery fundamentals—stocking essential low-margin cooking ingredients like baking powder and soy sauce, and replacing personable local ownership with surveillance-heavy European managers with clipboards.

**The "Just Walk Out" technology collapse drew particular scorn.** Multiple commenters noted that Amazon's much-hyped cashierless system, presented as AI-powered computer vision, was revealed to rely on approximately 1,000 Indian workers manually reviewing transactions. This "fake AI" revelation—first reported in April 2024—undermined trust and suggested the economics never worked. Mjr00 speculated that rising outsourcing costs post-COVID, combined with computer vision failing to reach viable performance, made the model unsustainable. Freedomben captured the consumer psychology: the surveillance-heavy experience made honest shoppers feel like presumed thieves, with "a thousand high powered lawyers... waiting for some mess up."

**Predatory pricing suspicions surfaced repeatedly.** Randycupertino and others documented prices so low—$0.25 avocados, Barilla pasta at $0.85—that they appeared designed to operate at losses to destroy local competition, with the classic "bleed out competition, then raise prices" playbook. Lelandfe reinforced this with a parallel story of Amazon duping a trucker device inventor, selling knockoffs at half price until he agreed to list on their platform.

**Urban grocery culture misunderstandings generated debate.** PaulHoule's praise for Wegmans demonstrating "what a real supermarket looks like" to NYC residents prompted hshdhdhj4444's sharp rebuttal: dense, walkable neighborhoods with specialized local vendors (bakers, delis, grocers) function on entirely different logic than car-centric suburban supermarkets. The Navy Yard Wegmans location—remote from transit—actually proved this point, serving car-dependent areas rather than displacing the bodega ecosystem.

**Community damage and accountability gaps drew anger.** G947o described Amazon demolishing existing stores for Fresh locations that never opened, leaving "giant empty storefronts." Nebula8804 connected this to the HQ2 fiasco, where cities performed "dog and pony shows" for a decision Bezos had apparently already made, praising AOC's initially-mocked resistance as ultimately vindicated.

The thread also captured smaller indignities: the absurdity of "Amazon 4-Star" branding (nayroclade noted it sounded like "the Amazon Not-too-bad store"), return policy loopholes ripe for abuse, and the broader "enshittification" hitting even beloved retailers like Wegmans. What emerges is a portrait of Amazon applying its tech-industry playbook—growth-at-all-costs, automation theater, and platform leverage—to a sector requiring operational excellence, community trust, and patient capital, with predictable results.
