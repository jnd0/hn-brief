# HN Daily Digest - 2026-01-12

The most alarming development today isn't a technical glitch but a political one: Jerome Powell's public statement defending the Federal Reserve against DOJ threats of criminal indictment over headquarters renovations. This isn't about construction costs—it's a blatant attempt to strong-arm the central bank into lowering interest rates. Powell explicitly framed it as retaliation for setting policy based on economic data rather than presidential preference, which should terrify anyone who cares about institutional independence. The HN consensus sees this as a slide toward banana-republic tactics, where the "plumbing" of government gets dismantled for short-term political wins. Even if you've disagreed with Powell's past decisions, his stand here is a rare moment of actual backbone in public service.

Meanwhile, Apple users are still fighting a losing battle against the company's design decay. The macOS Tahoe window-resizing debacle—where dragging a corner feels like wading through molasses—isn't new, but it crystallizes a decade of iOS-ification rot. Power users shared workarounds like Option-clicking corners or installing Rectangle, but the real takeaway is how Apple treats the Mac as a "wrinkled" relic to be smoothed into uselessness. This ties directly into the iCloud Photos Downloader tool's popularity: Apple's data export is so deliberately cumbersome that open-source CLI tools become essential. The split in HN comments is telling—some insist official GDPR archives exist, but most share horror stories of crashed exports and week-long waits. It’s a pattern: Apple’s ecosystem now prioritizes lock-in over utility, forcing users to build their own escapes.

Over in AI-land, the industry's growing pains are on full display. Anthropic’s ToS drama—banning use of Claude Code to build competitors—sparked outrage until folks realized it’s mostly anti-abuse theater. The real issue isn’t stifling competition but preventing API moochers from reselling Max plans. Still, the hypocrisy stings: companies that scraped the entire internet now clutch pearls over others "stealing" their tech. Elsewhere, the "next two years of software engineering" debate pits AI evangelists against pragmatists. Yes, LLMs accelerate boilerplate, but calling juniors "AI-proficient" ignores that hiring freezes, not skill gaps, are the real problem. And the "code is cheap" article—likely AI-generated itself—preaches orchestration over syntax, but misses that the hard part was never code; it was understanding what to build.  

On the infrastructure front, Meta’s nuclear pivot is pure pragmatism: AI needs power, and renewables can’t scale yet. Cynics noted this isn’t charity—it’s privatizing public grids, raising prices for everyone else. BYD’s $16k EV with LiDAR underscores how Western manufacturers are getting lapped on price and tech, tariffs or not. And Iran’s Starlink shutdown proves that satellite internet’s Achilles’ heel isn’t tech—it’s physics. When regimes jam frequencies, even Musk’s constellation can’t bypass a determined kill switch.  

Amid the chaos, two gems celebrate engineer ingenuity. The 13KB polyglot game—running as Windows EXE, Linux script, and HTML—recalls the demoscene’s glory days, where size constraints bred genius. And the "FUSE is All You Need" idea, while dismissed by some as slow, tempts with Unix tools on any API. If you’ve ever `grep`-ed a database or `ls`-ed Notion, you get the appeal.  

Finally, the Poison Fountain anti-AI tactic—poisoning training data—feels like a doomed gesture. Labs will filter it, and RLHF already mitigates bad data. But it highlights a growing tension: creators vs. crawlers. As Xfce’s resurgence shows (snappy, stable, no-nonsense), engineers still crave control. When systems bloat or politicize, we retreat to what works.  

**Worth watching**: Powell’s standoff. If the Fed folds, every market signals chaos.
