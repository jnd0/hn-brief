## [If you put Apple icons in reverse it looks like someone getting good at design](https://mastodon.social/@heliographe_studio/115890819509545391)
**Score:** 742 | **Comments:** 283 | **ID:** 46663338

> **Article:** The post links to a Mastodon image showing the evolution of Apple's Pages app icon in reverse order. The visual argument is that as the icons become more illustrative and detailed (moving from the current simple design to older, skeuomorphic styles), it looks like a designer is "getting good" at their craft, implying that older, more detailed icons were more skillful or expressive than the current minimalist trend.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the trade-offs between skeuomorphic (illustrative) and flat/minimalist icon design, with a general consensus that the ideal lies somewhere in the middle.

Many commenters argue that the older, more detailed icons were clearer and more intuitive. They contend that modern icons have become too abstract and simplistic, losing recognizability and failing to convey their function without prior knowledge. A specific critique is that current designs often rely on brand-specific colors or shapes (like the Apple Pencil) rather than universal symbolism, making them less accessible. Some users expressed frustration with the homogenization of icon design across the industry, where apps look too similar and become difficult to distinguish.

Conversely, others defended minimalist design, suggesting that skeuomorphism can feel dated and that modern design principles prioritize clarity and integration with the overall user interface. The debate touched on the purpose of an icon: one viewpoint is that an icon should directly represent its function, while another is that an icon's primary role is to evoke a concept and become a recognizable symbol through user familiarity.

A few commenters shared personal experiences with icon design, highlighting the difficulty of balancing aesthetic appeal with functional clarity and the challenges of managing subjective feedback. The conversation also briefly touched on the idea of user agency, with some suggesting users should be able to customize or freeze their UI, though this was debated against the benefits of a unified design system.

## [jQuery 4](https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/)
**Score:** 647 | **Comments:** 208 | **ID:** 46664755

> **Article:** The article announces the release of jQuery 4.0.0. The post highlights the library's continued maintenance and evolution, specifically noting the migration to ES modules while maintaining backward compatibility, including support for Internet Explorer 11 (which is slated for removal in version 5.0).
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reflects a mix of nostalgia, practical analysis, and debate regarding jQuery's relevance in the modern web ecosystem.

A central theme is the tension between backward compatibility and modern efficiency. Users praised jQuery for supporting legacy environments like IE11 and older school computer labs, acknowledging that not everyone has access to modern hardware. However, this was contrasted with a critique of the library's size; one commenter noted that even at 27 kB (minified and gzipped), it is significantly larger than modern alternatives like Preact (4.7 kB). Counter-arguments defended the size by pointing out that jQuery includes robust features and legacy support, whereas modern frameworks often require additional ecosystem dependencies that bloat the total bundle size far beyond the framework itself.

There was also a strong sentiment of appreciation for jQuery's role in the history of web development. Many commenters credited jQuery with making web development enjoyable and accessible, noting that it "tamed" the chaotic browser ecosystem of the past and served as a reliable career foundation. Conversely, the release sparked jokes about the longevity of JavaScript frameworks, with users sarcastically predicting that React will still be around in 2060.

Finally, the conversation touched on practical usage and alternatives. Some users noted that WordPress is already planning to update to jQuery 4, while others discussed lightweight drop-in replacements like Zepto.js. There was also a mention of "reactive jQuery" patterns as a way to organize legacy codebases, with the consensus that while jQuery can prevent spaghetti code, modern frameworks have generally raised the standard for code quality.

## [Iconify: Library of Open Source Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
**Score:** 474 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46665411

> **Article:** The article links to Iconify, a comprehensive library of open source icons. It functions as a unified interface that aggregates thousands of icons from dozens of popular open source icon sets (such as Material Design Icons, Font Awesome, and many others) into a single, searchable database. The site allows users to easily browse, search, and copy icons in various formats, simplifying the process of finding and using high-quality vector icons in web and application development.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive, with users confirming the utility of Iconify as a convenient aggregator that solves the problem of searching across multiple disparate icon libraries. A recurring theme is the debate over the "best" default icon library, with several users expressing a preference for Material Icons due to its extensive coverage and neutral style, while others mentioned Phosphor Icons as a strong alternative.

The conversation then shifts to a more technical topic: the performance implications of using icons, specifically regarding Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). A user initiated a thread on the "rabbit hole" of icon optimization, highlighting that improper implementation can cause layout shifts. The ensuing discussion covered best practices, such as reserving space by setting explicit width and height attributes on icons to prevent CLS. There was also a nuanced debate on the trade-offs of inlining SVGs directly into the HTML DOM versus using external files, with participants weighing the benefits of avoiding extra HTTP requests against the cost of increased DOM size and the loss of browser caching.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 428 | **Comments:** 351 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy. It analyzes the company's potential need for new revenue streams to support its massive infrastructure costs and valuation, suggesting that ads are a likely future, particularly for lower or free tiers of ChatGPT. The author explores potential ad formats, such as sponsored answers or product placements within AI responses, while acknowledging the significant risks of eroding user trust and brand integrity. The piece concludes that while ads seem inevitable for scaling, the execution will be critical in determining whether it enhances or degrades the user experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical of the premise that advertising is a viable or desirable path for OpenAI, focusing on the potential negative consequences and the current state of the AI market.

A dominant theme is the rejection of ads in AI interfaces. Users express a strong preference for disconnecting from ad-saturated ecosystems, suggesting that the only way to protest is to "not participate" or to support open-source, locally-run models that can remain ad-free. There is a consensus that injecting ads into AI interactions would degrade the product's integrity and trustworthiness, with one user noting that it would be a "considerable distraction" from the pursuit of AGI.

Another key point of debate is the financial viability of an ad-based model. Some commenters argue that the potential ad revenue is insufficient to justify the massive valuations and infrastructure costs, pointing to an "AI bubble." Others discuss the market dynamics, noting that premium users—who are most valuable to advertisers—are also the ones most likely to pay for an ad-free experience, creating a difficult business model conflict similar to Google's.

Finally, the discussion touches on the broader implications for the industry and user trust. Commenters express concern about the subtle, persuasive power of ads integrated into trusted AI responses, calling it an "advertiser's wet dream." There is also a cynical view that the move to ads signals that AGI is not imminent, framing it as a pragmatic business necessity rather than a technological breakthrough. The conversation concludes with a mix of pessimism about the future of commercial AI and optimism about the potential for open-source alternatives to provide a cleaner alternative.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 408 | **Comments:** 403 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The article is a joint statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It addresses recent comments by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the acquisition of Greenland from Denmark. The statement reaffirms the nations' commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, emphasizing the "inviolability of borders" and the "sovereignty and territorial integrity" of all states. It concludes by stating that the signatory nations are committed to working with the United States on these fundamental principles.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of President Trump's threats against Greenland, viewing the statement as a necessary but insufficient response from European allies. The conversation can be broken down into several key themes:

*   **Condemnation of Trump's Actions:** The dominant sentiment is that Trump's rhetoric is "appalling," "disgraceful," and "monstrous." Users express sympathy for European allies, with one commenter noting that the U.S. is betraying nations like Denmark, which lost soldiers fighting alongside America in NATO missions. There is a strong sense of shame and apology from American commenters.
*   **Analysis of Trump's Motivation:** Users speculate on Trump's strategy. Some view it as a classic negotiation tactic of demanding something extreme to gain leverage for a lesser concession. Others suggest it is a deliberate effort to normalize Putinism and authoritarian expansionism. A recurring theory is that the controversy is a "distraction" designed to divert public attention from other scandals, specifically the Epstein files.
*   **Debate on U.S. Political Efficacy:** A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the inability of the U.S. political system to check the President's power. Some commenters express a sense of hopelessness, arguing that laws no longer matter and that even a fully opposition-controlled Congress would be ignored. Others remain hopeful that upcoming midterm elections can provide a check on his power, though this is met with skepticism.
*   **Historical Parallels and Geopolitical Consequences:** Commenters draw parallels to historical empires (Rome, UK) collapsing from internal hubris rather than external enemies. There is a discussion on the potential economic consequences, with some arguing that an invasion of a NATO ally would be economic suicide for the U.S. due to Europe's economic leverage and ownership of U.S. debt, while others doubt Trump considers such consequences.
*   **Criticism of European Response:** While most supported the statement, a minority of commenters were cynical, dismissing it as typical bureaucratic inaction or "weak." However, another user pushed back against this, framing it as a common right-wing talking point and expressing confidence that Europe will ultimately call the U.S.'s bluff.

## [Gaussian Splatting – A$AP Rocky "Helicopter" music video](https://radiancefields.com/a-ap-rocky-releases-helicopter-music-video-featuring-gaussian-splatting)
**Score:** 296 | **Comments:** 107 | **ID:** 46670024

> **Article:** The article discusses the release of A$AP Rocky's music video for "Helicopter," which prominently features Gaussian Splatting, a novel 3D rendering technique. The video was created by scanning actors in a volumetric capture setup using over 50 cameras. This data was processed into a 3D point cloud (Gaussian Splat) and manipulated using software like Houdini and OctaneRender. This allowed the production team to composite actors into surreal environments and relight them in post-production with high flexibility, despite the massive data requirements (10TB for 30 minutes of footage). The article highlights that the technology is now mature enough for high-end commercial production, with the "Helicopter" video serving as a striking example of its surreal, "Unreal Engine-like" aesthetic.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was a mix of technical analysis, aesthetic appreciation, and general curiosity about the music video. 

**Technical Breakdown and Corrections**
Several users clarified the distinction between Gaussian Splatting and NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields). While both are radiance field techniques used for novel view synthesis, Gaussian Splatting uses an explicit point cloud representation (millions of 3D ellipsoids) rather than a neural network inference. A creator of GSOPs (a Houdini toolset for Gaussian Splatting) chimed in to explain that Houdini's strength in manipulating vast point clouds makes it ideal for this data. Users also discussed the current limitations, noting that while the technology is fast and flexible, it can suffer from temporal inconsistencies (flickering) and artifacts, especially when relighting dynamic scenes.

**Aesthetic and Production Value**
Opinions on the visual style were divided. Some felt the render looked like an "old version of Unreal Engine" or a video game, questioning its realism. However, others argued that the surreal, slightly uncanny aesthetic was an intentional artistic choice to lean into the technology's unique artifacts. The consensus was that this approach offers immense flexibility—allowing for camera movements and lighting changes impossible with traditional filming or drone shots—though it comes at a high computational cost.

**General Sentiment and Context**
The community expressed surprise and delight at seeing a mainstream hip-hop artist on Hacker News. While some debated the quality of A$AP Rocky's album *Don't Be Dumb*, the video itself was widely praised as a "great piece of work" and a significant milestone for volumetric capture in media production. Several users recommended external resources (like Corridor Crew videos) for those seeking a deeper understanding of the technology.

## [Erdos 281 solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro](https://twitter.com/neelsomani/status/2012695714187325745)
**Score:** 283 | **Comments:** 265 | **ID:** 46664631

> **Article:** A Twitter user, Neel Somani, claimed that "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro" solved Erdos Problem 281, an open mathematical problem. The post links to the Twitter announcement rather than a formal paper. The claim gained attention due to the involvement of renowned mathematician Terence Tao, who initially reviewed the solution and gave it a "thumbs up," calling it an impressive and error-free application of LLMs to a delicate mathematical problem. However, the situation evolved when it was discovered that the problem was actually solved in a 1936 paper by Davenport and Erdos himself, meaning the LLM did not produce a novel result but rather rediscovered existing literature.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolved around the validity of the LLM's mathematical "breakthrough" and the broader implications of AI in logic and coding. The conversation quickly pivoted from the initial excitement to a more nuanced reality check.

The most significant update in the thread was the discovery that the problem was not actually new. A commenter noted that Terence Tao later updated the status on the Erdos Problems wiki, moving the result to a "Section 2" (known results) after realizing it followed from a 1936 paper. This tempered the initial enthusiasm, highlighting a key risk of LLMs: they can generate proofs that appear novel but are actually rediscoveries of obscure existing literature.

Despite this specific instance being a "false breakthrough," the discussion broadly affirmed the growing capability of AI in logical domains. Commenters debated whether this was "true intelligence" or just advanced pattern matching, with many agreeing that the distinction might be semantic. The conversation extended to software engineering, where several developers shared personal anecdotes of shipping code with significantly less manual coding, suggesting that AI is already transforming technical work.

Finally, users analyzed why Erdos problems are a common benchmark for AI. They concluded that the list offers a wide spectrum of difficulties, ranging from "low-hanging fruit" suitable for current AI to extremely hard problems, making it an ideal testing ground for measuring AI's progress in mathematical reasoning.

**Score:** 215 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46665310

> **Article:** The article "ThinkNext Design" on thinknextdesign.com appears to be a retrospective on the design history of IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops, likely featuring an interview with a key designer. It focuses on the evolution of the iconic design language, including specific models and aesthetic elements like the "swooping" mid-1990s designs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the enduring legacy and current state of ThinkPad laptops, with a mix of nostalgia for older models and criticism of modern Lenovo management. Users express strong brand loyalty, often preferring used or refurbished older ThinkPads (like the T480s or X1) for their durability, repairability, and classic keyboard, referring to them as "timeless" and reliable "servers." However, there is significant frustration with modern iterations; common complaints include poor Linux compatibility regarding sleep modes and Wi-Fi, the use of plastic cases that warp over time, and Lenovo's perceived decline in quality control and customer support. While some users defend the classic plastic design as integral to the brand's identity, others note that newer models like the X13 have adopted aluminum casings. The conversation also touches on specific hardware grievances, such as the imprecision of the "Precision Wireless Travel Mouse" and the annoyance of the bright red Lenovo boot logo.

**Score:** 174 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46664638

> **Article:** The article links to a Wikipedia page detailing the longest word ever to appear in literature: the 171-letter Greek compound word "Lopado­temacho­selacho­galeo­kranio­leipsano­drim­hypo­trimmato­silphio­karabo­melito­katakechy­meno­kichl­epi­kossypho­phatto­perister­alektryon­opte­kephallio­kigklo­peleio­lagoio­siraio­baphe­tragano­pterygon." The word, which appears in Aristophanes' comedy *Assemblywomen*, is a fictional dish consisting of a combination of fish, meat, birds, and sauces.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the technical side effects of posting such a long, unbroken string of characters on Hacker News, specifically how it broke the layout of the mobile site by forcing the page width to expand beyond the screen size. Users shared recommendations for third-party mobile clients to avoid this issue and debated whether the title could be edited to include hyphens to allow for line wrapping.

Beyond the technical glitch, commenters engaged in a lighthearted comparison of other long words, citing English examples like "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" and "antidisestablishmentarianism," as well as referencing long place names and the invented vocabulary in James Joyce's *Finnegans Wake*. The tone remained humorous, with users making jokes about the word being a new pharmaceutical drug or a recipe, and one user posting a string of similarly nonsensical "long" English words in a parody of verbose language.

## [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46666283

> **Article:** The article links to "Consent-O-Matic," a browser extension designed to automate the process of rejecting non-essential cookies on websites. Instead of simply hiding cookie pop-ups or automatically accepting them, the extension navigates the site's consent menus to select "Reject All" or the most privacy-preserving options available, aiming to comply with GDPR requirements without user interaction.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a fragmented landscape of cookie banner solutions, with users debating the trade-offs between convenience, privacy, and website functionality. The primary alternative mentioned is uBlock Origin's "cookie notices" filter list, which hides pop-ups but, as some users noted, can break website functionality and lacks the granular control that Consent-O-Matic offers.

A major theme is the distinction between merely hiding banners and actively managing consent. Several users criticized extensions like "I don't care about cookies" for potentially defaulting to accepting tracking to ensure site compatibility, a significant privacy risk given modern browser fingerprinting. In contrast, Consent-O-Matic is praised for attempting to automate the "Reject All" flow, though some users reported it doesn't always work or still results in frequent pop-ups.

Beyond specific tools, the discussion broadened to critique the state of GDPR compliance. Users expressed frustration that "consent theater"—unnecessary banners appearing even on sites that don't track—is now the norm. This is seen as a failure of understanding the regulations, leading to user fatigue where "accept all" becomes the default action, defeating the law's intent. The conversation highlights a desire for a more seamless, privacy-respecting web that doesn't rely on constant user intervention.

## [Flux 2 Klein pure C inference](https://github.com/antirez/flux2.c)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46670279

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Flux 2 Klein pure C inference," a project by developer Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez). It is a C implementation of the inference pipeline for the Flux.2 image generation model from Black Forest Labs. The project is presented as an experiment in using an LLM (specifically Anthropic's Opus) to generate a complete, functional C codebase for a complex task like a transformer-based image generator. The goal is to provide a lightweight, dependency-free alternative to the typical Python-based stacks, making powerful image generation models more accessible and easier to embed in other applications.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on three main themes: the implications of AI-generated code, the methodology of using LLMs for large-scale development, and the practical aspects of the project itself.

A significant portion of the conversation explores the dual nature of this technology. Commenters express both excitement about the potential to embed advanced image generation in applications like game engines and concern about its proliferation. The quality and reliability of AI-generated code is a key debate. While some express skepticism about maintainability and the tendency of LLMs to produce flawed logic, others argue that with modern models like Opus 4.5 and proper guidance (e.g., a detailed `CLAUDE.md` file), the code can be of high quality. The author, antirez, confirms that maintaining a constantly updated specification file was crucial for the project's success.

The discussion also delves into the process of "vibe coding." Antirez shares his experience, emphasizing the need for a persistent, updated specification and iterative feedback with the LLM. Other developers chime in with their own practices, such as using one model to generate code and another to audit it for errors. A related point was raised about a similar AI-assisted port of this project to Swift, highlighting the trend of cross-language translation using LLMs.

Finally, commenters addressed the project's practical value and licensing. Some questioned its performance advantage, noting that Python libraries are often just C/C++ wrappers, so the speedup might be minimal. Others were interested in its potential to bypass the complex Python dependency stack. A minor point of discussion was the project's MIT license versus the original Flux code's Apache license, with antirez clarifying that his implementation is a from-scratch inference engine, not a direct derivative of the reference code.

## [Starting from scratch: Training a 30M Topological Transformer](https://www.tuned.org.uk/posts/013_the_topological_transformer_training_tauformer)
**Score:** 116 | **Comments:** 26 | **ID:** 46666963

> **Article:** The article introduces the "Tauformer," a 30 million parameter Transformer variant that replaces standard dot-product attention with a topology-based mechanism. Instead of calculating attention scores via vector similarity, the model uses a fixed graph Laplacian matrix derived from token embeddings to compute scalar distances. This approach aims to reduce computational complexity and memory usage (specifically KV cache size) by transforming the attention problem into a 1D energy comparison, potentially offering a more efficient way to model token relationships beyond simple linear positional encoding.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the architectural validity, scalability, and benchmarking of the Tauformer. Commenters are intrigued by the concept of using topological data analysis to enrich the model's understanding of locality and non-linear relationships between tokens, moving beyond the limitations of standard positional embeddings.

However, skepticism is prevalent regarding the practical utility and scalability of the method. A key point of contention is the reliance on a fixed, non-learned matrix (the graph Laplacian) to map tokens into the linear attention space. Critics argue that for the model to scale to larger problems, this matrix would likely need to grow or be trained, which could negate the efficiency gains and make the architecture resemble a conventional Transformer but with harder training dynamics.

Regarding benchmarking, users noted the lack of direct comparisons to vanilla Transformers of similar size or FLOPs budgets. While the 30M parameter model shows promise, there is doubt whether the performance gains would persist at larger scales (e.g., 30B parameters). Several commenters suggested that the most effective way to validate the architecture would be to retrain an existing large model (like a 72B parameter model) using this attention mechanism to enable apples-to-apples comparisons, rather than testing only on small-scale "toy" problems.

The discussion also briefly touched on alternative ideas for improving model efficiency, such as modifying tokenization to include more semantic context (e.g., LSP data), though these were viewed as separate challenges from the core attention mechanism addressed by the Tauformer.
