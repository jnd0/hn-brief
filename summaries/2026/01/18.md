## [If you put Apple icons in reverse it looks like someone getting good at design](https://mastodon.social/@heliographe_studio/115890819509545391)
**Score:** 727 | **Comments:** 277 | **ID:** 46663338

> **Article:** The content is a Mastodon post featuring a side-by-side comparison of Apple's Pages app icon evolving over time. The post's caption humorously suggests that reversing the chronological order (from modern to old) makes it look like someone is "getting good at design," implying the older, more detailed icons are superior to the current minimalist style.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the merits of different icon design philosophies, specifically the evolution from detailed, illustrative styles (skeuomorphism) to modern, minimalist flat design. Commenters are sharply divided, but a common thread is that the "middle ground" of this evolution was likely the optimal point.

Several distinct themes emerged:
*   **The "Sweet Spot" Theory:** Many users argued that the best icons balance clarity and simplicity. They felt the earliest icons were too illustrative and busy, while the latest ones are too abstract and basic to be instantly recognizable. The middle-era icons were praised for being clear, well-branded, and effective.
*   **Skeuomorphism vs. Minimalism:** A core debate was the value of skeuomorphic design (icons that look like real-world objects). Proponents argued it's more intuitive and user-friendly, citing studies that support its clarity. They criticized modern flat design as a soulless, cost-cutting trend that sacrifices usability for aesthetics. Others countered that this view can be arrogant and that minimalism has its own design principles.
*   **Recognizability and Affordance:** A key point was that an icon's primary job is to evoke a concept and be easily distinguishable among other icons. Commenters criticized modern icons for becoming too uniform (like Google's) or so abstract that they rely on users' memory of previous versions to be understood.
*   **Personal Anecdotes:** The conversation was enriched by personal stories, including a designer who shared their frustrating experience creating icons by committee and another who found the older "inkwell" icon more practical for verbal instructions ("click on the ink with the pen").
*   **User Control:** A minor theme was the desire for users to be able to "freeze" their UI or theme their icons, with some noting that while this was more common in the past, the industry has moved toward a unified, consistent design experience for simplicity.

## [jQuery 4](https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/)
**Score:** 592 | **Comments:** 196 | **ID:** 46664755

> **Article:** The article announces the release of jQuery 4.0.0. While the specific details of the release are not provided in the HN post, the discussion implies it includes updates such as ES module migration and a "slim" build that excludes certain modules like Ajax and effects.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding jQuery 4.0.0 is largely nostalgic and pragmatic, acknowledging the library's enduring legacy while contrasting it with modern web development standards.

**Legacy Support and Compatibility**
A primary point of debate is jQuery's continued support for Internet Explorer 11, which is slated for deprecation in version 5.0. While some users find this surprising, others defend it as necessary for backward compatibility, citing environments like school computer labs and legacy enterprise products that still rely on older hardware and software.

**Size and Performance Comparisons**
Users compared the library's size (27 kB minified/gzipped) to modern alternatives like Preact (4.7 kB). While jQuery is significantly larger, commenters argued that it offers a comprehensive feature set for its size. There was skepticism about the "lightweight" nature of modern frameworks, noting that real-world usage of virtual DOM libraries often requires additional ecosystem code that bloats the total bundle size far beyond the framework itself.

**Nostalgia and Career Impact**
Many long-time developers expressed gratitude for jQuery, crediting it with making web development enjoyable and accessible during the pre-Node.js and pre-React eras. It is viewed by many as a foundational tool that enabled their careers. However, the conversation also included jokes about the longevity of modern frameworks, with one user sarcastically predicting React will still be around in 2060.

**Modern Alternatives and Code Quality**
The discussion touched on modern approaches to managing legacy jQuery codebases, specifically referencing "reactive jQuery" patterns to avoid "spaghetti code." While some found these patterns helpful for legacy maintenance, others noted that native browser APIs (like `querySelector` and `addEventListener`) could often replace jQuery entirely in these scenarios. There was a consensus that while React raised the bar for code organization, it can sometimes be over-engineered compared to a well-structured jQuery implementation.

**Ecosystem Context**
Users noted that jQuery remains deeply integrated into the web ecosystem, particularly within WordPress, though WordPress is reportedly moving toward version 4.

## [Iconify: Library of Open Source Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
**Score:** 449 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46665411

> **Article:** The article links to Iconify, a comprehensive library of open source icons. It aggregates thousands of icons from dozens of popular open source icon sets (such as Material Design Icons, Font Awesome, and many others) into a single, searchable interface. The site allows developers to easily browse, search, and copy SVG code or usage snippets for various frameworks, acting as a unified source for a wide variety of icon styles and themes.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive, with users confirming the utility of Iconify as a convenient aggregator for diverse icon needs. While many commenters express a preference for specific libraries—most commonly Material Icons due to its extensive coverage and neutral style—others recommend alternatives like Phosphor Icons. The conversation also delves into technical best practices for icon implementation. A key point of debate is how to handle icons to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). One user suggests inlining SVGs to avoid layout shifts, while others caution that this can bloat the DOM and prevent caching, recommending instead the use of explicit width/height attributes or aspect-ratio properties to reserve space properly. Several users share personal projects and specific use cases, highlighting the library's versatility.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 395 | **Comments:** 305 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy to monetize its services, particularly for free or lower-tier users. The author posits that while ads are an inevitable business move to support massive infrastructure costs and justify high valuations, they will likely be introduced carefully to avoid alienating users. The piece suggests that ads might appear as subtle "sponsored" links or integrations within ChatGPT's responses, rather than intrusive pop-ups. It also argues that the introduction of ads might ironically signal that true AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is not imminent, as the need for ad revenue implies the technology still relies on traditional business models rather than revolutionary economic disruption.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of cynicism, pragmatism, and concern regarding the prospect of advertising in AI interfaces. A dominant theme is the skepticism about the current AI valuation bubble; commenters argue that even significant ad revenue would not justify the astronomical market expectations, suggesting the industry is over-leveraged on hype. There is a strong ethical and user-experience concern regarding the "double billing" of premium subscribers who might still be exposed to ads, with many users stating they would abandon the platform if ads intruded on paid tiers.

The conversation also explores the broader implications of ad-driven AI. Some users view the move toward ads as a pragmatic necessity for OpenAI to secure capital for hardware and scaling, while others see it as a degradation of the product's integrity. A particularly worrying point raised is the potential for "native advertising" within LLM outputs—where sponsored content is indistinguishable from organic answers—creating a trust crisis for users who rely on AI for objective information. Finally, the discussion touches on counter-movements, such as the push for local, open-source models that offer privacy and ad-free experiences, as a way to opt out of the "corrupted" commercial internet.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 378 | **Comments:** 359 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The article is a joint statement from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It expresses grave concern over recent statements and actions by the United States regarding Greenland, reaffirming the inviolability of national sovereignty and the principles of international law. The statement emphasizes the importance of transatlantic cooperation and the rule of law, implicitly criticizing the U.S. administration's aggressive posture toward a European ally.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of the U.S. administration's threats toward Greenland, viewing the statement as a necessary but insufficient response to a dangerous escalation. Commenters express a mix of shame, resignation, and anger as American citizens, with many apologizing to European allies for the actions of their government. The conversation highlights a deep concern that the U.S. is undermining long-standing alliances and normalizing authoritarian behavior, with frequent comparisons made to Putin's Russia.

Key themes include the perceived fragility of the transatlantic relationship, with several users noting that trust has been permanently damaged regardless of the outcome. There is significant debate about the effectiveness of the EU's diplomatic response, with some dismissing it as bureaucratic weakness while others argue it is a calculated strategy to call the U.S.'s bluff. The discussion also touches on domestic U.S. politics, with users suggesting the threats are a distraction from other controversies (such as the Epstein files) and expressing disbelief that any patriotic citizen could support such actions. Historical parallels are drawn to the fall of empires through internal hubris rather than external enemies, framing the current situation as a self-inflicted crisis.

## [Erdos 281 solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro](https://twitter.com/neelsomani/status/2012695714187325745)
**Score:** 272 | **Comments:** 253 | **ID:** 46664631

> **Article:** A tweet claims that "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro" solved Erdos Problem 281, an open question in number theory regarding the covering density of congruences. The post links to a Twitter thread, which in turn links to a discussion on erdosproblems.com. The claim gained significant attention due to the involvement of renowned mathematician Terence Tao, who initially reviewed the solution and praised the LLM's ability to avoid common logical pitfalls, calling it an "unambiguous instance" of AI contribution to the wiki. However, subsequent investigation revealed that the result was actually implicit in a 1936 paper by Davenport and Erdos himself, prompting a reclassification of the problem.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the validity of the AI's mathematical breakthrough and its broader implications for intelligence and labor. The conversation evolved through several key phases:

**Verification and Correction**
Initial skepticism was quickly tempered by the endorsement of Terence Tao, who initially gave the solution a "thumbs up" and praised the LLM for avoiding subtle logical errors common in previous models. However, the community soon uncovered that the solution was not novel; it was actually derived from a 1936 paper by Davenport and Erdos. While the LLM's proof method was noted as different, the problem was downgraded from a new "Section 1" result to a known theorem, highlighting the difficulty of verifying originality even for top experts.

**Nature of Erdos Problems**
Users debated why the AI community focuses on Erdos problems. The consensus was that these problems offer a "sweet spot": they are challenging enough to be prestigious but often consist of "low-hanging fruit"—under-explored questions that human mathematicians haven't prioritized. Tao’s own wiki notes that many Erdos problems are suitable for AI precisely because they require less expert context to attack.

**AI Capabilities and Intelligence**
Beyond the specific math problem, the discussion pivoted to the nature of AI intelligence. Commenters noted that while LLMs lack human common sense, they possess a distinct form of intelligence based on high-dimensional pattern matching. Some argued this is essentially what IQ tests measure. The debate extended to coding, with veteran engineers split between those who believe AI will surpass humans in logic-based work and those who argue that software engineering requires a "common sense" context that AI currently lacks.

**Comparative Performance**
A user tested the same prompt on Deepseek, which produced a proof faster and in a format that was more comprehensible to non-experts than the GPT output. This sparked a side discussion on whether the LLMs were generating original proofs or merely retrieving and reformatting existing literature.

## [The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 198 | **ID:** 46669404

> **Article:** The article is an official press release from the Nobel Peace Prize organization asserting that the prize and the laureate are "inseparable." It clarifies that the medal and diploma are personal property, not to be sold or transferred, and that the Nobel Foundation retains the right to reclaim them if a laureate attempts to dispose of them. The statement emphasizes that the award is given to an individual for their specific actions and achievements, and the physical symbols of the award cannot be separated from that person or their legacy.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly cynical and satirical, treating the Nobel Peace Prize as a politicized and meaningless institution. The conversation can be broken down into three main themes:

1.  **Mockery of the Press Release:** Commenters largely view the official statement as unnecessary and performative. Many use sarcasm to highlight its perceived futility, suggesting it's aimed at "not-so-sane" people who won't be persuaded or that it's a pointless gesture. The most popular response humorously claims to have received Usain Bolt's gold medal, with other users joining in to "compete" for the title of fastest runner, illustrating a belief that such awards are arbitrary and transferable in spirit, if not in fact.

2.  **Criticism of Donald Trump:** The press release is widely interpreted as a response to Donald Trump's attempts to give his Nobel Peace Prize medal to a European leader. Commenters are highly critical of this behavior, describing the former president as "thin-skinned," "self-absorbed," and acting like a "toddler." There is a strong sentiment that this behavior is embarrassing for his supporters, with some noting that this embarrassment has historically affected polling data. One commenter provides a counter-narrative, suggesting that some supporters view this behavior not as a flaw but as a form of entertainment and a successful challenge to established institutions.

3.  **The Nobel Peace Prize's Tarnished Reputation:** The discussion broadens into a general critique of the prize itself. Many users argue that the Peace Prize is a "joke," distinct from the more merit-based scientific Nobel Prizes, and has been politicized for decades. Examples of controversial past winners like Henry Kissinger and Barack Obama are cited to support this point. The conversation also touches on the broader theme of award ownership, with a user noting that Oscar winners don't fully own their statues, which leads to a brief, humorous discussion about the logistics of returning such an award.

## [Kip: A programming language based on grammatical cases of Turkish](https://github.com/kip-dili/kip)
**Score:** 231 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46661897

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Kip," a new programming language whose syntax is based on the grammatical cases of the Turkish language. The project aims to leverage Turkish's highly structured and standardized case system to create a unique programming syntax. The repository includes language definitions and a link to an online playground for experimenting with the language.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive and curious, with several key themes emerging. Many commenters, particularly those familiar with Turkish, found the concept clever and well-executed, praising the clean definitions. The conversation quickly broadened to a linguistic debate about flexible argument order in programming languages, with several users pointing out that many other highly inflected languages (such as Latin, Russian, Finnish, and Hungarian) possess similar grammatical structures that would also be suitable for this approach.

Technical aspects of the language's implementation were also discussed, including how it handles morphological ambiguity and its similarity to concepts like named arguments. The developer of Kip was active in the comments, sharing a link to the project's online playground and engaging with questions about its design choices and inspirations, such as the Perl module Lingua::Romana::Perligata. Overall, the community received the project as an interesting and thoughtful exploration of non-English programming paradigms.

## [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
**Score:** 229 | **Comments:** 151 | **ID:** 46666085

> **Article:** The article, originally from 2014, presents a case study where the author processes a 3.46GB dataset of chess games. They compare a Hadoop cluster (using the mrjob Python library on Amazon EMR) against a standard command-line tool pipeline (using `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq`). The command-line tools completed the task in 23 seconds, while the Hadoop cluster took 57 minutes, making the command-line approach 235 times faster. The author argues that while Hadoop is essential for datasets that exceed the capacity of a single machine, it introduces significant overhead and is often misapplied to datasets that could be processed more efficiently on a single, powerful machine. The core message is to use the simplest and most direct tool for the job, rather than defaulting to complex distributed systems.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News largely validates the article's premise, with a consensus that for datasets fitting on a single machine, simple, local tools are superior. A key theme is the proper context for distributed systems: Hadoop and similar frameworks are for data that is too large to fit on one machine's disk or memory. Commenters noted that modern single machines are incredibly powerful, with vast RAM and fast SSDs, pushing the threshold for needing a cluster ever higher.

The conversation evolved into a critique of modern data engineering practices. Several commenters lamented the trend of over-engineering, where startups use expensive, complex "Modern Data Stack" tools (like Snowflake, Airflow, dbt) to process small datasets, driven by perceived scalability needs and resume-driven development rather than actual requirements. This was contrasted with the perceived simplicity and efficiency of older tools.

There was also a discussion on the evolution of tooling. While the original article used basic command-line utilities, modern commenters highlighted the rise of high-performance, single-node analytical databases like DuckDB and ClickHouse. These tools are seen as a powerful middle ground, offering the ease of use of a single machine with performance that often surpasses older distributed systems for moderately large datasets.

Finally, the discussion included practical engineering considerations. One thread debated the trade-offs of rewriting scripts (e.g., from Bash/Python to C#) for performance, with another commenter pointing out that the real bottleneck is often I/O, not CPU. The conversation also touched on the historical context of tools like mrjob, acknowledging their past importance while recognizing their current niche status.

## [Light Mode InFFFFFFlation](https://willhbr.net/2025/10/20/light-mode-infffffflation/)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 155 | **ID:** 46662662

> **Article:** The article "Light Mode InFFFFFFlation" argues that light mode UIs have been getting progressively brighter over time, using a chart comparing the hex values of white backgrounds in macOS Finder from 2009 to 2025. The author posits that this trend is driven by the shift from desktop monitors to laptops and mobile devices, which have coarse brightness controls. The logic is that designers now default to the brightest possible white (#FFFFFF), assuming users can simply turn down their screen brightness if needed, whereas previously, with less adjustable desktop monitors, a slightly off-white was more comfortable. The article also speculates that the rise of OLED screens may eventually shift dark mode design, as these displays can achieve true black and much lower brightness levels.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a polarized debate on display brightness and UI themes, centering on several key themes:

**The Root Cause of Brightening UIs**
Commenters largely agreed with the article's premise but offered different explanations. The most popular theory, proposed by qball, is that the shift to laptops and phones with easy brightness controls allows designers to use pure white (#FFFFFF), as users can adjust the screen's intensity. In contrast, older desktop monitors lacked such granular control, necessitating less intense default backgrounds. Others pointed to the decline of skeuomorphism and the "dead space" of mobile-first design as contributing factors.

**The Light vs. Dark Mode Debate**
A significant portion of the discussion was a passionate debate between light and dark mode users.
*   **Light Mode Advocates:** Several users expressed a strong preference for light mode, comparing it to reading a book (which reflects light rather than emitting it). They argued that proper brightness calibration (100-150 nits) and automatic brightness settings make light mode comfortable, and that dark mode can cause eye strain, blur vision, or create "afterimages" (horizontal lines).
*   **Dark Mode Advocates:** Proponents of dark mode argued it is more natural, as black pixels emit no light (especially on OLED screens), reducing photoreceptor stimulation. They often described light mode as "masochism mode" or akin to staring at a flashlight, particularly in low-light environments.

**Nuance and Best Practices**
Beyond the binary choice, several comments focused on design principles. Many users advocated against using pure black (#000000) and pure white (#FFFFFF), suggesting that softer, off-white and dark gray shades (e.g., #f6f6ef, #121821) improve legibility and reduce eye strain. The HN interface itself was praised for its pleasing off-white background. The discussion also touched on the impact of display technology, noting that OLED screens allow for "true black" in dark mode, a significant improvement over backlit LCDs.

**Historical Context**
A few commenters provided historical perspective, noting that "light mode" wasn't a term until dark mode became an option. One user shared an image of a BBC Micro's dark screen, predating the modern GUI era, highlighting that dark interfaces were common in early computing.

## [A free and open-source rootkit for Linux](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1053099/19c2e8180aeb0438/)
**Score:** 116 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46666288

> **Article:** The article discusses Singularity, a free and open-source Linux rootkit. It details how the rootkit operates, specifically utilizing the Ftrace kernel mechanism to hook function calls and maintain persistence. The piece notes that the code is MIT licensed, allowing for free use and modification, and highlights the technical sophistication of the tool, which can automatically re-enable Ftrace if it is disabled at runtime to ensure it remains active.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion revolves around three main themes: the implications of the rootkit's open-source license, practical applications of the techniques described, and the technical feasibility of mitigating such threats.

Several users engaged in a tongue-in-cheek debate regarding the MIT license. One commenter argued that a copyleft license (like GPL) would have forced attackers to distribute source code, adding a copyright violation to their crimes. Others joked that criminals likely wouldn't care about licensing laws regardless.

A separate thread focused on the technical aspects of kernel module development. One user expressed interest in using the rootkit's code as a guide for a legitimate project: dynamically remapping file paths to force specific TLS certificates onto "badly behaved" apps. Other commenters suggested safer, standard alternatives like using mount namespaces, `chroot`, or `LD_PRELOAD` to achieve the same result without modifying kernel internals.

Finally, the community debated the danger of releasing such tools publicly. While some worried this would empower "imbeciles" and increase cyberattack risks, others countered that open-source Linux rootkits already exist and this specific tool doesn't significantly change the threat landscape. Technical questions were also raised about whether the Ftrace mechanism, which the rootkit relies on, can be permanently disabled at the kernel compile time to prevent such hooks.
