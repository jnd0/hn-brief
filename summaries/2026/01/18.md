## [ASCII characters are not pixels: a deep dive into ASCII rendering](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering)
**Score:** 957 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46657122

> **Article:** The article "ASCII characters are not pixels: a deep dive into ASCII rendering" by Alex Harri provides a technical guide on converting images into ASCII art. The author explains that the core challenge is not simply matching colors, but accounting for the varying visual density and shape of different characters. The article details a step-by-step implementation of a renderer, starting with basic pixel-to-character mapping and progressively improving it. Key techniques discussed include sampling the target image at a higher resolution to match character aspect ratios, using a luminance-weighted distance metric to find the best character match, and applying a power function to the sampled values to artificially boost contrast. The piece concludes with interactive examples demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was overwhelmingly positive, with commenters praising the article's depth, clarity, and excellent interactive visualizations. Several key themes emerged from the conversation:

*   **Algorithmic Trade-offs:** A primary point of discussion was the trade-off between speed and quality. While the article's method is efficient, commenters noted that a brute-force approach—comparing a target image against the complete bitmap of every available character—can yield superior results at a higher computational cost.
*   **Existing Libraries and History:** Users pointed out that this is a well-established problem. They mentioned existing libraries like `aalib` and `libcaca` as historical and functional examples. `chafa` was highlighted as a modern, high-quality library that uses a similar bitmap-based approach and is considered a benchmark for quality.
*   **Extensions and Future Work:** Commenters explored potential enhancements, such as incorporating color (which adds significant complexity), using proportional fonts, and leveraging Unicode characters for more detail. The conversation also touched on the possibility of using algorithms like k-means clustering to dynamically find an optimal character set for a specific image.
*   **Technical Nuances:** A specific point of technical debate arose around the author's use of a power function to increase contrast. One user questioned the intuition behind it, but another user effectively defended the technique by explaining its mathematical effect on values between 0 and 1, which is a common trick in graphics programming.

## [If you put Apple icons in reverse it looks like someone getting good at design](https://mastodon.social/@heliographe_studio/115890819509545391)
**Score:** 426 | **Comments:** 176 | **ID:** 46663338

> **Article:** The post links to a Mastodon image that visually depicts the evolution of Apple's Pages app icon. The image arranges the icons chronologically from left to right, showing a progression from a highly detailed, skeuomorphic design (an inkwell and quill) to the current minimalist, flat design (a pencil and a colored rectangle). The title humorously suggests that this sequence looks like someone "getting good at design," implying that the progression represents an improvement in skill and style.
>
> **Discussion:** The comment section is largely critical of the modern flat design trend, with many users arguing that the evolution depicted in the image represents a loss of clarity and communicative power rather than an improvement.

A central theme is the debate between skeuomorphism and minimalism. Several commenters argue that the older, more illustrative icons were clearer and more intuitive, while modern icons have become overly abstract and "busy" or, conversely, too simplistic to be meaningful. It's noted that the "sweet spot" for icon design likely lies somewhere in the middle of this timeline, balancing illustrative detail with recognizability. One user shares a personal anecdote about designing a large icon set, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing end-user clarity over internal consensus.

There is significant frustration with the current trend of "consistency" in icon design, particularly from major tech companies like Apple and Google. Critics argue that making all icons conform to a similar shape or color scheme (e.g., using a common background shape with a unique symbol on top) makes them harder to distinguish at a glance, defeating a primary purpose of an icon. This is seen as a move toward aesthetics over function.

The discussion also touches on the role of user expectation and learned behavior in icon recognition. One commenter posits that good icons evolve to match user expectations, while others mock overly abstract designs that require prior knowledge or explanation (like the modern pencil icon, which some argue only makes sense in the context of an Apple Pencil). The overall sentiment is a preference for icons that are immediately understandable and distinct, rather than those that adhere to a minimalist design philosophy.

## [The recurring dream of replacing developers](https://www.caimito.net/en/blog/2025/12/07/the-recurring-dream-of-replacing-developers.html)
**Score:** 403 | **Comments:** 316 | **ID:** 46658345

> **Article:** The article, now offline but described by commenters as "AI slop," discusses the recurring historical pattern of claims that new technologies (like spreadsheets or AI) will replace software developers. The central argument is that while these tools increase abstraction and productivity, they don't eliminate the need for human developers. Instead, they shift the focus to higher-level problems and more complex systems. The article concludes that developers should use new tools with clear expectations about their capabilities and the enduring need for human judgment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely sidestepped the unavailable article to debate the broader themes of AI's impact on the software industry. The conversation coalesced around several key points:

*   **The "Who Prompts the AI?" Argument:** A prominent viewpoint is that even if AI writes code, a skilled human is still required to direct it effectively. Commenters argued that this role—translating complex problems into instructions for a computer—is fundamentally what a programmer does, suggesting that AI will change the job rather than eliminate it.
*   **Economic and Market Skepticism:** Many users expressed cynicism about the motivations behind the "AI will replace developers" narrative. They argued it is primarily a marketing tactic driven by market incentives and shareholder value, rather than a reflection of the technology's actual capabilities. This led to discussions about capitalism's inherent drive to reduce labor costs and the resulting tension between businesses and workers.
*   **Historical Parallels and Abstraction:** Several commenters drew parallels to past technological shifts, most notably the rise of spreadsheets. The consensus was that tools like Excel didn't eliminate developers but instead created new roles (like "citizen developers") and increased the overall volume of work, often generating more demand for developers to build and maintain the underlying data systems. This fits into the classic narrative of programming history, where each new layer of abstraction (assembly, high-level languages, frameworks) frees developers to tackle more complex problems rather than replacing them.
*   **The Nature of AI vs. Previous Tools:** A key distinction was made between generative AI and previous abstractions. While past tools were deterministic and verifiable, AI is probabilistic and non-deterministic. This fundamental difference introduces new challenges regarding reliability and trust that previous technological leaps did not.
*   **Psychological and Social Dynamics:** Some commenters delved into the psychological aspect, suggesting that the desire to replace developers stems from an "ancient jocks vs. nerds" dynamic or that developers are often the "messengers" of difficult technical realities that stakeholders wish to ignore.

## [US electricity demand surged in 2025 – solar handled 61% of it](https://electrek.co/2026/01/16/us-electricity-demand-surged-in-2025-solar-handled-61-percent/)
**Score:** 344 | **Comments:** 308 | **ID:** 46656903

> **Article:** The linked article from Electrek reports that US electricity demand increased in 2025 and that solar power was responsible for meeting 61% of this new demand. The article frames this as a significant milestone for renewable energy deployment.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the article, focusing on the accuracy of its headline and the omission of context. The key themes are:

**Criticism of the Article's Headline and Accuracy**
Many commenters argue the headline is misleading. They clarify that solar did not handle 61% of total US electricity demand, but rather 61% of the *surge* in demand, which itself was a modest 3% increase over the previous year. Several users describe the title as "blatantly false" or "lying," expressing frustration that the publication prioritizes a positive narrative over factual precision.

**Analysis of the Demand Surge**
While the article focuses on solar's contribution, commenters speculate on the cause of the increased demand. The primary theory is the massive energy consumption of new data centers, particularly those powering Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Technical and Economic Feasibility of Solar**
A separate thread discusses the practical realities of solar adoption:
*   **Scalability and Grid Integration:** While solar is praised for its rapid, decentralized deployment, others point out that as its share of the grid grows, it requires significant technical coordination and political will to maintain grid stability.
*   **Personal Installation:** Several users share that rooftop solar is not economically viable for them due to high installation costs, local weather conditions, and unfavorable utility buyback programs. A comparison is made to countries like the Netherlands and Australia, where permitting and installation are reportedly much simpler and cheaper.
*   **Land Use:** A counterpoint is raised about the use of productive farmland for large-scale solar farms. Some suggest a better approach would be to mandate solar panels on new buildings and parking lots, or to focus on unproductive land, while others note the potential of agrivoltaics (combining solar and agriculture).

**Broader Concepts**
The discussion also touches on Jevons paradox, with users noting that increased energy efficiency and availability (from solar) can lead to an overall increase in consumption, partially explaining the demand surge.

**Score:** 252 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46656834

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for "Map To Poster," an open-source Python tool that generates artistic, stylized map posters of cities. The tool uses OpenStreetMap data to create visually appealing road network art, which can be customized with different themes (e.g., "sunset") and distances. It outputs images in PNG format by default, though the code can be tweaked to produce SVG or PDF files.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was largely positive, with users praising the tool's aesthetic output and the quality of the project's README. Several users engaged in technical troubleshooting and feature requests. Key topics included:

*   **Rendering and Output Formats:** A user suggested adding SVG export capabilities, which the author confirmed is possible with a minor code change. However, another user noted that exporting to vector formats for large cities can be extremely slow.
*   **Map Data and Configuration:** Users asked about specific map anomalies, such as missing areas in San Francisco (identified as public park land) and a distorted map of Venice. The author explained that Venice's distortion resulted from not adjusting the distance parameters to account for the city's unique shape.
*   **Performance and Usability:** One user reported the data download getting stuck at 0%, which was clarified as a progress bar display issue where the bar only updates after a step is fully complete. The author advised using a smaller distance parameter for faster results during testing.
*   **Alternatives and Inspiration:** Users shared similar tools, including Prettymapp and City Roads. Another user shared a creative application of the concept: using map prints as jigsaw puzzles to learn city layouts, sparking a discussion on the navigational complexity of cities like Sydney.

## [PCs refuse to shut down after Microsoft patch](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/16/patch_tuesday_secure_launch_bug_no_shutdown/)
**Score:** 244 | **Comments:** 266 | **ID:** 46656998

> **Article:** A recent Microsoft patch (KB5060842) for Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2 is causing some PCs to hang during the shutdown process, leaving systems in an unresponsive state. The issue is linked to the "Secure Launch" virtualization-based security feature. While Microsoft's official health dashboard initially indicated the bug only affected Enterprise and IoT editions, the article notes that the KB article itself claims it impacts "all editions." Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and provided a temporary workaround: using the command prompt command "shutdown /s /t 0" to force an immediate shutdown.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely moved past the technical specifics of the bug to focus on broader frustrations with Microsoft's software quality and the Windows ecosystem. A central theme was the perceived decline in reliability, with users joking that Windows has become "vibe-coded" and criticizing Microsoft for prioritizing features like Copilot over fundamental quality assurance. Many commenters expressed a sense of resignation, arguing that neither end-users nor companies have viable alternatives due to deep-seated workflow dependencies on Microsoft Office and the high cost of switching operating systems.

The conversation also touched on the real-world consequences of such bugs, with users sharing anecdotes of laptops overheating and being damaged when they failed to suspend or shut down properly. There was some meta-discussion about the source article (from *The Register*) and the nature of HN comments, but the prevailing sentiment was one of cynicism toward Microsoft's update process and a belief that such quality control failures are becoming increasingly common.

## [Raising money fucked me up](https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/blog/raising-money-fucked-me-up)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46660543

> **Article:** The author, Yakko Majuri, describes the profound negative psychological impact of raising venture capital for his startup. He argues that the pressure from investors, combined with the weight of the capital itself, fundamentally changed his behavior for the worse. Instead of fostering creativity and growth, the funding induced a state of intense anxiety, paranoia, and a compulsion to appear constantly busy and successful. This led him to make counterproductive decisions, prioritizing the appearance of progress over genuine, sustainable growth. The article is a raw confession of how the external validation of fundraising can corrupt a founder's internal compass and mental health.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's experience, treating it as a common and understandable founder's plight. A central theme is the reframing of the situation through a probabilistic lens, with several commenters suggesting that viewing startups and investments as "bets" (akin to poker) can help detach self-worth from outcomes and mitigate anxiety. However, others countered that real-life variables are far less knowable than in a game of poker.

Commenters explored the psychological roots of this pressure, linking it to internalized expectations, the desire for validation, and the "second-system syndrome" where a founder's second venture is burdened by the weight of past experience. The discussion also contrasted the anxieties of VC-backed startups (intense, high-stakes pressure) with those of bootstrapping (a slow burn of uncertainty and self-doubt), concluding that neither path is inherently less stressful and self-awareness is key to choosing the right fit.

Overall, the community's reaction was supportive and empathetic. The author's vulnerability was seen as a sign of strength and self-awareness, with many sharing their own experiences with loneliness, paranoia, and anxiety. Practical advice centered on seeking external support, such as therapists, mentors, or a "chief of staff" of advisors, to process these pressures and maintain perspective.

## [After 25 years, Wikipedia has proved that news doesn't need to look like news](https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/01/after-25-years-wikipedia-has-proved-that-news-doesnt-need-to-look-like-news/)
**Score:** 195 | **Comments:** 220 | **ID:** 46656911

> **Article:** The article argues that Wikipedia, after 25 years, has fundamentally changed how we consume information, proving that "news" doesn't need to follow traditional journalistic formats. Instead of breaking news stories, Wikipedia provides a constantly updated, collaborative, and reference-based summary of events. It highlights tools like "Weeklypedia" that aggregate these changes, showing how the platform effectively curates and synthesizes information over time, offering a durable alternative to the ephemeral nature of mainstream news cycles.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the reliability, bias, and utility of Wikipedia as a source of information. A significant portion of the debate focuses on whether Wikipedia is inherently biased or more reliable than traditional news outlets. Some users argue that Wikipedia is easily manipulated by agendas and "high bidders," citing recent controversies and specific examples of bias, particularly regarding political and medical topics. Others counter that it is generally more reliable than partisan news sources like Fox News, with a community that quickly corrects errors.

There is also a conversation about the nature of "truth" and information consumption. One commenter suggests that having multiple biased news sources is healthier than relying on a single, ostensibly unbiased source like the BBC, as it forces individuals to engage in critical thinking. Another user reflects on the danger of centralized "truth," noting that the internet has made information easier to tamper with compared to the slower, more fragmented "fuzzy reality" of the past.

Finally, the practical utility of Wikipedia is debated. While some users praise it as an excellent summary tool for ongoing events and for comparing cross-cultural perspectives, others criticize it as a poor learning resource, particularly for complex subjects like mathematics. Several commenters expressed a preference for subject-matter experts or traditional books for in-depth learning, viewing Wikipedia only as a starting point for simple facts.

## [Light Mode InFFFFFFlation](https://willhbr.net/2025/10/20/light-mode-infffffflation/)
**Score:** 189 | **Comments:** 137 | **ID:** 46662662

> **Article:** The article "Light Mode InFFFFFFlation" argues that light mode user interfaces have been getting progressively brighter over the years. The author demonstrates this by comparing screenshots of the macOS Finder and Safari from 2009 to 2025, showing a clear trend from off-white and gray backgrounds to pure white (#FFFFFF). The piece suggests this shift is a form of "inflation," where the baseline for "white" has crept upwards, potentially leading to increased eye strain and a loss of subtle design cues. The author advocates for a return to more restrained, off-white backgrounds in light mode designs.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on the causes of this trend, the fundamental debate between light and dark modes, and the role of hardware evolution.

A primary theme was identifying the root cause of brighter interfaces. Several users pointed to the shift from desktops to laptops and mobile devices as a key driver. The argument is that since laptops and phones have coarse, easily accessible brightness controls, designers can push whites to be as bright as possible, assuming users will adjust the screen brightness down if needed. In contrast, desktop monitors historically lacked such simple controls. Others suggested the trend away from skeuomorphism towards flat design also contributed, as did the increase in "dead space" in mobile-first UIs.

The conversation also delved into the light mode versus dark mode debate, revealing strong personal preferences. Many users expressed a clear preference for dark mode, citing reduced eye strain, especially in low-light conditions. However, a significant contingent defended light mode, arguing it's more natural for daytime use, can reduce eye strain by constricting pupils, and is superior for dealing with reflections on glossy screens. Some users noted that their preference is context-dependent, switching between light and dark modes based on the time of day.

Finally, the discussion touched on the impact of hardware technology. The rise of OLED screens was mentioned as a factor making dark mode more effective, as true black pixels emit no light, offering infinite contrast and saving battery. Conversely, users with LCD screens noted that "dark mode" is often just a dark gray due to backlight bleed. The role of automatic brightness was also debated, with some finding it helpful while others criticized its inconsistency, especially in varied home environments.

> **Article:** The article from The Economist reports that 2025 was the third hottest year on record, following 2023 and 2024. It notes that the last 11 years have been the hottest 11-year period in recorded history, underscoring the accelerating trend of global warming. The piece likely discusses the scientific data behind these findings and the implications of continued temperature increases.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of resignation, debate over solutions, and geopolitical analysis regarding climate change. Key themes include:

*   **Pessimism and Resignation:** Many commenters express a sense of inevitability and futility. Some believe humanity has already passed critical tipping points and is incapable of coordinated global action, citing human nature and economic incentives that favor cheap fossil fuels. There's a recurring sentiment that proposed solutions are insufficient or scams, and that adaptation may be the only realistic path forward.

*   **Debate on Solutions and Progress:** A significant point of contention is the effectiveness of current efforts. While some argue that structural change is lacking and political will is weak, others point to substantial progress, particularly in China's massive deployment of renewables and nuclear energy, as well as advancements in Europe. The hope is that green technology will eventually outcompete fossil fuels on price alone, making transition inevitable.

*   **Geopolitics and Responsibility:** Commenters clash over the roles of different nations. Some highlight China's status as the largest emitter and its rapid increase in emissions, questioning the narrative of it "charging ahead" in a positive way. Others note that the US has reduced emissions but remains a major producer, and that telling developing nations to forgo growth is a losing strategy. The discussion touches on the difficulty of balancing economic development with emission reductions.

*   **Criticism of Reporting and Goals:** There is skepticism towards the media's framing, with some criticizing the use of "on record" (implying a limited timeframe) and the vagueness of long-term targets like "carbon neutral by 2050." The focus is shifted towards tangible temperature goals and avoiding tipping points, rather than distant deadlines.

*   **Data and Evidence:** Despite the pessimism, there is a consensus on the availability of raw climate data, with one commenter directing others to the Copernicus Climate Data Store. The overwhelming evidence of warming is not in dispute among the participants; the debate centers on the appropriate response and the feasibility of meaningful change.

**Score:** 181 | **Comments:** 241 | **ID:** 46659651

> **Article:** The article reports that the US is threatening to impose a 10% tariff on eight European countries, including the UK and several EU nations, in retaliation for their opposition to US control of Greenland. This move is framed as a response to the countries' rejection of the US administration's desires regarding the territory. The report highlights the escalating trade tensions and the specific geopolitical focus on Greenland, which has been a subject of controversial statements by US leadership.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly critical of the US administration, with commenters viewing the tariff threat as an aggressive and irrational act that undermines international alliances like NATO. Many express dismay at the transformation of the US from a reliable ally to a hostile actor, with some attributing this shift to specific political figures and media influence.

Key themes include:
*   **Criticism of US Leadership:** Commenters frequently blame the Trump administration for the geopolitical tension, using terms like "madness," "fascist," and referencing the "king rule" to describe the perceived authoritarian shift. There is a strong sentiment that the administration is acting out of personal whim rather than national interest.
*   **Geopolitical Strategy and Alliances:** The threat to NATO is a major concern, with users questioning the alliance's viability under current US policies. The discussion also touches on the strategic absurdity of the tariff's application, noting that EU companies could easily circumvent them by routing goods through non-targeted member states.
*   **European Response:** There is a debate on how the EU should react. Some commenters advocate for a strong retaliatory stance, suggesting the implementation of a Digital Services Tax (DST) as a countermeasure. Others are pessimistic, believing the EU will ultimately yield to US pressure.
*   **Underlying Motivations:** Speculation runs rampant regarding the true reasons for the aggressive foreign policy. Several comments link the actions to a desire to distract from other controversies, specifically the unreleased Epstein files, suggesting a need to create chaos to bury damaging personal information.
*   **Historical Context:** Some users frame the current events not as a new phenomenon but as a continuation of historical US foreign policy, arguing that the US has always acted opportunistically. Others see it as a unique and dangerous departure from post-WWII norms.

## [Kip: A programming language based on grammatical cases of Turkish](https://github.com/kip-dili/kip)
**Score:** 169 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46661897

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Kip," a new programming language designed around the grammatical cases of Turkish. The language leverages Turkish's case system (e.g., nominative, accusative, dative) to allow for highly flexible argument ordering in function calls. The developer, "joomy," explains that the language uses morphological analysis to infer the role of arguments based on their case suffixes, and a type checker resolves any ambiguities. A browser-based playground for the language is also available for experimentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was largely positive and curious, with several distinct themes emerging. Many commenters, particularly those familiar with Turkish or other highly inflected languages, expressed delight at the concept, noting that Turkish's standardized case system makes it a strong candidate for such a linguistic approach to programming.

A key point of debate was a claim that Turkish is uniquely suited for flexible argument order. Several users pushed back, arguing that this is a common feature of many inflected languages, including Slavic languages (like Russian), Latin, Sanskrit, Finnish, and Hungarian. They provided examples of flexible word order in both English and Latin to illustrate that the phenomenon is not exclusive to Turkish.

Technical discussion centered on how Kip handles ambiguity. The developer explained that the language uses a morphological analyzer (TRmorph) and a type checker to resolve ambiguities that arise from suffixes, a method they contrasted with other approaches that might use apostrophes. Other developers shared their own related projects, such as "sembolik-fikir," and drew parallels to other non-English programming languages like "Lingua::Romana::Perligata" (Latin) and "Tampio" (Finnish).

Finally, several users expressed enthusiasm for the novelty of the language, with one calling it "cleverly clean" and another joking that it would be a language "an LLM can choke on." A request was made for side-by-side code comparisons with a more conventional language to better understand its practical differences from record types, to which the developer responded that the key distinction is the automatic inference of argument roles via case.

## [Erdos 281 solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro](https://twitter.com/neelsomani/status/2012695714187325745)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46664631

> **Article:** A Twitter user claimed that a hypothetical "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro" solved Erdos Problem #281, a mathematical conjecture. The post links to a discussion on the erdosproblems.com forum where the AI's proof was analyzed. The core claim is that an LLM generated a valid mathematical proof for an open problem, a significant milestone in AI's capability for formal reasoning.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the verification of the AI's claim, the implications for mathematics, and the broader impact on technical professions. Initially, commenters expressed skepticism, noting that LLMs often generate plausible but incorrect proofs. However, the conversation shifted dramatically when it was revealed that Terence Tao, a preeminent mathematician, had reviewed the proof on the erdosproblems forum and given it a "thumbs up," calling it an "unambiguous instance" of AI contribution.

The discussion then evolved into several key themes:

*   **Verification and Correction:** While Tao's endorsement was seen as a strong validation, a subsequent comment pointed out that the problem might have been implicitly solved in a 1936 paper by Davenport and Erdos. This led to the problem being reclassified, though the AI's proof method was still considered novel. Another user demonstrated that a different model, Deepseek, could also solve the problem and provided a more accessible proof.

*   **Impact on Mathematics:** Commenters debated the nature of the solved problem, questioning if it was "low-hanging fruit" that human researchers had overlooked. The consensus, supported by a link to Tao's wiki, was that Erdos problems range from extremely difficult to "low hanging fruit" suitable for AI, and it's hard to distinguish them in advance. The event was seen as a sign that AI will accelerate the pace of mathematical discovery, particularly for minor theorems.

*   **Broader Implications for Technical Work:** The article sparked a parallel debate about AI's role in software engineering. Several experienced developers argued that AI has already surpassed humans in coding ability and that they are shipping software with minimal manual coding. This view was countered by skepticism from others who believe AI still lacks common sense, a crucial component of good software. The debate highlighted a growing divide between those actively using AI to build products and those who remain unconvinced by its current capabilities.

> **Discussion:** The discussion is a nostalgic and largely positive reflection on jQuery's enduring impact, mixed with pragmatic analysis of its modern role. Many users expressed gratitude for the library, crediting it with making web development enjoyable and accessible, and kick-starting their careers. The conversation highlighted several key themes:

*   **Backward Compatibility:** There was a debate on the merits of jQuery 4.0.0 still supporting IE 11. While some saw it as unnecessary bloat, others defended it as a crucial feature for users in constrained environments like school labs or legacy enterprise systems.
*   **Modern Relevance & Size:** Commenters compared jQuery's size (27kB) to modern, leaner alternatives like Preact (4.7kB), questioning its efficiency for new projects. However, it was noted that jQuery's broader feature set and legacy support account for its larger footprint.
*   **Legacy and Nostalgia:** A dominant sentiment was appreciation for jQuery's role in taming the "chaos" of early web development. Many shared personal stories of how it simplified their work, while others noted its current use is often confined to maintaining older sites (like WordPress) or specific, simple tasks.
*   **Future Outlook:** The release prompted humorous and cynical takes on the longevity of modern frameworks, with one user joking that React will still be around in 2060. There was also a brief mention of older, lightweight alternatives like Zepto.js.

## [Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 186 | **ID:** 46661217

> **Article:** The BBC article reports that Canada has finalized a new trade agreement with China, signaling a strategic pivot away from its traditional reliance on the United States. The deal, negotiated under Prime Minister Mark Carney, aims to diversify Canada's trade partnerships in response to recent US tariffs and protectionist policies. The article highlights that this move mirrors a broader global trend of countries forming new alliances independent of US influence, citing the EU-Mercosur trade deal as a parallel example. The agreement is framed as a necessary recalibration for Canada to secure its economic future in a changing geopolitical landscape.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is highly polarized, centering on the decline of US global influence, the motivations behind Canada's pivot, and the risks involved. A dominant theme is the criticism of current US leadership and policies, with many commenters arguing that the US has become an unreliable and untrustworthy partner due to its protectionist tariffs and "casual threats of invasion" against allies like Canada. This sentiment is tied to the idea that the US is actively ceding its power to China, a point underscored by the fact that a "formerly top ally" is now seeking partnerships elsewhere.

Several users analyze the long-term economic implications, with some speculating that the US administration's strategy might be to intentionally devalue the dollar to inflate away its national debt, a high-stakes gamble that could accelerate the end of the dollar's reserve currency status. Others debate the relative dangers of the US versus China, with a notable argument that for Western citizens, the US poses a more immediate threat to privacy and freedom than China, despite China's own authoritarianism.

The conversation also delves into the specifics of the Canadian auto industry. Commenters discuss the potential for a new "Auto Pact" to rebuild Canadian manufacturing with Chinese EV technology, though this is met with skepticism about whether cars built with Canadian union wages could compete with established brands. The historical context of Canada-US relations is brought up, noting that Canada was originally an "anti-American project" and that the current pivot is a return to a more independent posture. The discussion is marked by strong, often emotional language, reflecting deep frustration with US politics and a sense of a pivotal moment in global realignment.

## [Show HN: Streaming gigabyte medical images from S3 without downloading them](https://github.com/PABannier/WSIStreamer)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46656358

> **Project:** The project is WSIStreamer, a tool designed to stream large Whole Slide Images (WSIs) directly from S3 object storage without requiring a full download. It addresses the challenge of viewing massive medical images (often gigabytes in size) by fetching only the necessary tiles on demand. The tool is relevant for environments where WSI files are stored on object storage systems without a traditional filesystem, where standard libraries like OpenSlide cannot operate. It currently supports TIFF and SVS files with JPEG and JPEG2000 compression.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centered on the project's technical parallels, format compatibility, and practical applications. Several users noted the strong similarities between streaming medical images and geospatial data, suggesting that techniques like Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) or map libraries like Leaflet could be adapted for this purpose. However, the creator clarified that a key requirement is supporting proprietary scanner formats (like SVS and NDPI) directly, as these are prevalent in datasets like TCGA and contain essential metadata, making conversion to standard formats like COG undesirable or impractical.

Debate arose regarding image compression and standards. While some argued for lossless formats like PNG and TIFF for medical data, others pointed out that the DICOM WSI standard acknowledges that compression does not necessarily impact diagnostic utility, and that the sheer size of these images (often 500k x 500k pixels) makes compression a practical necessity. Alternative technologies like JPEG-XL and IIIF were mentioned as potential solutions for efficient partial image decoding.

Practical considerations were also raised. Users discussed the tool's applicability in on-premises versus cloud environments, with the creator noting that WSIStreamer is specifically for object storage lacking a filesystem, whereas on-premise file systems can use existing tools like OpenSlide. There was also a minor clarification regarding the term "streaming"—acknowledging that while the full file isn't persisted, tiles are still downloaded and cached locally. Finally, a user suggested that a client-side parser could potentially handle the task entirely in the browser, though the current implementation relies on server-side processing.

## [You have three minutes to escape the perpetual underclass](https://geohot.github.io//blog/jekyll/update/2026/01/17/three-minutes.html)
**Score:** 142 | **Comments:** 231 | **ID:** 46656256

> **Article:** The article, titled "You have three minutes to escape the perpetual underclass," presents a dystopian vision of the future driven by artificial intelligence. The author argues that we are on the cusp of a technological singularity where AI will become vastly more intelligent than humans. This will lead to mass technological unemployment, rendering human labor economically worthless. The author posits that this will create a permanent "underclass" of humans, whose existence will be tolerated but without purpose or power. The central plea of the article is a call to action: people should refuse to work on developing these powerful AI systems. The author frames this as a collective action problem, stating that if anyone continues to participate in building this technology, "we all lose," and the only way to prevent this future is for everyone to stop contributing to it.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the article, with commenters challenging its premise, the author's credibility, and its lack of practical solutions. A central theme is the critique of the author's perceived hypocrisy. Several users point out that the author, George Hotz, has a CV that includes major tech companies like Facebook and Google, which are key players in the AI development he condemns. This leads to accusations that he is a "neofeudal lord" beneficiary telling others to abandon the system after having already succeeded within it.

Economically, the article's premise is heavily debated. One prominent argument refutes the idea of mass unemployment by invoking the "lump of labor fallacy." This viewpoint holds that labor is not a fixed quantity; as technology automates some tasks, it creates new demands and roles, and human labor reconstitutes itself around what remains scarce and valuable. However, other commenters counter that this historical pattern may not hold if AI becomes capable of performing any task a human can, potentially devaluing all human labor simultaneously. They raise concerns about the fate of those who are already marginalized or unable to adapt, suggesting the "reconstitution" of labor doesn't work for everyone.

The practicality of the author's proposed solution—a boycott of AI development—is also questioned. Commenters describe it as a "prisoner's dilemma," where any individual or company that refrains from developing AI will simply be outcompeted by those who do, making a coordinated global stoppage nearly impossible.

Finally, the discussion explores alternative perspectives on the future. Some users argue that the threat is overblown, particularly for skilled manual labor that is difficult to automate. Others focus on different aspects of the problem, such as the military implications of AI-driven robotics or the economic paradox of a society where automation eliminates the consumer base needed to purchase the goods and services it produces. The overall sentiment is that while the concerns about AI's impact are valid, the article's argument is simplistic, economically incoherent, and undermined by the author's own background.

## [An Elizabethan mansion's secrets for staying warm](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260116-an-elizabethan-mansions-secrets-for-staying-warm)
**Score:** 134 | **Comments:** 149 | **ID:** 46659550

> **Article:** The BBC article explores Hardwick Hall, an Elizabethan mansion in Derbyshire, England, to uncover the architectural techniques used to stay warm during the Little Ice Age. The article highlights several key features: the use of large windows to capture solar heat, a thick central stone spine that acts as a thermal mass to store and radiate heat, and the strategic placement of fireplaces in the center of the house rather than on cold exterior walls. These design choices were intentional, aiming to maximize passive solar gain and minimize heat loss, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of seasonal temperature changes long before modern heating technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the article is multifaceted, with commenters debating the relevance of historical building techniques to modern construction, the broader context of European energy efficiency, and specific architectural principles.

A central theme is the applicability of these "Elizabethan secrets" today. Some users, like lm28469, argue that modern building science, such as the Passive House standard, is a direct descendant of these principles and can dramatically reduce heating needs. However, others, like vosper, counter that Passive House design is becoming outdated due to new technologies like solar panels and heat pumps, and that its extreme airtightness can cause issues like overheating and poor air quality without expensive ventilation systems. The debate extends to specific features, with users like crazygringo dismissing the article's lessons as "pure fantasy" for modern architects who already understand solar orientation and thermal mass, while others like IncreasePosts argue that modern "McMansions" often adopt these features as decorative "skeuomorphs" without their functional benefits.

A significant portion of the conversation pivots from heating to cooling. User rappatic points out that Europe's primary residential challenge is now keeping cool in the summer, leading to a high rate of heat-related deaths. This sparks a discussion on how historical passive cooling techniques, like cross-ventilation and awnings, have been lost in favor of air conditioning, even in regions where it's standard. Chao- gives a personal example of how simply opening historically-shuttered windows in an old house provided a significant cooling effect.

Finally, there are practical and regional critiques. Several users, including cwillu and rapsey, criticize the poor insulation standards in many British and Northern European homes, contrasting them with better-insulated houses further south. The practicality of replicating features like a 1.4-meter-thick stone spine in a modern home is questioned, though one user points to the tradition of Russian masonry stoves as a functional alternative. The discussion also touches on the historical context of the Little Ice Age, with a user noting the debate over whether solar activity (the Maunder Minimum) was a primary cause.
