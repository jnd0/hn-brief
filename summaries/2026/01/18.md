## [If you put Apple icons in reverse it looks like someone getting good at design](https://mastodon.social/@heliographe_studio/115890819509545391)
**Score:** 706 | **Comments:** 272 | **ID:** 46663338

> **Article:** The post links to a Mastodon image showing a sequence of Apple Pages icons (or a similar app) evolving from left to right. The visual narrative suggests that as the icons progress from left to right, they become "better at design." The earliest icons are highly detailed and skeuomorphic (e.g., a photorealistic pen and inkwell), while the later icons become increasingly flat, abstract, and minimalist, culminating in a simple geometric shape.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters are sharply divided on the evolution of icon design, generally falling into three camps: those who prefer the clarity of older, illustrative icons; those who defend the modern, minimalist aesthetic; and those who critique the entire trend of uniformity.

A significant portion of the discussion centers on the trade-off between illustration and functionality. Several users argue that the older, skeuomorphic icons were clearer and more intuitive. They contend that while the modern icons may look "clean," they often fail to convey their purpose without prior knowledge or context—citing the inkwell as a specific example of a dated symbol that younger users might not recognize, while also mocking the abstract geometric shapes as equally uninformative. One user noted that the "sweet spot" was likely in the middle of the timeline, where icons retained enough illustrative detail to be recognizable without being overly busy.

Conversely, other users pushed back against the "arrogance" of skeuomorphism fans, arguing that flat design is not just a trend but a result of design theory and practical constraints. They suggested that older icons often looked "dumb" or cluttered, whereas modern icons rely on color and shape association to function within a broader UX ecosystem.

A recurring theme was the frustration with "consistency" in modern design. Several commenters criticized the current trend where app icons are forced into uniform shapes or color palettes (specifically calling out Google and Apple), arguing that this reduces distinctiveness and makes it harder to find apps quickly. One user described the result as "clipart" or "colored blobs." There was also a meta-discussion about the nature of icon design itself, with one user defining a good icon as one that "evokes the concept of the action" rather than literally depicting it, while another lamented the difficulty of designing icons in a collaborative environment where consensus is hard to reach.

## [jQuery 4](https://blog.jquery.com/2026/01/17/jquery-4-0-0/)
**Score:** 552 | **Comments:** 180 | **ID:** 46664755

> **Article:** The article announces the release of jQuery 4.0.0 on the official jQuery blog. While the specific technical details of the release are not provided in the discussion, the announcement signifies a major version update for the long-standing JavaScript library, including the migration to ES modules.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding jQuery 4.0.0 is largely nostalgic and pragmatic, focusing on the library's enduring relevance rather than specific new features. Key themes include:

*   **Backwards Compatibility:** Users appreciate that jQuery 4 continues to support legacy environments like IE 11, acknowledging that many users and institutions (such as schools) are constrained to older hardware and software.
*   **Size vs. Utility:** A debate emerged regarding bundle size, with one user noting that jQuery (27 kB) is significantly larger than Preact (4.7 kB). However, others countered that jQuery provides a broad feature set out-of-the-box, whereas modern frameworks often require additional ecosystem libraries that bloat the final bundle size.
*   **Nostalgia and Career Impact:** Many commenters expressed fondness for jQuery, crediting it with making web development enjoyable and accessible in the early days of the modern web. Several noted that jQuery was foundational to their careers and remains a reliable tool for specific use cases.
*   **Modern Alternatives:** While some users mentioned lighter alternatives like Zepto.js, others discussed "reactive jQuery" patterns to manage legacy codebases. There was a consensus that while React raised the standard for code organization, it can be overkill compared to a well-structured jQuery implementation.
*   **Ecosystem Longevity:** Users joked about the longevity of web technologies, with one comment suggesting that if jQuery is still updated in 2026, React might still be around in 2060.

## [Iconify: Library of Open Source Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)
**Score:** 432 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46665411

> **Article:** The article links to Iconify, a comprehensive library of open-source icons. It functions as a unified interface that aggregates thousands of icons from dozens of popular open-source icon sets (such as Material Design Icons, Font Awesome, and many others) into a single, searchable database. The site allows users to easily browse, search, and copy SVG code or usage snippets for various frameworks, simplifying the process of finding and implementing icons in web projects.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive, with users confirming the utility of Iconify as a convenient, centralized resource for a wide variety of icons. Several commenters shared their personal preferences for specific icon libraries, with Material Icons being a frequent default due to its extensive coverage and neutral style; Phosphor Icons were also mentioned favorably.

The conversation evolved into a technical debate about icon implementation best practices. A key point of contention was how to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). One user argued for inlining SVGs directly into the HTML to avoid layout shifts, while others countered that this approach can bloat the DOM and prevent caching. The consensus leaned towards reserving explicit space for icons (using width/height attributes or CSS aspect ratio) as a more performant and robust solution. Finally, a user shared a project that successfully uses animated icons from the library, demonstrating a creative application of the resource.

## [Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads)
**Score:** 364 | **Comments:** 257 | **ID:** 46668021

> **Article:** The article speculates on how OpenAI might implement an advertising strategy, framing it as a likely necessity for the company's long-term financial sustainability. The author argues that despite OpenAI's current focus on subscription revenue, the immense capital costs of developing and running AI models will eventually force them to explore advertising. The piece analyzes potential ad formats (e.g., sponsored answers, product placements within AI-generated text) and discusses the significant ethical and user-experience challenges this would create. The core thesis is that advertising is an inevitable step for OpenAI to achieve the scale and profitability required by its investors, comparing it to the evolution of other major tech platforms like Google.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely skeptical and critical of the prospect of OpenAI introducing ads. A dominant theme is the "AI bubble," with several users arguing that a pivot to ads would signal that the current hype and valuation are unsustainable. One commenter suggests that even a massive increase in ad revenue wouldn't justify the company's valuation, while another humorously reinterprets AGI as "Ads Generated Income."

User sentiment is overwhelmingly negative towards advertising. Many express a desire to disconnect from ad-driven ecosystems, with one user advocating for building and using locally-run, open-source models as an alternative. There's a strong fear that ads would degrade the user experience and trustworthiness of AI, with one commenter describing it as "contaminating" the internet. The discussion also touches on the business strategy of ads, with a debate on whether premium, paid tiers would also include ads. While some argue this is likely (citing Google's model), others warn of user backlash against being "double-billed."

Finally, a counter-narrative emerges that ads don't necessarily indicate a slowdown in AI progress. One user posits that ads are simply a business necessity to fund the massive hardware costs and prepare for a public offering, not a reflection of technical limitations. Another user dismisses the "job safety" argument, stating that a business would serve ads regardless of whether AGI is achieved.

## [Raising money fucked me up](https://blog.yakkomajuri.com/blog/raising-money-fucked-me-up)
**Score:** 343 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46660543

> **Article:** The author, Yakko Majuri, provides a candid and vulnerable account of the negative psychological impact of raising venture capital for his startup. He argues that the pressure of managing investor expectations fundamentally changed his behavior for the worse. Instead of fostering creativity and long-term thinking, the funding created an intense fear of failure and a need to constantly "prove" his worth. This led to counterproductive habits like overworking, avoiding difficult conversations, and prioritizing optics over genuine progress. The author describes a descent into anxiety and burnout, where the initial validation of securing funding quickly morphed into a heavy burden that distorted his identity and decision-making, ultimately "fucking him up."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the author's experience, treating it as a common and relatable challenge for founders. The consensus is that the article demonstrates valuable self-awareness, which is seen as a critical trait for long-term success.

A prominent theme is the reframing of startup funding and risk through a probabilistic lens, with several commenters drawing parallels to poker. They argue that investors make calculated bets on a portfolio of startups, not a single sure thing, and that founders should adopt a similar mindset. This perspective helps contextualize failure as one of many possible outcomes rather than a personal indictment. However, others countered that real-life probabilities are far murkier than in poker, and systemic factors like privilege can "rig the game."

Commenters also explored the psychological pressures in depth. The anxiety is described as a "self-abuse" driven by a desire for validation and the fear of disappointing others. The pressure can be particularly acute in high-cost-of-living areas where financial runway is a constant concern. The discussion offered various coping mechanisms and perspectives:
*   **External Support:** Many recommended seeking professional help (psychologists, coaches) and building a network of mentors to process these feelings.
*   **Mindset Shift:** A key suggestion was to separate one's identity from the startup's performance and to let go of the fear of others' disappointment, focusing instead on the intrinsic desire to do good work.
*   **Path Dependency:** The conversation extended to the choice between raising capital and bootstrapping. One commenter noted that while VC money introduces investor pressure, bootstrapping brings its own slow-burn anxieties about wasting time on a capital-intensive idea. The "right" path depends on an individual's psychological makeup.
*   **Skepticism:** A lone dissenting voice expressed cynicism about the author's self-analysis, suggesting that people often create rationalizations and misread their own motivations.

Overall, the discussion treated the article not as an anomaly but as an honest depiction of the emotional and psychological toll of entrepreneurship, with the author's vulnerability being widely praised.

## [Statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands,Norway,Sweden,UK](https://www.presidentti.fi/statement-by-denmark-finland-france-germany-the-netherlands-norway-sweden-and-the-united-kingdom-englanniksi/)
**Score:** 293 | **Comments:** 274 | **ID:** 46669025

> **Article:** The article is an official joint statement from the governments of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The statement expresses strong opposition to recent remarks and actions by the United States, specifically referencing President Trump's threats regarding Greenland's sovereignty. The European nations affirm their commitment to defending international law, the sovereignty of nations, and the stability of the Arctic region. They emphasize the importance of the rule of law and the principle that territorial integrity must be respected, implicitly condemning the U.S. administration's aggressive rhetoric as a violation of these norms.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the U.S. administration's posture, with commenters expressing a mix of shame, anger, and geopolitical analysis. The prevailing sentiment is that President Trump's threats against Greenland are dangerous, disgraceful, and a betrayal of long-standing alliances.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Betrayal of Alliance:** Many commenters, particularly those identifying as Americans, express deep shame and apologize for the administration's behavior. They highlight the irony of threatening an ally like Denmark, which has supported the U.S. in military conflicts (e.g., Afghanistan), resulting in loss of life. There is a consensus that this rhetoric is permanently damaging the transatlantic relationship.
*   **Domestic Political Failure:** A significant portion of the debate centers on the inability of the U.S. federal government to check the President's power. Users argue that the system is either too weak or that political polarization (specifically Republican support) prevents any meaningful action. The "Mad King" metaphor is used to describe a leader acting erratically without sufficient institutional guardrails.
*   **Geopolitical Strategy vs. Bluffing:** Users debate whether Trump's threats are a negotiation tactic (demanding the extreme to settle for less) or a genuine imperialistic ambition. While some view it as a bluster that will fail due to economic interdependence (Europe holds significant U.S. debt), others worry that the normalization of such rhetoric erodes global stability. There is also concern that this internal U.S. chaos distracts from real threats in the Arctic from Russia and China.
*   **Criticism of European Response:** While the statement is supported, there is some cynicism regarding the effectiveness of "statements" versus action. However, other users push back against the narrative that the EU is weak, suggesting that Europe has significant economic leverage and will eventually call the U.S.'s bluff.
*   **Historical Parallels:** Several commenters draw historical comparisons, noting that empires often collapse due to internal hubris and poor leadership rather than external enemies. The discussion frames Trump not as a unique anomaly, but as a symptom of a deeper societal or political decline.

## [Erdos 281 solved with ChatGPT 5.2 Pro](https://twitter.com/neelsomani/status/2012695714187325745)
**Score:** 264 | **Comments:** 235 | **ID:** 46664631

> **Article:** The article links to a social media post claiming that a new AI model, "ChatGPT 5.2 Pro," solved Erdos problem #281. The problem asks whether, for any sequence of arithmetic progressions covering the integers, the density of uncovered integers can be made arbitrarily small with a finite number of steps. The post suggests the AI generated a proof for this problem.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion surrounding the AI's purported solution is multifaceted, focusing on verification, the nature of the problem, and the broader implications for AI in mathematics and coding.

A central theme is the verification of the AI's proof. While initial skepticism was high due to LLMs' tendency to generate plausible but incorrect solutions, the conversation shifted after prominent mathematician Terence Tao reviewed the proof. Tao initially gave it a "thumbs up," praising the model's ability to avoid common logical pitfalls and calling it an "unambiguous instance" of an AI solving a Section 1 problem. However, this confidence was tempered by a later comment revealing that the problem's result was actually found in a 1936 paper by Davenport and Erdos himself. This discovery downgraded the problem's novelty, moving it from a new result to a rediscovery of existing literature, though the AI's proof method was noted as being different.

The discussion also delved into the nature of Erdos problems. It was clarified that these problems vary widely in difficulty, from extremely hard to "low-hanging fruit" that are suitable for AI tools. The solved problem #281 was likely in the latter category, representing a problem that human researchers hadn't prioritized rather than a major, long-standing open question.

Broader implications for AI's role in intellectual work were a significant point of debate. Some commenters expressed amazement that the AI demonstrated a form of intelligence, even if not human-like. Others drew parallels to software engineering, with some experienced developers claiming they are already shipping software with minimal manual coding, suggesting a major shift in the field is imminent. However, skepticism remained, with some arguing that AI still lacks the common sense required for complex tasks and that its success in math might be limited to specific, well-defined problems.

Finally, a user demonstrated that another model, Deepseek, could also solve the same problem, producing a proof that some found more comprehensible. This highlighted the growing capability of multiple AI models in this domain and raised questions about whether the models were generating novel proofs or simply retrieving and rephrasing known solutions from their training data.

## [Kip: A programming language based on grammatical cases of Turkish](https://github.com/kip-dili/kip)
**Score:** 222 | **Comments:** 62 | **ID:** 46661897

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Kip," a new programming language whose syntax is based on the grammatical cases of the Turkish language. The project aims to leverage Turkish's morphological richness, particularly its case system, to create a language where function arguments can be provided in any order. The language is implemented in Rust and includes a browser-based playground for experimentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive and linguistically engaged, with several distinct themes emerging.

A central point of conversation was the linguistic premise of the language. While the original poster expressed admiration for Turkish's case system enabling flexible argument order, other users quickly pointed out that this is a feature of many highly inflected languages. Commenters cited examples from Latin, Russian, Slavic languages, Finnish, and Hungarian, demonstrating that case-based syntax is not unique to Turkish.

Many users, including those with some knowledge of Turkish, were pleasantly surprised by the language's design. They had expected a simple keyword translation of an existing language but found the grammatical integration to be "cleverly clean and easy to understand." The project was praised for its thoughtful approach to using natural language features in a programming context.

The developer of Kip, "joomy," was active in the comments, providing a link to an online playground and engaging with technical questions. They explained that Kip uses a sophisticated morphological analyzer (TRmorph) to handle ambiguities in Turkish grammar, which allows it to function without relying heavily on disambiguation marks like apostrophes. The developer also noted inspiration from other non-English programming languages, such as Lingua::Romana::Perligata (Latin) and Tampio (Finnish).

Technical questions focused on how Kip compares to existing concepts. One user asked for side-by-side code comparisons and questioned how the case system differs from record types. The developer clarified that cases function like named arguments, but the names are inferred from the grammatical case of the arguments, allowing for order-agnostic function calls.

Finally, the discussion included a few tangential but related topics, such as a reference to Turkish's "gossip tense" and a humorous comment about the potential difficulty such a language might pose for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## [Light Mode InFFFFFFlation](https://willhbr.net/2025/10/20/light-mode-infffffflation/)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46662662

> **Article:** The article "Light Mode InFFFFFFlation" argues that "light mode" UIs have been getting progressively brighter over the last 15 years. The author demonstrates this by comparing screenshots of macOS and iOS interfaces from 2009/2010 to 2025, showing a clear trend away from grays and bevels toward pure white backgrounds (#FFFFFF). The article posits that this shift is not just aesthetic but also has practical implications for eye strain and display technology, questioning whether the relentless march toward pure white is beneficial for users.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion revolves around the causes of this brightening trend, the physiological effects of light vs. dark modes, and the role of hardware evolution.

**Causes and Trends**
Commenters debated the reasons behind the shift to brighter interfaces. One prominent theory suggests the primary driver is the shift from desktop monitors to laptops and mobile devices. Unlike desktops, portable devices have coarse, easily accessible brightness controls, allowing designers to default to pure white (#FFFFFF) knowing users can simply dim the screen if needed. Others attributed the trend to the death of skeuomorphism and the rise of flat design, noting that early UIs often mimicked physical materials like brushed metal, which were inherently darker. There was also a mention of "Flanderization" or polarization, where design choices become exaggerated over time (light gets lighter, dark gets darker).

**Physiological and Usability Debates**
The comment section was sharply divided on eye comfort:
*   **Light Mode Advocates:** Many users argued that light mode mimics reading physical paper and is superior for daytime use. They claimed that dark mode often causes eye strain, halos, or "laser-like" glare, particularly on LCD screens with backlight bleed. Some noted that constricted pupils in bright environments actually improve depth of field and focus.
*   **Dark Mode Advocates:** Conversely, many users found light mode unbearable, describing it as "masochism mode." They argued that black pixels (on OLED screens) emit no light, which is the natural default state for the eye. They cited issues with light mode causing visual fatigue, especially in low-light environments.
*   **The Middle Ground:** Several users suggested that pure black and pure white are extremes that should be avoided. They advocated for off-white backgrounds (like Hacker News’s beige) and dark grays to reduce contrast and improve legibility without the harshness of pure black/white.

**Hardware Context**
Hardware limitations were cited as a major factor. Users noted that automatic brightness controls are often unreliable, leading to situations where light mode is too bright in dark rooms or too dim in sunlight. The discussion also touched on display technology: OLED screens allow for "true black" (#000000), making dark mode more viable and battery-efficient on mobile devices, whereas LCDs (common on laptops) struggle with backlight bleed, making dark mode appear gray and washed out. A prediction was made that UI design will shift again once OLED becomes the standard for desktop monitors.

## [ThinkNext Design](https://thinknextdesign.com/home.html)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46665310

> **Article:** The article links to "ThinkNext Design," a website that appears to be a portfolio or showcase for a designer named David. The content highlights his work on iconic ThinkPad laptops from the 1990s and early 2000s, including the "swooping" mid-90s AS/400s. The site serves as a retrospective on the design history of these devices.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a broad conversation about the legacy and current state of ThinkPad laptops, with users expressing both strong loyalty and growing frustration with the brand.

A central theme is the enduring appeal of older ThinkPad models. Many users praise their timeless design, legendary durability, and reliability, with one user noting their 8-year-old T480s is still going strong after extensive global travel. This has led to a culture of buying used or refurbished models, referred to affectionately as the "ThinkStack," which are often used as servers or daily drivers. The classic keyboard and non-metallic, rugged chassis are frequently cited as key features that enthusiasts want to preserve, viewing them as functional advantages over modern, sleeker designs.

However, significant criticism is directed at modern Lenovo-era ThinkPads. Users report persistent issues with Linux compatibility, specifically problems with sleep mode that can brick the device or disable Wi-Fi. There are also complaints about declining build quality, with one user noting that plastic cases on models like the T540p can warp over time. Customer service and warranty experiences are described as a "nightmare," leading some to abandon new purchases altogether. Other minor grievances include the "unaesthetic" bright red Lenovo boot logo and the poor performance of a specific "Precision" mouse.

Despite the brand loyalty, some users are exploring alternatives. One commenter mentioned a brief, unsatisfying affair with a MacBook Pro, while another suggested that a 3:2 aspect ratio display is a more important feature than the ThinkPad brand itself. The discussion concludes with a consensus that while the ThinkPad name still carries weight, Lenovo is "riding the brand to destruction" with quality control and support issues, pushing long-time users back to the reliable used market.

## [Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster (2014)](https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html)
**Score:** 190 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46666085

> **Article:** The article, originally from 2014, presents a benchmark comparing the performance of command-line tools (like `awk`, `sort`, and `uniq`) against a Hadoop cluster for processing a 3.46GB dataset of chess games. The author demonstrates that a pipeline of standard Unix tools running on a single machine processed the data in 23 seconds, whereas a Hadoop cluster running a similar MapReduce job took 58 minutes. The author argues that for datasets that can fit on a single machine's disk, the overhead of distributed systems like Hadoop is unnecessary and that simpler, single-machine tools are often more efficient, faster, and easier to debug. The piece serves as a critique of over-engineering and a reminder to choose the right tool for the scale of the problem.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centers on the enduring relevance of the article's core message: avoid the complexity of distributed systems when a single, powerful machine is sufficient. Many commenters agree that the industry has a tendency to over-engineer solutions, citing examples of startups using expensive cloud clusters for small datasets that could be processed locally. This is often attributed to resume-driven development or the perceived "scalability" of modern data stacks (e.g., Airflow, Snowflake) over simpler, "hacky" scripts.

However, the conversation quickly pivots to the article's context. Several users point out that the fundamental premise of Hadoop was to process datasets that are too large to fit on a single machine's disk, a constraint the original benchmark did not test. The debate then shifts to the modern landscape, where single-machine performance has grown exponentially. Commenters highlight that today's hardware (multi-core CPUs, fast SSDs) and modern tools like DuckDB and ClickHouse can process terabytes of data on a single machine, making distributed systems even more niche for many use cases.

There is also a counterpoint that while single-machine tools are powerful, robust, production-grade scripts are difficult to write and maintain, which is a key value proposition of larger frameworks. The discussion concludes with a consensus that the choice of tool should be dictated by the actual data scale, and that the industry often defaults to distributed solutions prematurely.

## [Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko)
**Score:** 171 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46661217

> **Article:** The BBC article reports that Canada is pursuing a new trade agreement with China, signaling a strategic pivot away from its traditional reliance on the United States. This move comes amidst ongoing trade tensions, including US tariffs on Canadian auto imports. The article frames this as Canada seeking to diversify its economic partnerships and reduce its vulnerability to US policy shifts, particularly under the current administration. It highlights the broader context of shifting global alliances and the increasing willingness of US allies to explore independent economic pathways.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the current US administration and largely supportive of Canada's strategic pivot, viewing it as a necessary response to an unreliable and aggressive United States. The dominant theme is the decline of US global influence, with many commenters arguing that "casual threats of invasion" and erratic trade policies are alienating long-standing allies and pushing them toward China. There is a strong sentiment that the US is sacrificing its long-term power for short-term political gains, with one user describing the current strategy as buying into a "depreciating asset."

The conversation also delves into the economic consequences for the US, with speculation that the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency might be used to inflate away US debt, a move that would accelerate the shift away from the dollar and end America's "great tailwind." While some debate the feasibility of this, the consensus is that the US is entering a period of painful economic recalibration.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the comparison between the US and China. While commenters acknowledge China's authoritarianism and surveillance, many argue that the US currently poses a more direct and immediate threat to Western citizens, citing border searches and political rhetoric. The idea that Canada is "negotiating with its emotions" is presented as a counterpoint, suggesting the pivot could backfire by damaging the vital auto industry. However, the prevailing view is that Canada's move is a logical and long-overdue step toward re-establishing a more independent and "vibrant" national identity, separate from US dominance.

## [The Nobel Prize and the Laureate Are Inseparable](https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/press/press-releases/the-nobel-prize-and-the-laureate-are-inseparable)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 88 | **ID:** 46669404

> **Article:** The article is an official press release from the Nobel Peace Prize organization clarifying that the Nobel Prize and the Laureate are inseparable. It states that the physical medal is awarded to the individual and cannot be bought, sold, or transferred. The release notes that while the organization does not facilitate the sale of the medal, it does not object to the sale of the diploma, and it references the history of James Watson selling his medal. The text also details the design of the medal, including the image of Alfred Nobel and the reverse depicting three naked men symbolizing fraternity.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely dismissive and satirical, focusing on the perceived absurdity of the press release and the political context surrounding it. Many commenters view the statement as a direct response to Donald Trump's attempts to claim or display a Nobel Prize, with users mocking his behavior as childish and thin-skinned. There is a consensus that the Nobel Peace Prize has become a politicized and meaningless award, distinct from the scientific Nobels, though some argue that Trump's obsession with it highlights his psychological flaws.

Several users engaged in humorous hypotheticals, joking about receiving their own "gold medals" from famous figures like Usain Bolt or FIFA. Others drew parallels to the Oscars, noting that Academy Award winners don't fully own their statues, which led to a brief discussion about James Watson's sale of his Nobel medal. The overall tone is cynical, with commenters agreeing that the press release was unnecessary for "sane" people but perhaps required for public clarification.

The word appears in Aristophanes' comedy *Assemblywomen* and refers to a dish combining various meats, fish, and sauces.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the technical side effects of posting such a long, unbroken string of characters on Hacker News. Several users noted that the word broke the layout of the mobile site, stretching the page width and forcing horizontal scrolling. Commenters also shared other famous long words, such as "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis" and "antidisestablishmentarianism," and engaged in humorous, flowery dialogue mimicking the style of the post. There was also a brief mention of the potential for the post to break the site's database or display limits, given the word's extreme length.

## [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46666283

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for "Consent-O-Matic," a browser extension designed to automate the dismissal of cookie consent pop-ups. The tool works by identifying common patterns in consent banners and automatically selecting the "Reject All" or "Minimum Necessary" options, rather than the default "Accept All" that many other tools use. The goal is to streamline the user experience while adhering to a privacy-first browsing policy without manual interaction on every site.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the utility, reliability, and privacy implications of cookie management extensions. A primary debate compares Consent-O-Matic to simpler solutions like uBlock Origin's "cookie notices" list or the "I don't care about cookies" extension. While many users value the time-saving aspect of these tools, there is significant concern regarding their default behaviors. Several commenters pointed out that extensions like "I don't care about cookies" often default to accepting all tracking to make banners disappear, which defeats the privacy purpose.

Users also debated the effectiveness of these tools. While some described Consent-O-Matic as an essential "quality of life" improvement, others reported that it frequently breaks website functionality or fails to detect newer, non-standard pop-ups. The conversation expanded to a critique of the "cookie banner" phenomenon itself, with commenters expressing frustration at the "civil disobedience" of websites that implement overly aggressive consent prompts. There was a consensus that many sites deploy these banners unnecessarily (even when not tracking), leading to "consent fatigue" where users blindly click "accept" just to clear the screen, ultimately undermining the intent of privacy regulations like GDPR.

## [Profession by Isaac Asimov (1957)](https://www.abelard.org/asimov.php)
**Score:** 145 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 46664195

> **Article:** The article is a link to Isaac Asimov's 1957 science fiction short story, "Profession." The story is set in a future society where individuals are "tape-trained" (educated via direct brain imprinting) for specific professions from a young age, while those who resist this process or fail to be selected are relegated to menial labor. The protagonist, George, is a "creative" who is secretly being trained to be a "Professional" in a field that requires genuine innovation. The story explores themes of standardized education, the nature of creativity, and the limitations of rote learning versus intuitive understanding. It culminates in a twist where George realizes that true professionals must possess the ability to think beyond the established knowledge base, symbolized by his curiosity about the etymology of the word "Olympics."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the story's enduring relevance, particularly regarding education, creativity, and modern technology. Users praised the narrative for its prescient critique of rigid systems and its compelling ending. A major theme was the story's application to contemporary issues; several commenters drew parallels between the "tape-trained" humans in the story and current Large Language Models (LLMs), arguing that while AI can replicate existing knowledge, it struggles with genuine innovation and deep learning in the same way the story's society does.

The conversation also touched on the story's critique of the "Mozart in the womb" theory, with users debating the validity of early exposure to complex concepts. Additionally, the discussion highlighted the story's commentary on how rigid social or educational structures often rely on outsiders or "creatives" for true progress. While the majority of the thread focused on the literary and philosophical merits of the story, a minor note of caution was raised regarding the source of the link provided in the original post, which contained unrelated controversial content.

## [What is Plan 9?](https://fqa.9front.org/fqa0.html#0.1)
**Score:** 109 | **Comments:** 29 | **ID:** 46667675

> **Article:** The linked article is the "Frequently Questioned Answers" (FQA) for Plan 9, a distributed operating system developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a successor to Unix. The FQA serves as a FAQ, explaining Plan 9's core design philosophy, which centers on treating system resources as files in a unified hierarchical namespace. It addresses common questions about the OS's architecture, its "everything is a file" approach, and its purpose as a research system for exploring new ideas in operating system design.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community with a strong appreciation for Plan 9's philosophy, though it also touches on its practical limitations and modern relevance.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on Plan 9's influence on modern systems. Commenters highlight its legacy in Linux, specifically the v9fs subsystem for distributed filesystems, which is praised for being more "network native" than FUSE. The discussion also touches on the relationship between Plan 9 and other systems like Inferno, with one user noting that Go can be seen as a spiritual successor to Inferno's Limbo language.

The debate over programming languages and simplicity was a key theme. While one user expressed a desire for a Rust implementation, others argued that Plan 9's custom C dialect is a "nice clean language" that fits the system's ethos. A commenter contrasted this simplicity with the complexity of modern languages like Swift and C++, describing Plan 9 as a "therapy" that is enjoyable to work with.

Finally, the discussion covered the current state of the Plan 9 ecosystem. Users confirmed that the project is still active, pointing to the daily commits of the 9front fork and an upcoming Plan 9 conference. Practical topics included the availability of a retina-capable drawterm for macOS and the status of ports to modern hardware like RISC-V. A philosophical debate emerged about the "everything is a file" abstraction, with one user questioning its relevance in a world of web APIs and SQL databases, while another countered that this very abstraction is what enables avoiding such technologies.

## [U.S. Court Order Against Anna's Archive Spells More Trouble for the Site](https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-court-order-against-annas-archive-spells-more-trouble-for-the-site/)
**Score:** 108 | **Comments:** 45 | **ID:** 46664646

> **Article:** A U.S. court has issued a default judgment against Anna's Archive, a prominent shadow library, in a lawsuit filed by OCLC (Online Computer Library Center). The court order prohibits the site and its affiliates from scraping, storing, or distributing data from WorldCat, OCLC's massive library catalog database. The ruling stems from a case where OCLC alleged that Anna's Archive caused significant server strain by scraping data. As Anna's Archive did not mount a legal defense, the court ruled in OCLC's favor, validating a "browsewrap agreement" (terms of service accepted by use) despite a lack of direct evidence that the site's operators had seen them.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a community largely critical of the court's decision and sympathetic to Anna's Archive. The conversation centers on several key themes:

*   **Criticism of OCLC and the Legal System:** Many commenters view the lawsuit as a misuse of legal resources by a legacy organization. They argue that OCLC, a non-profit focused on libraries, is acting against the mission of knowledge distribution. There is significant skepticism about the court's validation of a "browsewrap agreement" without proof of awareness, with some fearing it could set a dangerous precedent for other data-scraping entities, like AI companies.

*   **Enforcement and Jurisdictional Challenges:** Users express doubt that the ruling will be effective. They point out that Anna's Archive operates from jurisdictions that do not enforce U.S. copyright laws, making server takedowns difficult. This leads to a broader discussion on the waning influence of U.S. law and intellectual property norms on the global internet.

*   **The Nature of Anna's Archive:** While the main article focuses on the legal battle, a side thread discusses the site's donation system. One user found it convoluted and subscription-like, but others defended it, clarifying that the "memberships" are one-time donations and that a simple Monero address is available for direct contributions.

*   **Broader Geopolitical and Philosophical Points:** Some commenters connected the case to wider geopolitical shifts, suggesting that the decline of U.S. hegemony could lead to a more open global information environment. Others discussed the value of open data for training large language models (LLMs) and proposed alternative distribution methods, such as physical hard drives, to ensure long-term preservation and access.

## [Computer Systems Security 6.566 / Spring 2024](https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2024/)
**Score:** 108 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46663507

> **Article:** The article links to the website for MIT's Computer Systems Security course (6.858) for Spring 2024. The course covers fundamental security topics including memory safety, web security, cryptography, and hardware side channels, serving as an introductory overview to the field.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the course content, the state of online education, and the realities of working in cybersecurity. A top comment from tptacek notes that while the course provides a broad introduction, many of its individual topics (like memory safety or messaging security) are deep enough to be entire specializations on their own. Another user adds that a single undergraduate semester can only provide a shallow overview compared to years of professional experience.

Several comments reminisce about the early days of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), with one user lamenting that the accessible "ladder" of free, high-quality courses (like Martin Odersky's Functional Programming course) has been largely replaced by monetized platforms, though others note that many of these courses are still available as YouTube playlists.

A technical observation was made about a broken link on the MIT CSAIL site that redirects to a Russian gambling domain, attributed to an expired domain being snatched up. Finally, a cynical comment about the difficulties of working in security—citing resistance from other departments and job insecurity—sparked a debate about the challenges of being a cost center versus moving to the "dark side" (offensive security), which is becoming increasingly competitive.

## [No knives, only cook knives](https://kellykozakandjoshdonald.substack.com/p/no-knives-only-cook-knives)
**Score:** 105 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46663268

> **Article:** The article "No knives, only cook knives" is a personal narrative about the author's experience with a niche hobby: collecting and trading knives, specifically focusing on the culture of flea markets. The author contrasts the thrill of finding unique, high-quality, or vintage knives in person with the impersonal nature of online marketplaces. The piece touches on the specific appeal of certain knife brands and styles, the value of hands-on inspection, and the community aspect of these specialized markets. It concludes with a pointed critique of mass-produced, low-cost knives like those from IKEA, suggesting they lack the character and quality of the knives found through more dedicated collecting channels.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around practical advice for kitchen knives and sharpening, with a secondary thread on the nature of hobbyist markets and a notable defense of IKEA knives.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on what constitutes a practical and effective kitchen knife setup. Several users recommend a minimalist approach, typically consisting of a chef's knife, a paring knife, and a serrated bread knife, echoing advice from America's Test Kitchen. The importance of maintenance, particularly sharpening with a whetstone and proper honing, was emphasized as more critical than the initial cost or brand of the knife. Users shared tips on acquiring affordable sharpening stones, with one noting the difficulty of finding simple, non-gimmicked whetstones in mainstream retail stores.

A strong counterpoint to the article's dismissal of IKEA knives emerged, with multiple users sharing long-term positive experiences with specific models like the Slitbar. They argued that with proper care (honing and occasional sharpening), these affordable knives perform exceptionally well and can outlast more expensive brands, challenging the notion that low cost equates to low quality.

The discussion also touched on the broader theme of niche hobbies. One commenter connected the article's description of a specialized flea market to a successful Bay Area knife store, Bernal Cutlery, while another provided a local's perspective on the San Francisco flea market scene. The conversation briefly veered into a playful comparison of French versus Japanese knives, with a consensus that Japanese knives are superior in metallurgy and design, though one user humorously claimed to use "original Damascus steel" for lost recipes. Overall, the comments balanced practical, everyday advice with the appreciation for the hobbyist culture presented in the article.
