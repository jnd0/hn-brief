## [Apple is fighting for TSMC capacity as Nvidia takes center stage](https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc)
**Score:** 607 | **Comments:** 366 | **ID:** 46633488

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is in a fierce competition with Nvidia for advanced chip manufacturing capacity at TSMC. Historically, Apple has been TSMC's "anchor tenant," securing priority access to the latest nodes for its iPhones and other devices. However, the massive capital expenditure boom in AI has made Nvidia TSMC's largest and most urgent customer for cutting-edge chips like the H100. The article frames this as a shift in leverage, where Apple, once the undisputed king of TSMC's roadmap, now has to compete for capacity with a company that is buying up production at an unprecedented rate. This dynamic is forcing Apple to reconsider its supply chain strategy and explore alternatives like Intel Foundry to diversify its manufacturing base and reduce reliance on TSMC.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News centered on several key themes. A primary debate was whether this situation constitutes "karma" for Apple, which has long been known for its dominant position at TSMC. Some commenters saw it as poetic justice, while others argued it's simply a matter of business, with TSMC making decisions based on capacity and pricing, not favoritism.

Many users analyzed the strategic dynamics at play. One perspective highlighted the difference between Apple, a "stable anchor tenant" providing predictable, long-term cash flow through its mature product cycles, and Nvidia, a "high-frequency trader" hammering the newest nodes for the volatile but massive AI boom. The question was raised whether foundries would risk alienating a reliable giant like Apple for a boom that might not last. However, others noted that in the short term, the highest bidder wins, and Nvidia's current spending power gives it immense leverage.

The discussion also touched on the broader implications for Apple's strategy. Some saw this as a validation of Apple's recent efforts to diversify its manufacturing partners, particularly its interest in Intel as a future foundry. This led to a counterpoint that Apple was a crucial early customer that helped TSMC become the leader it is today, and it has the resources to foster a viable alternative again.

Finally, a significant portion of the conversation veered towards the geopolitical risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, with users debating the likelihood and the United States' ability to respond. A smaller but notable thread criticized the article's "dramatized" and "novel-like" writing style, arguing that it injects unnecessary personal conflict and schadenfreude into what is a standard business negotiation.

## [The Palantir app helping ICE raids in Minneapolis](https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)
**Score:** 589 | **Comments:** 764 | **ID:** 46633378

> **Article:** The article from 404 Media reports on Palantir's "Foundry" app being used by ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to coordinate raids in Minneapolis. The software aggregates data from various government databases to identify neighborhoods and specific targets for enforcement operations. The piece highlights the technological enablement of current immigration policies and the physical impact on communities, citing specific incidents of aggressive tactics employed during these raids.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article is highly critical and politically charged, focusing on the broader implications of the technology and the moral culpability of those involved.

A dominant theme is the fear that tools developed for immigration enforcement will inevitably be turned against the general population. Commenters drew parallels to historical authoritarian regimes like the Stasi and Gestapo, warning that the infrastructure being built today threatens everyone's civil liberties, not just immigrants. Several users referenced the "First they came..." poem to emphasize this point, while others noted the irony of criticizing surveillance in China while similar technologies are deployed domestically.

The conversation also focused heavily on the role of Silicon Valley and Palantir specifically. The company's name, derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's *Lord of the Rings* (where seeing stones are corrupting and dangerous), was frequently cited as a deliberate signal of its intent. Commenters expressed disdain for the engineers and leadership enabling these systems, arguing that financial incentives and a lack of moral courage are driving the development of authoritarian tools. The CEO's political alignment and the company's history of government contracts were discussed as evidence of a consistent pattern of enabling state violence.

Finally, the discussion touched on the physical reality of the raids and the perceived passivity of the American public. Commenters shared reports of ICE agents using violent tactics against citizens and legal observers, sparking debates about why such actions aren't resulting in larger-scale civil unrest or riots compared to other countries. There was a sense of frustration and disbelief regarding the lack of widespread resistance to what many described as a transition toward overt authoritarianism.

## [Photos capture the breathtaking scale of China's wind and solar buildout](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/china-renewable-photo-essay)
**Score:** 552 | **Comments:** 427 | **ID:** 46630369

> **Article:** The article from Yale Environment 360 is a photo essay showcasing the immense scale of China's renewable energy buildout. Through a series of striking photographs, it documents the vastness of China's wind and solar farms, highlighting the country's position as the world's undisputed leader in installing new clean energy capacity. The visuals aim to convey the breathtaking speed and physical magnitude of this transformation, which is reshaping landscapes across the nation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is broadly impressed by the scale and aesthetic quality of China's renewable energy projects, but quickly branches into a multifaceted debate about the underlying motivations, global comparisons, and practical trade-offs.

A significant portion of the conversation is a direct comparison between China's approach and that of other nations, particularly the US and UK. While some commenters express sadness or frustration that the US isn't matching China's pace, others push back, arguing that the US is, in fact, building renewables at a high rate, just from a different baseline of energy consumption. The UK is mentioned as a world leader in offshore wind, though one commenter offers a contrasting anecdote about local planning permission hurdles for rooftop solar.

The discussion also delves into the strategic motivations behind China's buildout. One prominent theory suggests it's not just about climate goals, but about creating a resilient, decentralized grid capable of withstanding catastrophic events. This perspective frames the massive investment as a long-term strategic security measure, a concept that some feel is misunderstood in the West.

Technical and philosophical debates about the "best" path forward are also central. Commenters argue over the merits of solar and wind versus nuclear power, with points raised about nuclear's long construction times and high costs versus the land use and material sourcing concerns of renewables. The debate over land use, specifically covering mountains with solar panels, highlights a tension between rapid deployment and environmental aesthetics, with many arguing the urgency of the climate crisis outweighs such concerns. Finally, there is a strong thread of simple appreciation for the photography itself, with several users noting the powerful way the images capture the sheer scale of the engineering feat.

## [25 Years of Wikipedia](https://wikipedia25.org)
**Score:** 461 | **Comments:** 374 | **ID:** 46632023

> **Article:** The article is a special website, wikipedia25.org, created to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Wikipedia. It features a timeline of the project's history, highlighting key milestones, founder reflections, and the evolution from a small experiment to a global encyclopedia. The site serves as a retrospective on Wikipedia's impact and development over the past quarter-century.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Wikipedia's 25th anniversary is multifaceted, blending celebration with significant criticism and forward-looking analysis. A prominent theme is the ongoing controversy surrounding Wikipedia's fundraising practices. Several users express frustration that the Wikimedia Foundation's fundraising is excessive and used to support "off-mission" projects beyond the core encyclopedia, with some noting that the foundation's large endowment should be sufficient to cover Wikipedia's operational costs. This criticism is linked to a broader concern about the organization's transparency and priorities.

Another major topic is the comparison of Wikipedia's future trajectory to that of Stack Overflow. While one commenter predicts a similar decline in contributor engagement and content quality, others counter that Wikipedia's usage and edit rates remain steady, and its fundamental purpose—providing a static reference for reading about a topic—differs from Stack Overflow's Q&A model, which has been more impacted by LLMs.

The discussion also delves into Wikipedia's content quality and neutrality. A recurring point is the perception that articles on politically charged subjects are increasingly partisan, with some users blaming the erosion of neutrality policies (like the concept of "false balance") and increasing societal polarization. However, this view is contested, with one user suggesting the perception of bias may stem from the commenter's own radicalization.

Several technical and historical points are raised. The official "Abstract Wikipedia" project is mentioned as a long-term solution for cross-language content translation, aiming to create a language-agnostic structural representation rather than relying on direct machine translation. A significant historical controversy is highlighted regarding co-founder Larry Sanger's omission from the anniversary narrative, with users pointing out his critical role in Wikipedia's early conceptualization and organization. Finally, there are concerns about Wikipedia's long-term resilience in an increasingly unstable political landscape, with a call for decentralized archiving and the ability to reboot the platform independently.

## [Ask HN: How can we solve the loneliness epidemic?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46635345)
**Score:** 452 | **Comments:** 762 | **ID:** 46635345

> **Question:** A user asks the Hacker News community for solutions to the loneliness epidemic, sharing their personal experience with trauma and social isolation. They describe an unconventional method they've adopted: conducting public surveys on street corners using poster boards to ask strangers questions like "how alone do you feel," which has led to meaningful connections. They ask for new ideas to reach people who feel disconnected and unable to connect with others.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion explores the causes of and potential solutions to loneliness, with commenters offering a mix of personal anecdotes, sociological analysis, and practical suggestions. A key theme is the tension between individual responsibility and systemic societal changes.

Several commenters shared personal stories of isolation, citing childhood trauma, the difficulty of rebuilding social circles after life events like divorce, and the feeling of being "too far gone" in a socially corroded world. One user noted that modern amenities allow people to avoid public interaction entirely, a stark contrast to previous generations where being in public was a necessity. Another commenter, a self-described "deep thinker," suggested that introspection can exacerbate loneliness, even in crowded settings.

Proposed solutions were varied. The original poster's "public survey" idea was well-received, with suggestions to create a "pyramid structure" to scale the effort. Other ideas included creating hyper-local social networks (a "physical social network" for a 1km radius), reviving traditional social clubs like Elks or Moose lodges, and intentionally cultivating community through shared activities like playing guitar in public. The importance of "third places" was implicitly highlighted.

Sociological perspectives were also offered. One user referenced the classic book *Bowling Alone* to frame the issue, while another argued that the "loneliness epidemic" might be overstated, citing high personal satisfaction rates in polls. This was countered by others who pointed out that those satisfaction ratings are at a historic low and that personal experience contradicts the data. The discussion also touched on the nature of online community, with one user arguing it can be a valid form of connection, though it's threatened by AI-generated content.

## [‘ELITE’: The Palantir app ICE uses to find neighborhoods to raid](https://werd.io/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)
**Score:** 364 | **Comments:** 317 | **ID:** 46637127

> **Article:** The article "ELITE": The Palantir App ICE Uses to Find Neighborhoods to Raid" details the use of a Palantir software platform called ELITE by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The app is designed to assist agents in identifying and targeting specific neighborhoods for immigration raids. The piece highlights the role of Palantir in providing data analytics and operational tools to government agencies, focusing on its application in controversial immigration enforcement activities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the ethics of Palantir's technology, the role of its employees, and the broader U.S. immigration policy.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on Palantir's technology itself. Some commenters downplay its sophistication, describing it as a "typical enterprise vendor" product—a "dashboard" built on a graph database and hyped by consultants rather than a uniquely powerful or "demonic" tool. They argue that the real issue isn't Palantir's software, but the policy decisions that lead agencies like ICE to purchase such systems. Others counter that the presentation of "probabilistic information" in a dashboard is dangerous, especially when used by agents with minimal training, and will inevitably lead to wrongful arrests and civil rights violations.

The moral culpability of Palantir's employees is a major point of contention. One commenter draws a parallel to historical justifications, stating that "I was only in charge of transport" is not a valid excuse. Another warns developers to consider what they are building and whether they are merely "doing what they are told." This view is supported by a sentiment that Palantir was founded to help the government circumvent privacy regulations by outsourcing legally questionable data activities to a private contractor.

The discussion also branches into broader political and social critiques. Commenters link the technology to U.S. foreign policy, suggesting it was "beta-tested on Palestinians" and citing the "imperial boomerang" theory, where tactics honed abroad are eventually used domestically. The conversation also touches on U.S. immigration policy, with a debate over whether mass deportations are a necessary reality or a cruel and unconstitutional policy, and whether previous administrations were fundamentally different in their approach.

Finally, some users express deep disillusionment with the tech industry, with one commenter stating they left the field due to its perceived shift towards authoritarianism and "AI slop," hoping for a market correction.

## [To those who fired or didn't hire tech writers because of AI](https://passo.uno/letter-those-who-fired-tech-writers-ai/)
**Score:** 324 | **Comments:** 236 | **ID:** 46629474

> **Article:** The article is a letter addressed to companies that have fired or declined to hire technical writers in favor of AI. It argues that AI is a poor replacement for human tech writers because it lacks the essential human qualities of empathy, critical thinking, and the ability to truly understand a user's context and pain points. The author contends that good tech writing is not just about transcribing information but about observing, listening, and acting as a proxy for the end-user, a role that AI cannot fulfill. The piece warns that relying on AI for documentation will lead to a degradation of product quality, user experience, and ultimately, the company's reputation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide on the future of tech writing in the age of AI, with arguments centered on the nature of the job, the current and future capabilities of AI, and market dynamics.

A significant portion of commenters, including several self-identified tech writers, strongly defend the profession's value. They argue that the job is not merely about writing but about synthesis, empathy, and acting as a crucial bridge between engineers, product managers, and users. These commenters (e.g., `sehugg`, `drob518`, `nicbou`) emphasize that good tech writers act as "anthropologists" or the "first user," identifying usability problems and clarifying complex concepts in ways that AI currently cannot. They contend that AI-generated documentation is often inaccurate, lacks context, and requires heavy human editing to be useful.

On the other side, skeptics question the value and quality of traditional tech writing. Some commenters (`murderfs`) share negative experiences, claiming that human-written docs are often just as flawed as AI-generated ones, sometimes documenting an idealized version of the product rather than its reality. A more forward-looking perspective (`InMice`, `NitpickLawyer`) suggests that the arguments against AI are based on its current limitations and fail to account for its rapid improvement. The "bitter lesson" of AI's progress is invoked, with the prediction that "agentic" systems capable of self-correction will soon match or exceed the quality of human-written docs for the majority of projects.

Finally, the discussion touches on the economic and market realities. One commenter (`Nextgrid`) raises a critical point: in many industries with little competition, the incentive to produce high-quality documentation is low. If a "good enough" AI solution can produce docs that don't significantly impact revenue, companies will opt for the cheaper, faster option, regardless of its qualitative shortcomings. This suggests that even if human writers are technically superior, market forces may favor AI replacement.

## [Raspberry Pi's New AI Hat Adds 8GB of RAM for Local LLMs](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/)
**Score:** 238 | **Comments:** 197 | **ID:** 46629682

> **Article:** The article, by Jeff Geerling, reviews the Raspberry Pi AI HAT, which adds 8GB of RAM and a Hailo 10H accelerator to a Raspberry Pi 5 for local AI tasks. Geerling finds the product underwhelming. He notes that the Pi's own CPU is often faster than the Hailo chip for many tasks, and the HAT's software support is currently poor, with examples not yet updated and compatibility issues. He concludes that the HAT is a niche product that struggles to justify its cost and complexity compared to simpler or more powerful alternatives.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely critical of the Raspberry Pi AI HAT and Raspberry Pi's broader strategy. Commenters echo the article's sentiment, calling the product's specs "underwhelming" and a case of "AI marketing" where the numbers don't translate to a good user experience.

A major theme is Raspberry Pi's perceived loss of direction. Several users argue the company has lost its original "magic" for tinkerers and is now aimlessly jumping on trends like AI. They contend that the niche for cheap, capable single-board computers has been overtaken by competitors, and for the price of a new Pi 5, one can get a much more powerful used laptop. The consensus is that Raspberry Pi now primarily caters to industrial and commercial users who value its reliability and GPIO support over raw performance.

Technical criticism of the HAT is sharp. Users point out the Hailo accelerator's poor performance compared to the Pi's own CPU, its "laughable" 32-bit bus, and its sparse software support, which is a significant barrier for developers using popular distros like Ubuntu.

Despite the criticism, some potential use-cases for small LLMs on a Pi are discussed, such as fine-tuned models for very specific tasks (e.g., a natural language interface for a smart home). However, the overall tone remains skeptical, with commenters questioning the necessity of such hardware for applications where software-based computer vision is already sufficient.

> **Article:** The article is a personal blog post by a software engineer who, after experiencing burnout and health issues, underwent a spiritual awakening. He concluded that modern careers are largely meaningless or evil, and that the only spiritually valid paths are farming or artisan work. He describes his journey of leaving his tech job, reading the Bible, and moving to an island to start a farm, finding new meaning in physical labor and connection with nature.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is a nuanced debate on the article's themes of career dissatisfaction, spirituality, and the ideal of returning to the land. While many commenters express empathy for the author's burnout and support their pursuit of happiness, there is significant skepticism about the practicality and romanticism of the "move to a farm" narrative.

Key discussion points include:
*   **Practicality and Profitability:** Several users, including one who tried a similar path and had to sell their farm, questioned the financial viability of small-scale farming. Others discussed the challenges of selling produce directly to consumers versus using intermediaries, with some offering examples of successful direct-to-consumer models and suggesting how software skills could be leveraged for marketing and e-commerce.
*   **Critique of the "All-or-Nothing" Approach:** Commenters debated whether such a radical life change was necessary. Some argued for incremental steps, like maintaining a hobby farm or finding meaning within a tech career (e.g., working on public good projects). Others defended the "cold turkey" approach, comparing it to quitting an addiction, and suggested the farm move was a symptom of deeper, unaddressed issues.
*   **The Romanticism of Manual Labor:** Several participants pushed back against the idealization of farming, sharing their own experiences with physically demanding jobs and arguing that they were less comfortable and fulfilling than office work. The counterpoint was made that the author's happiness is what matters, regardless of the path.
*   **The Definition of a Meaningful Career:** The article's core claim that only farming or artisan work are meaningful sparked debate. Commenters expanded this list to include artists, teachers, doctors, and firefighters. Others argued that software engineering itself can be meaningful and that the author's negative view was too narrow.

Briar uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to enable direct, peer-to-peer communication between devices, creating a decentralized mesh network. This allows users to maintain contact during internet shutdowns, such as those implemented by governments during protests, as is the case in Iran. The app is primarily available on Android.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is generally positive, with users celebrating Briar as a "magnificent project" and a vital tool for maintaining communication during internet blackouts. However, the conversation quickly expands to cover practical limitations, alternative technologies, and usability concerns.

A central theme is the technical feasibility and practicality of such mesh networks. Users question how the app works over distance, with one commenter clarifying that messages are relayed peer-to-peer from one user to the next. There is significant skepticism about the effectiveness of similar technologies like Meshtastic, with one user arguing that military forces could easily locate and disable repeater nodes. Another user raises a security concern about Meshtastic, questioning if compromised nodes could lead to intercepted messages.

The discussion also compares Briar to alternatives like Bitchat. While some see Bitchat as a viable option, others point out its limitation to iOS devices, which are less common in regions like Iran compared to more affordable Android phones. A user notes that Briar's reliance on Android makes it more accessible for its intended use case.

Finally, several comments address Briar's direct usability. One user expresses frustration with its limitations, citing poor media quality, a slow desktop app, and the inability to delete forums. In response, another user suggests a practical use case: pre-installing the app as a preparedness measure for emergencies like natural disasters, where it can be invaluable for connecting with others at community relief points.

## [Why senior engineers let bad projects fail](https://lalitm.com/post/why-senior-engineers-let-bad-projects-fail/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46640366

> **Article:** The article "Why senior engineers let bad projects fail" argues that experienced engineers should not try to save every failing project. The author contends that attempting to intervene often leads to burnout, political backlash, and being labeled as negative or obstructionist. Instead, senior engineers should strategically choose their battles, focusing their energy on projects where they have influence and where the stakes are high. The core message is that part of seniority is recognizing when a project is doomed due to organizational dysfunction or poor leadership and conserving your political and emotional capital rather than going down with the ship. It's about self-preservation and long-term effectiveness over short-term heroics.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharp divide on the ethics and practicality of letting projects fail. A central tension exists between personal responsibility and organizational health.

Many commenters agree with the article's pragmatic core, framing inaction as a strategic necessity. They argue that engineers are often "replaceable cogs" without the political power to change course, and that constantly fighting unwinnable battles is a recipe for burnout. This camp emphasizes "choosing your battles" and saving energy for when it truly matters, viewing employment as a business transaction rather than a moral crusade.

However, a significant counter-argument focuses on ethics and collective responsibility. Opponents of the "let it fail" approach call it "self-serving" and "amoral," pointing out that allowing a project to collapse wastes company resources, harms team morale, and ultimately damages the organization everyone works for. They argue that it's a senior engineer's duty to speak up, even at personal risk, to prevent a larger tragedy.

A third, more nuanced perspective emerges that blends these views. This group suggests a middle path: speak up once to voice concerns, but don't carry the emotional burden if your advice is ignored. The key is to inform stakeholders and then disengage from the outcome. Commenters also highlighted the importance of context, noting that this dynamic is especially prevalent in large, political organizations like big tech, where "organizational gangrene" can fester. Ultimately, the debate centers on whether an engineer's primary loyalty is to their own well-being and career or to the success of the company's projects.

## [UK offshore wind prices come in 40% cheaper than gas in record auction](https://electrek.co/2026/01/14/uk-offshore-wind-record-auction/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46637399

> **Article:** The article reports on a UK government auction for renewable energy contracts, where offshore wind projects secured record-low prices. The winning bid for offshore wind was £58.87 per megawatt-hour (MWh), which is 40% cheaper than the estimated cost of new gas-fired power plants (£91.20/MWh). This is part of the UK's Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme, a subsidy mechanism that guarantees a fixed "strike price" for generators, providing revenue stability and locking in low costs for consumers over the long term.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the complexities of electricity pricing and whether the reported "cheap" wind prices will translate to lower consumer bills. A primary theme is the UK's electricity market structure, where all power is sold at the marginal price of the most expensive source needed to meet demand (typically gas). Commenters debate this system, with some calling it "insane" for making consumers pay gas prices for cheap renewable energy, while others defend it as a rational mechanism for price discovery that ensures all generators are fairly compensated.

Another key theme is the true cost of energy. Several commenters argue that the article's comparison is misleading because it doesn't account for hidden costs associated with renewables, such as grid upgrades and the need for backup power to handle intermittency. Conversely, others point out that gas prices should include externalities like carbon taxes and that the capacity market already exists to compensate backup power plants. The discussion also delves into the technical assumptions behind the government's cost estimates for gas power, with one commenter critiquing the methodology for using low efficiency and load factor figures.

Finally, there's a debate on consumer behavior and demand-side management. While one commenter claims it's impractical for consumers to adapt to fluctuating electricity prices, another counters with a personal anecdote from France, suggesting it's possible with the right systems in place.

> **Article:** The Svelte team announced several CVEs affecting the Svelte ecosystem, primarily centered on the `devalue` library used for serialization. The vulnerabilities include Denial of Service (DoS) via memory/CPU exhaustion and one instance of XSS. The most severe issues require specific experimental features to be enabled, such as Remote Functions or `hydratable`. The team advises upgrading and notes that static builds are not affected.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely viewed these vulnerabilities as manageable and less severe than recent high-profile CVEs in other frameworks like React. A key point of consensus was the limited blast radius, as most of the critical vulnerabilities require "Remote Functions"—an experimental feature—to be enabled. Several users noted that these types of parsing vulnerabilities are common across web frameworks, citing similar historical issues in Go. While some users expressed long-standing skepticism regarding the `devalue` library's handling of user input, the overall sentiment was that the Svelte team handled the disclosure well and that the risks are minimal for users not utilizing experimental features.

## [Design and Implementation of Sprites](https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46634450

> **Article:** The article "Design and Implementation of Sprites" introduces Sprites, a new product from Fly.io. Sprites are described as highly ephemeral, hardware-isolated Linux shells that can be created in about 1.5 seconds. They are designed to be cheap (costing virtually nothing when idle) and durable, featuring a persistent disk. The post details the underlying architecture, highlighting a decentralized orchestrator where the source of truth for each VM is owned by the physical machine it runs on. For global state (apps, organizations, services), Sprites use a novel design where each organization gets a separate SQLite database, synchronized to object storage using Litestream.io. This approach is presented as a scalable alternative to traditional centralized databases like Postgres for this specific use case.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, with participants exploring the technical architecture, practical use cases, and product maturity of Sprites.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the technical implementation. Fly.io engineers, including tptacek and chrismccord, elaborated on the system's design. They explained that while the orchestrator keeps the source of truth for each VM decentralized, the global state is managed by a "multiple SQLite database" design, with each organization having its own database synced via Litestream. This was highlighted as an under-appreciated architectural pattern. chrismccord provided a concrete example of how this works in practice using Elixir and Phoenix, where an RPC call can execute code on a remote node that has direct access to its local SQLite database, effectively creating a distributed SQLite system while treating it as locally reachable.

Use cases and practical experiences were also widely discussed. Users like roywiggins shared positive experiences using Sprites for development, such as running OpenCode's webui for "vibe coding" a website from a phone. Others identified the primary benefit as the ability to spin up disposable development environments or "dev boxes" for rapid prototyping, especially with coding agents, due to the fast creation time.

However, the product's polish and documentation received significant criticism. Multiple commenters, including MrOrelliOReilly and el_nahual, pointed out that the documentation is sparse, the CLI is unintuitive, and the overall experience lacks the final 10% of polish expected from a usable product. tptacek acknowledged these issues, stating that the team's philosophy is to ship early and iterate, and that waiting for perfect polish would be a mistake. Other users reported bugs, such as sprites failing to suspend properly, though an engineer confirmed a fix was being rolled out.

Finally, there was some confusion and debate around the product's name and positioning. While some commenters were disappointed the article wasn't about graphical sprites, others defended the name. A few users perceived the product as overly focused on AI agents, a sentiment tptacek countered by emphasizing its broader utility as a fast, cheap, hardware-isolated environment.

## [Linux boxes via SSH: suspended when disconected](https://shellbox.dev/)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46638629

> **Article:** The article links to Shellbox.dev, a service that provides ephemeral Linux virtual machines accessible via SSH. The core value proposition is cost savings: the VMs automatically suspend (shut down) when the SSH session is disconnected, and users are only billed for the time the machine is actively running, rather than for idle time or storage. The service is designed for simplicity, abstracting away the need to manage a traditional VPS or web consoles.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the service's pricing model, technical implementation, and specific use cases. A key point of contention is the cost-effectiveness compared to traditional VPS providers. While the suspended state is cheap, commenters noted that the base price ($36/month for higher specs) is high, and even the suspended rate ($0.005/hour) could make it more expensive than a cheap, always-on VPS if used for a few hours daily. The developer acknowledged this and expressed a willingness to revise pricing.

Technical questions focused on the underlying stack, which the developer revealed uses Python, AsyncSSH, Firecracker for VMs, and runs on bare metal servers. Users also requested features like SFTP support (currently WIP), a "keepalive" option to prevent suspension, and persistence via external storage like Dropbox.

There was confusion around the signup process, which requires generating an SSH key first, and comparisons were drawn to similar services like exe.dev and Fly's sprites. Security concerns were raised regarding the payment provider and the potential for misuse, with a suggestion to accept Lightning payments for lower fees. Overall, the community was intrigued by the concept but skeptical about its practical cost savings for regular use.

## [The 3D Software Rendering Technology of 1998's Thief: The Dark Project (2019)](https://nothings.org/gamedev/thief_rendering.html)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 53 | **ID:** 46630798

> **Article:** The article provides a technical deep-dive into the software rendering engine of the 1998 game *Thief: The Dark Project*. It explains how the engine handled complex geometry and lighting, specifically focusing on the "surface cache" system. This system was a form of texture caching that pre-calculated and stored blended textures and lightmaps to maintain high performance in a software-only environment, avoiding the need for expensive filtering calculations every frame. The piece details the challenges of rendering detailed 3D worlds without dedicated hardware acceleration and the clever optimizations used to achieve the game's distinctive atmospheric look.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion, while sparked by a technical article, largely focused on the nostalgic and artistic impact of *Thief* and its contemporaries. Many commenters shared personal memories of using the game's level editor (Dromed), noting its power for creating complex geometry but also its instability and steep learning curve.

A key theme was the comparison between late-90s 3D games. Commenters reminisced about the robust software renderers in titles like *Unreal*, which were impressive enough to function without a graphics card. However, the conversation quickly pivoted from graphics to audio. Several users argued that *Thief*'s true legacy was its masterful sound design and ambient audio, which created a deep sense of immersion that they feel is often missing in modern, more graphically realistic games.

The thread also served as a hub for fans to share resources. Recommendations were made for modern fan-made projects, including the massive mod *The Black Parade* for *Thief*, the standalone game *The Dark Mod* (a recreation in the Doom 3 engine), and other fan missions. Finally, commenters pointed to further resources for those interested in the history of the game and its developer, Looking Glass Studios, including video interviews and historical articles.

## [Found: Medieval Cargo Ship – Largest Vessel of Its Kind Ever](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-say-theyve-unearthed-a-massive-medieval-cargo-ship-thats-the-largest-vessel-of-its-kind-ever-found-180987984/)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 31 | **ID:** 46633574

> **Article:** Archaeologists have discovered the remains of a massive medieval cargo ship, identified as a cog, in the Øresund strait between Denmark and Sweden. Dating to the 14th century, it is the largest vessel of its kind ever found, measuring nearly 27 meters (89 feet) long. The ship's construction reveals a mix of materials, with planks made of Pomeranian oak and framing from Dutch timber, indicating a sophisticated, long-distance trade network. The wreck is remarkably well-preserved due to the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea, which lack the shipworms that typically destroy wooden wrecks. A key discovery is the intact remains of a "castle"—a raised, covered deck structure at the stern—which had been documented in historical records but never before physically identified on a cog.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on this archaeological find is multifaceted, touching on the historical context, the state of digital media, and related historical artifacts.

Several commenters provided valuable context about the ship and its era. The vessel is identified as a cog, a type of single-masted ship central to the Hanseatic League's trade network. Users noted the remarkable economics of sourcing raw materials from across the Baltic—Pomeranian oak from modern-day Poland and framing from the Netherlands—and connected this to the vast bulk-goods trade of the time, which stretched from London to Novgorod. The discovery of the stern "castle" was highlighted as a significant find, explaining the etymology of the modern nautical term "forecastle." The excellent preservation of the wreck was attributed to the brackish Baltic Sea, which inhibits the organisms that normally decompose wood. The depth of the find (under 40 feet of water) was also discussed, with commenters noting that this is not unusually deep for the region and that many wrecks are found in shallower waters.

A significant portion of the discussion centered on the source article itself. One commenter complained about the aggressive video pop-up ads on the Smithsonian Magazine's mobile site, a sentiment that sparked a debate on the economics of online media. Others defended the publication, arguing that high-quality, research-intensive journalism requires revenue streams like ads or subscriptions, and lamenting that many readers are unwilling to pay for content.

Finally, users drew parallels to other famous shipwrecks. The Vasa, a nearly intact 17th-century warship preserved and displayed in Stockholm, was mentioned as a more famous, though younger, example. A nostalgic comment also referenced the classic video game *Patrician II/III*, which features Hanseatic League trade and shipbuilding, adding a personal, cultural layer to the discussion.
