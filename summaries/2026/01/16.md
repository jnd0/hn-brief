## [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com/)
**Score:** 382 | **Comments:** 209 | **ID:** 46645615

> **Article:** The article introduces "Just the Browser," a project that provides scripts to configure web browsers (specifically Firefox and Chrome) for a more minimal, privacy-focused experience. The scripts aim to remove modern features deemed unnecessary or intrusive, such as AI integrations (like Copilot), shopping tools, and telemetry. The project's philosophy is to strip the browser back to its core function: a tool for accessing web content, reminiscent of simpler, earlier eras of the internet. It also offers manual configuration steps for users who prefer not to run third-party scripts.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of nostalgia, skepticism, and debate over browser functionality and security. A central theme is a longing for the perceived simplicity and innovation of the past, with users reminiscing about the excitement of early web standards and UI controls, contrasting it with the current "over-innovative" and inconsistent web experience. This sentiment fuels the appeal of a stripped-down browser.

However, the project's implementation drew significant criticism. Several users flagged the security risks of running third-party shell scripts with elevated privileges (sudo/admin access) to modify browser configurations, arguing that the manual process is safer. The project's creator responded by explaining that these permissions are necessary to access protected system directories.

The discussion also branched into broader topics:
*   **AI and "Enshittification":** Users debated the anti-AI stance of the project. While some saw it as a justified reaction to tech hype, others felt it was reactionary. The absence of Safari from the project was noted, with speculation that Apple's lack of a major AI product keeps Safari from similar "bloat."
*   **Browser Trust:** Personal anecdotes about browsers like Chrome downloading large AI files in the background without clear UI prompts fueled distrust and reinforced the desire for more transparent, minimal software.
*   **Telemetry Efficacy:** A debate emerged over whether Mozilla's telemetry actually helps improve Firefox, with some users arguing that years of data collection have correlated with stagnation rather than improvement.

## [OpenBSD-current now runs as guest under Apple Hypervisor](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20260115203619)
**Score:** 377 | **Comments:** 51 | **ID:** 46642560

> **Article:** The article from undeadly.org announces that OpenBSD-current (the development version) can now run as a guest operating system under Apple's native Virtualization.framework on Apple Silicon. This marks a significant step in bringing full graphical and networking support to OpenBSD VMs on Mac hardware without relying on third-party solutions like QEMU.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community welcomed the news, noting the technical significance of the update. Several users clarified the distinction between Apple's frameworks, pointing out that while OpenBSD has long supported Hypervisor.framework (for low-level access), this update specifically targets Virtualization.framework (Apple's higher-level VMM), which is often confused due to similar naming.

Key technical takeaways included:
*   **Graphics and Networking:** The update resolves a long-standing "black-screen-of-death" issue with the `viogpu` driver, moving away from the previous reliance on serial console installations. It also addresses a specific `VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU` negotiation bug that had been a roadblock for guest OS implementations on Apple's stack.
*   **QEMU Compatibility:** A specific bug causing OpenBSD to hang when starting X on QEMU (introduced in version 7.3) is also fixed, making OpenBSD more accessible for users on Apple hardware.
*   **Use Cases:** Commenters highlighted the utility of running OpenBSD on high-performance M4/M5 chips for local development, specifically for testing `pf` configurations or running isolated services like mail servers.
*   **Security:** A discussion on security isolation clarified that while the host VMM can technically access guest memory, OpenBSD does support hardware-based confidential computing features (like AMD SEV) on supported hardware, though this is less relevant to the Apple Silicon context.
*   **Comparisons:** Users compared the progress to FreeBSD (which currently struggles with X on UTM) and discussed the theoretical benefits of unikernels for specific workloads.

Overall, the sentiment was positive, with users expressing gratitude toward the developers (specifically Helg and Stefan) for the improvements.

## [STFU](https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/stfu)
**Score:** 355 | **Comments:** 237 | **ID:** 46649142

> **Article:** The post links to a GitHub repository for a project named "STFU," which appears to be a tool designed to silence loud speakers in public spaces. The project likely utilizes "delayed auditory feedback" (DAF)—a technique that replays a person's own voice back to them with a delay, which is known to disrupt speech and concentration. The concept is compared to a gag from the TV show *Seinfeld* involving "Chinese food" that causes a delay in conversation.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the technical feasibility, social ethics, and personal experiences related to using delayed auditory feedback to silence noisy individuals in public.

**Technical Mechanism and History**
Commenters quickly identified the underlying technology as Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF), noting that it is a known phenomenon used in speech pathology and audio engineering. Several users shared personal experiences with DAF, describing it as a disorienting effect that makes speaking or playing music difficult. One user recalled the annoyance of hearing their own voice on older cell phone networks, while another noted that a delay of "a few hundred milliseconds" is more effective for jamming than the "2 seconds" mentioned in the linked article.

**Social and Ethical Debate**
A significant portion of the debate focused on the morality of the tool:
*   **Confrontation vs. Technology:** Some argued that using the app is cowardly or malicious compared to simply asking someone to lower their volume. However, others countered that asking can be socially difficult or risky, and that the app removes the need for direct confrontation.
*   **Public Etiquette:** Users debated whether public spaces grant the right to be loud. While one commenter argued that society is becoming too intolerant and conformist, others defended the need for courtesy, particularly in enclosed spaces like airports.
*   **Effectiveness:** Skepticism was raised regarding whether loud individuals—often characterized as not caring about social norms—would be deterred by hearing their own voice, or if they would simply perceive it as an additional noise source.

**Related Anecdotes**
The conversation branched out into similar "pranks" or tools for controlling public electronics. Users discussed "TV-B-Gone" devices (IR remotes that turn off TVs) and shared stories of using IR-capable phones to mute breakroom TVs. These anecdotes highlighted a shared frustration with unwanted noise in public and the desire for personal control over one's environment.

**Score:** 316 | **Comments:** 102 | **ID:** 46641284

> **Article:** The article is a Wikipedia page titled "List of individual trees." It serves as a directory of trees that are notable for historical, cultural, or botanical reasons, rather than being a general list of tree species. The page categorizes these trees by location and significance, including famous specimens like the General Sherman tree, historical landmarks, and trees with unique stories. It is presented as a comprehensive but not exhaustive collection, highlighting Wikipedia's role in documenting niche subjects that traditional encyclopedias might overlook.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded to the Wikipedia list with a mix of appreciation, humor, and curiosity. Many commenters enjoyed the "human interest" aspect of the list, finding it more relatable and fascinating than a simple botanical catalog. The discussion highlighted the page's value in preserving obscure but culturally significant records, with users pointing out that such entries (like the "Fuck Tree" in Hampstead Heath) would never appear in traditional encyclopedias.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on specific, notable trees mentioned in the comments. Users shared personal experiences with ancient trees like the Methuselah Pine, discussed the viral story of the Sycamore Gap tree's illegal felling in the UK, and debated the mechanics of trees growing around objects like gravestones or bicycles. There was also a humorous thread regarding the inclusion of a tree known for its use in a gay cruising area, with some users debating its notability and factual basis. Overall, the discussion celebrated the list's ability to capture the unique personalities and stories attached to individual trees around the world.

## [Canada slashes 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs to 6%](https://electrek.co/2026/01/16/canada-breaks-with-us-slashes-100-tariffs-chinese-evs/)
**Score:** 312 | **Comments:** 374 | **ID:** 46648778

> **Article:** According to an article from Electrek, Canada has significantly reduced its tariff on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) from 100% to 6%. This policy change includes an initial import quota of 49,000 vehicles, which is scheduled to increase to 70,000 over the next five years. This move represents a notable shift in trade policy, particularly given the proximity and economic ties to the United States, which maintains high tariffs on Chinese EVs.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion regarding Canada's tariff reduction on Chinese EVs is multifaceted, touching on geopolitics, market competition, and security concerns. A prominent theme is the political framing of the decision, with one commenter sarcastically attributing the policy to a "Trump success," arguing it aligns with the goals of U.S. adversaries. This sparked a brief debate about the specifics of such geopolitical motivations.

A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the competitive impact on the automotive industry, specifically Tesla. While some users speculated this would force Tesla to produce cheaper vehicles, others countered that the company is focused on high margins and that CEO Elon Musk's decisions are not always driven by market realities. Broader market effects were also discussed, with commenters noting that the 49,000-vehicle quota is a small fraction of Canada's total annual car sales but a substantial portion of its current EV market. Many argued that the influx of Chinese EVs would benefit consumers by forcing Western manufacturers to innovate, with several commenters asserting that Chinese EVs are already technologically superior to their Western counterparts.

Finally, security and privacy implications were raised. Commenters pointed to existing restrictions on Chinese EVs in sensitive locations, such as UK military bases, and drew parallels to bans on Chinese drones (like DJI) in infrastructure inspection, highlighting ongoing concerns about data collection and national security.

## [Linux boxes via SSH: suspended when disconected](https://shellbox.dev/)
**Score:** 285 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46638629

> **Article:** The article links to shellbox.dev, a service that provides ephemeral Linux boxes via SSH. The core concept is that these virtual machines are suspended (and thus stop incurring costs) when the SSH session is disconnected, offering a pay-per-use model for on-demand command-line environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on the service's pricing model, technical implementation, and potential use cases. A key point of debate was the cost-effectiveness of the suspended state fee ($0.005/hour), with one user arguing that for the same price, a traditional VPS from a provider like Hetzner offers 24/7 uptime with a public IP. The developer acknowledged this feedback, stating they would revise the pricing to be more competitive.

Several users compared shellbox.dev to other services. It was likened to exe.dev (a subscription-based alternative) and Fly.io's sprites, with the main differentiator for shellbox being its pay-per-connection model. The developer revealed the technical stack, which includes Python, AsyncSSH, Firecracker for VMs, and runs on large bare-metal servers. They also expressed interest in potentially open-sourcing the project.

Use cases and feature requests were also discussed. While some questioned the practicality compared to a standard VPS, others saw value in its simplicity and "fun" aspect for remote development or temporary environments. A notable feature request was the ability to keep a box running for a short period after disconnection, which the developer is considering. Other suggestions included using external storage (like Dropbox) for persistence to avoid storage charges and improving the payment system by accepting Lightning Network payments for lower fees.

## [Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, NTSB report says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly56w0p9e1o)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 133 | **ID:** 46642920

> **Article:** A new NTSB report reveals that Boeing was aware of a flaw in a specific part of the UPS Boeing 747-400 that crashed in Dubai in 2010, resulting in the deaths of the crew. The report indicates that Boeing had identified the issue and communicated it to airlines as early as 2011, stating at the time that the flaw "would not result in a safety of flight condition." The crash was attributed to a failure of the "outboard ailerat power control unit" (PCU), which led to an uncommanded roll and subsequent fire. The article highlights the tension between Boeing's assessment of the risk and the eventual fatal outcome.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses heavily on Boeing's corporate responsibility and the reliability of its risk assessments. A central theme is the distinction between technical risk management and corporate negligence. Commenters argue that while all complex technology has flaws, Boeing's history—specifically the 737 MAX and MCAS crises—has eroded trust, making it difficult to accept their assessment that a known flaw was "safe." There is skepticism that Boeing properly weighed the cost of a potential failure against the cost of a fix, with one user noting the difference between an unforeseen flaw and knowingly accepting the risk of fatalities.

The conversation also touches on aircraft maintenance and aging fleets. Users discuss the rigorous "D-check" maintenance cycles required for older aircraft (the crashed plane was nearly 30 years old), questioning if visual inspections are sufficient for detecting metal fatigue in hard-to-reach components. There is a consensus that blaming maintenance crews—a tactic often employed after crashes—may be premature given the inaccessibility of the failed part.

Finally, the discussion broadens to include general skepticism toward Boeing's current engineering capabilities, with commenters expressing fear for upcoming missions like the Artemis moon launch. Comparisons are drawn to historical aircraft like the DC-10 and the high-risk, high-failure-rate SR-71 program, though other users counter that commercial aviation safety standards are significantly higher today. The thread concludes with a cynical view on regulatory corruption, questioning the integrity of investigations in the current political climate.

## [Why senior engineers let bad projects fail](https://lalitm.com/post/why-senior-engineers-let-bad-projects-fail/)
**Score:** 250 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 46640366

> **Article:** The article "Why senior engineers let bad projects fail" argues that experienced engineers should strategically choose when to intervene. The author contends that constantly fighting against flawed projects is draining and often ineffective, especially in large organizations where political capital is limited. Instead of trying to save every failing initiative, senior engineers should focus their energy on battles they can win and projects that truly matter. The article suggests that letting a bad project fail can be a learning experience for the team and a necessary step to preserve the engineer's own mental bandwidth and influence for more critical issues. It frames this not as apathy, but as a mature, strategic approach to career longevity and impact.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharp divide between pragmatic career preservation and ethical responsibility. A central theme is the tension between "letting it fail" to avoid burnout and "speaking up" to prevent organizational waste. Many commenters, particularly those with experience in large corporations, agree with the article's premise, viewing employment as a transactional relationship where one should not carry the emotional burden of others' poor decisions. They emphasize that seniority involves knowing which battles to fight and conserving political capital.

However, a significant counter-argument emerges on ethical grounds. Several users contend that knowingly allowing a project to fail is "amoral" and harmful to the company and colleagues. They argue that the true mark of seniority is the wisdom to intervene when the stakes are high, even at personal risk. The discussion also highlights the practical reality of corporate politics, where engineers often lack the authority to stop bad projects and may even face blame if they openly oppose them. A recurring piece of advice is to voice concerns once, clearly, and then disengage if they are ignored, thereby fulfilling a professional duty without becoming emotionally invested in the outcome. Ultimately, the consensus leans toward a balanced, strategic approach: speak up when it matters, but don't sacrifice your own well-being for projects that are doomed or politically untouchable.

## [6-Day and IP Address Certificates Are Generally Available](https://letsencrypt.org/2026/01/15/6day-and-ip-general-availability)
**Score:** 214 | **Comments:** 124 | **ID:** 46647491

> **Article:** Let's Encrypt has announced the general availability of two new certificate types: 6-day certificates and IP address certificates. The 6-day certificates are extremely short-lived, designed for highly automated environments to enhance security by reducing the window of vulnerability if a key is compromised. The IP address certificates allow TLS encryption for publicly routable IP addresses without needing a domain name, which is useful for ephemeral services, internal infrastructure, or scenarios where DNS management is cumbersome or undesirable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with a mix of practical advice, skepticism about the short lifetimes, and curiosity about use cases.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on tooling support. Users quickly noted that `certbot`, the most popular ACME client, does not yet support IP address certificates, though a pull request is open. Commenters provided workarounds, recommending clients like `acme.sh` and `lego`, and sharing specific command-line examples for obtaining these certificates. Support in other tools like Caddy, Traefik, and cert-manager was also debated, with some users clarifying that Caddy has supported this for about a year.

The extremely short 6-day validity period sparked considerable debate. While some saw it as a necessary step for high-security, ephemeral infrastructure, many others expressed concern about the operational burden. Critics argued that a 6-day window leaves little room for error, automation failures, or debugging, potentially leading to outages. Some suggested this approach is only viable for mature, fully automated setups and that commercial certificates might be better for less dynamic environments.

Regarding use cases, commenters identified the primary benefit of IP certificates as decoupling TLS from DNS, which is ideal for ephemeral cloud services or anonymous setups. However, limitations were noted: these certificates only work for publicly routable IPs, so they don't solve TLS for local development or LAN devices. The discussion also briefly touched on the potential for `.onion` certificates and the philosophical question of whether IP addresses are truly more "transient" than domain names in all contexts.

## [Michelangelo's first painting, created when he was 12 or 13](https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/discover-michelangelos-first-painting.html)
**Score:** 212 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46646263

> **Article:** The article from Open Culture discusses a painting attributed to Michelangelo, created when he was approximately 12 or 13 years old. The work depicts demons attacking St. Anthony and is notable for being the only Michelangelo painting in the Americas and one of only four easel paintings attributed to him. The article highlights the precocity of his skill at such a young age.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily revolves around the context and authenticity of the painting, rather than just its artistic merit. A central point of clarification is that the work is not an original composition but a painted copy of a famous engraving by Martin Schongauer, "The Temptation of St. Anthony." Several users emphasize that this was a "master study," a common practice for art students of the era, and not the first time the young Michelangelo had ever picked up a brush.

There is also significant skepticism regarding the painting's attribution. Commenters point out the difficulty of definitively attributing works from this period to a single artist versus a workshop, and some suggest the museum's board may have a vested interest in the claim. The discussion touches on broader themes, such as the nature of prodigy versus practice—arguing that such skill is the result of years of focused training rather than innate, magical talent—and a counterfactual debate on whether modern distractions or improved access to materials would result in more or fewer "Michelangelos" today.

## [Interactive eBPF](https://ebpf.party/)
**Score:** 178 | **Comments:** 8 | **ID:** 46644181

> **Article:** The article links to "ebpf.party," an interactive learning platform for eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter). The site provides hands-on exercises designed to help developers learn how to write and run eBPF programs directly in the browser, lowering the barrier to entry for this complex kernel technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response to the platform was overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing gratitude to the creator and enthusiasm for having a practical way to learn eBPF. Commenters highlighted the site's value for those intimidated by the technology's complexity and suggested potential future expansions, such as adding lessons on deployment strategies (like libbcc vs. CO-RE) or compiling the content into a book.

A single critical thread emerged regarding security, with a user questioning if eBPF's flexibility creates a massive attack surface and facilitates rootkit development. This was countered by the clarification that modern systems require the specific `cap_bpf` capability to load programs, mitigating some of these risks.

## [Tldraw pauses external contributions due to AI slop](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46641042

> **Article:** The tldraw project has paused accepting external contributions on GitHub due to a flood of low-quality, AI-generated pull requests ("slop"). The project's maintainers stated that the time required to review these automated submissions has become overwhelming, outweighing any potential benefit. They indicated they might reopen contributions in the future if GitHub introduces better management tools to filter such content.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the tldraw team's decision, framing the influx of AI-generated code as a systemic issue that is shifting the burden of open-source maintenance from writing code to reviewing it. Many commenters predict that this will lead to increased maintainer burnout, as reviewing code is generally considered less satisfying than writing it, and the volume of low-quality submissions is demoralizing.

A central debate emerged regarding the project's own role in attracting this behavior. Some users pointed out that tldraw had previously created detailed instructions and scripts specifically for AI agents (such as a `CONTEXT.md` file), suggesting they invited the automated contributions. However, others defended the project, noting that these tools were likely intended for the maintainers' own use or to assist willing contributors, not to encourage a flood of unvetted, automated PRs.

The conversation expanded to broader strategies for coping with the "slop" epidemic:
*   **Policy and Tools:** Users compared different project policies, such as Ghostty's requirement for AI contribution disclosure versus tldraw's total pause. There is skepticism that GitHub will provide effective filtering tools soon, with some suggesting that older, lower-friction methods like mailing lists were ironically better at filtering noise than modern issue trackers.
*   **Workflow Shifts:** One commenter suggested a shift in civic tech hackathons toward collaborating on specifications and regenerating code continuously, treating the code itself as disposable.
*   **The Human Element:** A counter-narrative highlighted that AI can be a force multiplier when used by skilled, thoughtful humans who engage with the community (citing a Ghostty user who used AI to find crashes). The consensus was that while expert use of AI is valuable, most automated submissions lack the critical thinking and context needed for inclusion.
*   **Economic and Social Impact:** The discussion touched on the difficulty juniors face in the job market and how the noise of AI contributions further blocks the traditional path of open-source contribution as a resume builder. Some maintainers expressed exhaustion, stating they have simply taken their projects private to avoid the hassle.

## [Cursor's latest "browser experiment" implied success without evidence](https://embedding-shapes.github.io/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/)
**Score:** 154 | **Comments:** 70 | **ID:** 46646777

> **Article:** The linked article, titled "Cursor's latest 'browser experiment' implied success without evidence," critiques a recent project by the AI coding tool Cursor. The author argues that Cursor's blog post and social media announcements created the impression of a successful, functional web browser built by AI agents, but provided no evidence that the code actually compiles or runs. The article points out that while the project generated thousands of commits and millions of lines of code, the underlying repository is non-functional and fails to compile. It highlights the discrepancy between the marketing claims (e.g., "built a browser from scratch") and the reality of the codebase, which relies heavily on existing libraries and is riddled with errors.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of Cursor's claims, with many commenters expressing skepticism and disappointment. A key point of contention is the lack of verifiable proof that the browser project works. One user, "embedding-shape," ran `cargo check` on the last 100 commits of the project's repository and found that every single one failed to compile, confirming the non-functional state of the code.

Commenters dissected the misleading nature of Cursor's marketing. They noted that while the blog post was carefully worded, public statements from Cursor's CEO on social media made bold, unverified claims about building a functional browser with a custom JavaScript engine and rendering engine. Further analysis revealed that the project was not built "from scratch" but was heavily dependent on existing Rust libraries like Servo (for HTML parsing and CSS) and others, making the "from scratch" claim misleading.

The discussion broadened into a critique of the current AI hype cycle. Many felt that such unsubstantiated claims contribute to unrealistic expectations and undermine the credibility of AI tools. Several commenters contrasted this with more established tools like Codex or Claude Code, which are presented as more transparent and verifiable. The conversation also touched on the ethics of marketing, with some arguing that the project was more of a "headline bait" experiment to generate hype rather than a genuine engineering achievement. The overall sentiment was one of frustration with the lack of transparency and the tendency to overhype AI capabilities without providing concrete evidence.

## [On Being a Human Being in the Time of Collapse (2022) [pdf]](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/crisis/crisis.pdf)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46644962

> **Article:** The article is a transcript of a lecture by Phillip Rogaway, a computer science professor, delivered to engineering students. It argues that humanity is facing a period of civilizational and environmental collapse, driven by human activity and enabled by technological and economic systems. Rogaway critiques the neutrality of engineers and scientists, suggesting that by focusing on technical problems without considering ethical implications, they often accelerate the very crises they might wish to solve. He calls for a rejection of nihilism and despair, urging his audience to actively "help" by refusing to work on harmful technologies (like surveillance or fossil fuel extraction), pushing back against unethical practices within institutions, and redirecting their skills toward public-interest work. The lecture is framed as a moral and existential call to action for those in technical fields.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide in reaction to the lecture's themes, centering on the role of academia, the mindset of engineers, and the nature of societal crises.

A primary point of contention is the appropriateness of such a lecture in an academic setting. Some commenters argue that universities should be a space for this kind of "messy" and philosophical reflection, especially in technically-focused disciplines like engineering that often lack a humanities component. This view holds that higher education's purpose is to optimize for a healthy society, not just individual job readiness. Conversely, others find the lecture's pessimistic tone to be "nihilistic garbage" and inappropriate for an educational environment, expressing concern that it could instill a defeatist attitude in students rather than fostering agency and problem-solving.

The discussion also highlights a clash between two distinct mindsets. Several commenters, identifying as engineers, express a strong instinct to solve problems rather than simply lament them. They view the lecture's focus on despair as unproductive, arguing that human history is a story of overcoming crises and that technical innovation will continue to delay any "apocalypse." This contrasts sharply with commenters who resonate with the lecture's call for moral endurance and a rejection of comfortable neutrality. They argue that technical skill is abundant but the will to make difficult, costly choices for the greater good is scarce, and that the lecture is a necessary wake-up call.

Finally, the conversation broadens to address the specific societal crises mentioned in the lecture. One thread explores the vulnerability of modern democracies to propaganda and the difficulty of making informed decisions on complex issues like climate change. Another commenter reframes these issues not as a failure of information but as a result of tangible, unaddressed physical problems like housing shortages and aging infrastructure, which create the societal pressure that makes people susceptible to manipulation. The discussion concludes with personal reflections from tech workers who, after grappling with the ethical implications of their industry, have chosen to pivot their careers toward more socially beneficial work, echoing the lecture's central message.

## [America could have $4 lunch bowls like Japan but for zoning laws](https://abio.substack.com/p/america-could-have-4-lunch-bowls)
**Score:** 149 | **Comments:** 261 | **ID:** 46646970

> **Article:** The article argues that the United States could have affordable, quick-service lunch options like Japan's $4 bowls, but is prevented by restrictive zoning and land-use regulations. It uses Japan's "kombini" (convenience store) bento boxes and dense, mixed-use urban environments as a model for what is possible. The author contends that American regulations—such as minimum parking requirements, single-use zoning, and complex permitting—create high overhead costs and barriers to entry for small businesses, which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. The piece suggests that these "death by a thousand cuts" regulations stifle the kind of small-scale, high-efficiency food service that is common in Japan.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a complex and multi-faceted debate about the root causes of high food and business costs in the US, with zoning laws serving as the central, but not universally accepted, culprit.

A significant portion of the commenters strongly agree with the article's premise, identifying a collective failure to reason about systemic effects. They argue that individually "reasonable" regulations (like parking minimums or health codes) combine to create an insurmountable barrier for small businesses. This is framed as a social and ideological problem where the public rabidly defends individual rules without seeing their cumulative negative impact. This group often points to the influence of money and lobbying, noting that small business owners lack the resources to fight for regulatory changes.

However, several counterarguments challenge this focus on zoning:
*   **Economic Reality:** Some argue that low prices are fundamentally tied to low labor costs. Japan's affordable food is linked to its lower median income and wages, and running such a business in the US would require exploiting labor in a way that is not feasible or desirable. Others point to high commercial rents, which they argue are a more direct barrier than zoning itself.
*   **International Comparisons:** Commenters note that the US is not unique; other developed countries with strict zoning (like in Europe) also lack $4 lunch bowls, suggesting the issue is broader than just American zoning codes. Houston, a major US city with no zoning, is also cited as lacking cheap lunch bowls, though a rebuttal claims it has "zoning-adjacent" regulations that serve the same purpose.
*   **Practicality and Nuance:** The discussion includes real-world examples of how regulations backfire. One commenter shared a personal story of being unable to buy a building due to insufficient parking and handicap spots, which ironically resulted in a less accessible final location. Another planning commissioner provided a detailed account of the political apathy and "rose-tinted" nostalgia that make local zoning reform incredibly difficult, highlighting a lack of public engagement as a key obstacle.

Finally, some comments question the article's factual basis (e.g., using a photo of Koreatown to illustrate a point about Japan) and propose alternative business models like "ghost kitchens" to circumvent high costs, though others note that delivery apps and the nature of these kitchens often undermine the low-cost, small-business ideal.

## [My Gripes with Prolog](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/my-gripes-with-prolog/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46641348

> **Article:** The article "My Gripes with Prolog" by Hillel Wayne outlines several practical frustrations with the Prolog programming language. The author's main complaints are:
1.  **Lack of Standardization**: Core features, particularly string handling, vary significantly between Prolog implementations (e.g., SWI-Prolog vs. Scryer Prolog), making code non-portable.
2.  **Execution Order Dependency**: Despite its declarative appearance, Prolog's execution is tied to the order of rules and facts, requiring programmers to think procedurally to write efficient and correct programs.
3.  **Counter-intuitive Semantics**: The author finds the semantics of certain operators, like the negation-as-failure operator (`\+`), to be confusing and unintuitive, especially when dealing with unbound variables.
4.  **Syntax**: The article notes that Prolog's syntax, rooted in formal logic, can be a barrier to adoption for those accustomed to more conventional programming languages.
The author concludes that while the ideas behind logic programming are powerful, the practical experience of using Prolog is often frustrating due to these issues.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was polarized, with many commenters defending Prolog while others shared the author's frustrations. The key themes were a debate over the validity of the author's criticisms and a broader conversation about the usability and ecosystem of logic programming languages.

A significant portion of the discussion involved a strong defense of Prolog, with several commenters accusing the author of misunderstanding the language's fundamentals. They argued that the author's complaints stemmed from a lack of deep knowledge, citing concepts like the "cut" operator (`!`) and negation-as-failure (`\+`). These defenders contended that these features are logical control structures, not mere optimizations, and that their behavior is consistent once one understands the underlying logic programming paradigm. This sentiment was encapsulated in comments like, "Here are my gripes about Prolog, a language that I don't understand."

Conversely, other commenters supported the author's points, particularly regarding the lack of standardization and the difficulty of the execution model. They shared personal anecdotes of being drawn to Prolog's ideas but failing in practice, especially with execution. The author's identity as an experienced developer was brought up to counter the "impatient newbie" accusations, lending weight to the idea that these are genuine usability issues, not just beginner frustrations.

The discussion also branched into related topics and solutions:
*   **Alternative Languages**: Commenters suggested alternatives like Datalog for specific use cases and Picat as a more modern, integrated language, though the latter was cautioned to be a "research language."
*   **Integration with Mainstream Languages**: The idea of embedding logic programming into languages like Python was raised, with miniKanren presented as a real-world implementation of this concept.
*   **Learning Resources**: Several users recommended classic Prolog textbooks like "The Art of Prolog" and online resources like "The Power of Prolog" to gain a proper understanding of the language.
*   **Practical Examples**: A link to a tiling window manager written in Prolog was shared to demonstrate that the language is capable of building practical, complex applications.

## [All 23-Bit Still Lifes Are Glider Constructible](https://mvr.github.io/posts/xs23.html)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 13 | **ID:** 46641239

> **Article:** The article presents a mathematical proof that all 23-bit still lifes (stable patterns) in Conway's Game of Life are constructible using gliders. It focuses on a specific 23-bit pattern that was the last remaining "holdout" in a search for glider-constructible still lifes, providing the construction steps to prove its constructibility. The work is a contribution to the ongoing exploration of the Game of Life's capabilities, specifically in the domain of pattern construction.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion highlights the surprising depth of open problems remaining in Conway's Game of Life, with commenters expressing surprise that human intuition still plays a role rather than problems being solved by brute force. The conversation quickly pivots to theoretical computer science, with users comparing the problem to the Busy Beaver function and questioning whether determining if a still life is glider-constructible is an undecidable problem. One user notes that while the "inverse" problem (predicting the outcome of a glider construction) is undecidable due to Turing completeness, the constructibility problem itself remains an open question.

The discussion also explores creative applications and variations of cellular automata. Several users express a long-standing desire for a reversible version of the Game of Life, with one proposing a two-player game concept where players modify the timeline by introducing gliders. Another commenter connects the topic to other computational frontiers, mentioning Rule 54—a 1D cellular automaton conjectured to be Turing complete—and suggesting that such proofs may soon be found by neuro-symbolic AI systems. Finally, a user proposes naming the 23-bit holdout pattern "spectacles" due to its visual appearance, drawing a parallel to the recent "spectre" aperiodic monotile discovery.

## [Why DuckDB is my first choice for data processing](https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_duckdb/)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 47 | **ID:** 46645176

> **Article:** The article argues that DuckDB should be the default choice for data processing tasks, particularly for datasets that fit on a single machine (under 10GB). The author highlights its speed, ease of use, and flexibility, positioning it as a "Swiss Army knife" for analytical work. Key features praised include its ability to directly query various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet), its columnar storage performance, and its potential as a simpler alternative to complex distributed systems like Spark or lakehouse formats (Iceberg/Delta Lake) for medium-scale data. The author acknowledges that while dataframe libraries like Polars are excellent, DuckDB's SQL interface offers better long-term stability and ecosystem standardization.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion largely validates the article's enthusiasm for DuckDB, with users praising its flexibility and performance across various data sources, including S3, Excel, and pandas dataframes. A major point of agreement is the utility of using SQL to query files directly, which simplifies workflows that might otherwise require complex scripting. Users also highlighted specific features like `glob` patterns for reading multiple files and `union_by_name` for handling schema variations.

Technical capabilities were a key topic. Several users confirmed that DuckDB handles large tables (100M+ rows) efficiently, noting that automatic features like zonemaps mitigate concerns about full scans on unindexed data. The discussion also touched on DuckDB's ecosystem, specifically the newer "DuckLake" project for metadata management, which some users are successfully using with cloud storage, though it is noted as less mature than established formats like Iceberg.

However, there was some debate regarding the article's broader claims. One user challenged the idea that the "era of clusters is ending," arguing that datasets can quickly outgrow memory even on large machines and that SQL is not always the best tool for complex data augmentation compared to Python/Polars. The author responded by clarifying that their stance is pragmatic: DuckDB is often sufficient for the majority of tabular data (which is typically under 10GB) and avoids the overhead of distributed systems, though it is not a universal solution. Finally, users expressed interest in DuckDB's potential for embedded analytics, particularly via WebAssembly, though some noted the binary size remains a consideration for web deployment.

## [European troops arrive in Greenland to boost the Arctic island's security](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/15/g-s1-106113/european-troops-arrive-greenland)
**Score:** 107 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46639401

> **Article:** The article reports that European troops, specifically small contingents from France and Germany, have arrived in Greenland for military exercises aimed at boosting the Arctic island's security. This deployment is framed as a response to growing strategic competition in the region and comes amid a "fundamental disagreement" between the Trump administration and its European allies over security priorities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is dominated by the interpretation of this troop deployment as a direct response to perceived aggression from the United States under the Trump administration, rather than a move against Russia or China. Many commenters view this as a sign of a fracturing NATO alliance, with some expressing alarm that the relationship with the US is effectively over and that war is a possibility. A central theme is that the deployment is a political maneuver to either compel the US to take Arctic security seriously or, more cynically, to deliberately undermine and erode trust within NATO. The small size of the European contingents is noted, with some dismissing them as militarily insignificant but politically symbolic, while others argue they would be ineffective as a "tripwire" force.

Commenters also debate the motivations behind US interest in Greenland, with theories ranging from a strategic play to split NATO, to a desire for rare minerals, to simple distraction from domestic issues. The historical context of US military presence in Greenland is raised to question the narrative of European forces "protecting" the island from the US. The discussion also touches on broader geopolitical anxieties, including the potential for the US to target Canada next and the long-term damage to transatlantic trust, with one user wryly noting the historical irony of German troops being positioned against the US.
