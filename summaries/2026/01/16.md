## [STFU](https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/stfu)
**Score:** 478 | **Comments:** 354 | **ID:** 46649142

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub repository for a project named "STFU," which is a mobile application designed to silence loud speakers in public places. The app uses a technique called Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF), where it captures ambient sound via the phone's microphone and plays it back to the speaker with a delay (the repository mentions a 2-second delay). The theory is that hearing one's own voice with a lag disrupts the brain's speech processing, making it difficult to continue speaking, thus encouraging the person to stop or lower their volume.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around the technical basis, social implications, and personal anecdotes related to the "STFU" app and the concept of Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF).

**Technical Context and Efficacy**
Several users identified the core mechanism as DAF, a known phenomenon. Commenters shared that even short delays (a few hundred milliseconds) are highly disruptive to speech, though one user questioned if the app's 2-second delay is too long to be effective. Anecdotes from VR developers and older cell phone users confirmed that hearing one's own voice with a lag is disorienting and infuriating. The conversation also branched into related "audio disruption" technologies, such as "TV-B-Gone" remote controls, which users shared stories about using to mute public televisions.

**Social and Ethical Debate**
A significant portion of the debate focused on the morality of using such an app.
*   **Pro-App:** Users argued that loud speakers in public spaces (like airports) are anti-social and that the app provides a non-confrontational way to enforce courtesy. One user noted that asking people to quiet down usually works, but the app removes the need for direct interaction.
*   **Anti-App:** Critics argued that the app is malicious and that two wrongs don't make a right—using a disruptive tool doesn't solve the underlying lack of social awareness. Some felt that society is becoming too intolerant of noise and that public spaces inherently involve some level of disturbance.
*   **Courage vs. Confrontation:** Users debated whether speaking up requires "courage." One side felt it was simply asserting social norms, while the other felt the app was for those too timid to address the issue directly.

**Practical Limitations**
Users pointed out practical flaws in the concept. One commenter noted that loud people in public often lack the self-awareness or concern for others to be bothered by the DAF effect. Another user, a musician, highlighted that any audio latency makes it impossible to perform, suggesting the app might be effective but highlights the difficulty of real-time audio processing in general.

## [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com/)
**Score:** 441 | **Comments:** 224 | **ID:** 46645615

> **Article:** The article introduces "Just the Browser," a project that provides scripts to configure Firefox and Chrome to be more minimal and privacy-focused. The primary goal is to remove modern "bloat" such as AI features (like Copilot), shopping integrations, and telemetry. It offers manual configuration steps and downloadable scripts for Windows and Linux to apply these changes, aiming to return the browser to a simpler, more traditional web experience.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the project's methods while broadly agreeing with its philosophy of removing browser bloat. The main points of contention are security and implementation.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the security risks of the project's recommended installation method: running a shell script downloaded via `curl | bash` with `sudo` privileges. Commenters argue this is a dangerous practice, especially given the prevalence of supply chain attacks, and that requiring root access for a simple user configuration file is unnecessary and poorly designed. The project's creator responded that `sudo` is needed for protected system directories and that manual installation instructions are provided for those who don't trust the script.

Beyond the security concerns, users expressed a strong desire for simplicity and consistency in their web experience, contrasting it with what they see as excessive and often counterproductive "innovation" in modern UI/UX. There was also skepticism about the project's scope, with some noting that the scripts only change a few flags and that similar results could be achieved through manual configuration. The discussion also touched on broader topics, such as the perceived stagnation of Firefox, the enshittification of major browsers (with a notable absence of discussion about Safari), and a general sentiment that the "golden age" of UI/UX innovation is over.

## [OpenBSD-current now runs as guest under Apple Hypervisor](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20260115203619)
**Score:** 389 | **Comments:** 54 | **ID:** 46642560

> **Article:** The article from undeadly.org announces that OpenBSD-current (the development version) can now run as a guest operating system under Apple's native Virtualization.framework on Apple Silicon. This marks a significant step in bringing native virtualization support to OpenBSD on Mac hardware, distinct from previous work with Hypervisor.framework and QEMU.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion was largely positive, with commenters highlighting several key implications and technical details. A primary point of clarification was the distinction between Apple's Virtualization.framework and the previously supported Hypervisor.framework, with users noting the confusing naming conventions.

The most significant practical benefit mentioned was the resolution of a long-standing bug in QEMU that caused OpenBSD to hang when starting the X Window System on arm64. This fix is a major quality-of-life improvement for users, particularly those with only Apple Silicon hardware, who want a graphical desktop environment in their OpenBSD VM.

Technical hurdles were also discussed. One user pointed out that networking was still a limitation, but others countered that OpenBSD is heavily command-line oriented. A deeper technical point was raised about the negotiation of `VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU`, which required explicit patching in OpenBSD to handle Apple's hypervisor implementation. Commenters also expressed hope that this progress would extend to other operating systems, like FreeBSD.

Security was another topic. While some questioned the isolation of a guest OS under a host, it was noted that OpenBSD is developing support for confidential computing technologies like AMD SEV, which can provide stronger hardware-level isolation on supported systems.

Overall, the community viewed this as a significant milestone for OpenBSD on Apple hardware, making local development and testing much smoother.

## [Canada slashes 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs to 6%](https://electrek.co/2026/01/16/canada-breaks-with-us-slashes-100-tariffs-chinese-evs/)
**Score:** 361 | **Comments:** 448 | **ID:** 46648778

> **Article:** Canada has announced a significant shift in its trade policy by reducing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) from 100% to 6%. This change is not a blanket reduction; it applies to an initial quota of 49,000 vehicles priced at approximately CAD 35,000 or less, with the cap set to increase to 70,000 over five years. This move signals a strategic diversification of Canada's economy, particularly as it seeks to establish itself as a distinct economic entity amidst growing friction with traditional partners like the United States.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, blending political commentary, economic analysis, and consumer sentiment. A prominent thread of conversation is highly critical of the Trump administration, with one highly-upvoted comment framing the policy as a "resounding success" for US adversaries. This sparked a debate about the specific geopolitical motivations behind the tariff change, with users questioning which adversary would benefit from lower-priced EVs in Canada.

Economically, users are analyzing the scale of the policy. The quota of 49,000 vehicles is contextualized against Canada's total annual car sales (2 million) and recent EV registration data (45,366 in Q3 2025), leading to the conclusion that while the change is significant for Canada, its global economic impact is limited. The policy is seen as a strategic message about Canadian economic independence rather than a massive market disruption.

The impact on the North American automotive market, particularly Tesla, is a major point of speculation. Some users believe this will force Tesla to innovate and produce more affordable EVs to compete, while others are skeptical, citing Elon Musk's unpredictable decision-making. There is a strong consensus that Chinese EV manufacturers are already technologically superior to many Western counterparts, with users citing brands like Zeekr, Xpeng, and Denza as examples of more advanced vehicles. The discussion also touches on security concerns, with parallels drawn to the banning of Chinese drones and EVs from sensitive sites in the UK, suggesting that data privacy and surveillance will be significant hurdles for Chinese automakers entering Western markets.

## [List of individual trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_individual_trees)
**Score:** 335 | **Comments:** 111 | **ID:** 46641284

> **Article:** The Wikipedia article "List of individual trees" is a curated catalog of trees that are notable for reasons beyond their species, such as historical significance, unusual characteristics, or cultural impact. It functions as a directory to specific, named trees rather than a general botanical classification. The list includes a wide variety of examples, from ancient trees like the Methuselah Pine to trees with unique physical traits, such as the "Bicycle Tree" in Scotland which has grown around a bicycle. The article highlights Wikipedia's unique role in documenting obscure but culturally significant records that would not typically appear in traditional encyclopedias.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to the article with a mix of appreciation, humor, and curiosity. The primary sentiment was positive, with users valuing the collection of unique records and the "personality" of individual trees. Several distinct themes emerged in the discussion:

*   **Humor and Quirky Examples:** Commenters were particularly amused by the more unusual entries, most notably a tree in London's Hampstead Heath known as the "Fuck Tree" for its role in gay cruising. Users debated whether this was a joke or a legitimate, well-documented fact.
*   **Personal Anecdotes and Shared Experiences:** The post prompted users to share their own experiences with notable trees. One user recounted visiting the Ancient Bristlecone Pine forest (home to the 4,855-year-old Methuselah tree), while another discussed the UK's Sycamore Gap tree, a famous landscape feature that was illegally felled in 2023, sparking national outrage and jail sentences for the perpetrators.
*   **Curiosity and Further Exploration:** The discussion spurred requests for related content and further investigation. Users shared links to similar lists (like "List of superlative trees") and debated the mechanics of trees growing around objects, such as a childhood memory of gravestones caught in a tree's boughs. There was also a lighthearted reference to Monty Python's "How to Recognise Different Types of Trees from Quite a Long Way Away."
*   **Critique and Limitations:** Some users noted the list's incomprehensiveness, acknowledging that many notable trees will never have a Wikipedia article. Others pointed out omissions, such as the Adyar Banyan tree in India, prompting further sharing of information.

## [6-Day and IP Address Certificates Are Generally Available](https://letsencrypt.org/2026/01/15/6day-and-ip-general-availability)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 172 | **ID:** 46647491

> **Article:** Let's Encrypt has announced the general availability of 6-day and IP address certificates. The 6-day certificates are designed for ephemeral services, while IP address certificates allow TLS for public IP addresses without requiring a domain name. Both are intended for automated renewal workflows and are not suitable for manual management.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily focused on the practical implementation of these new certificate types, the implications of the 6-day lifespan, and the use cases for IP address certificates.

A major theme was the readiness of ACME clients. Users noted that while clients like `acme.sh`, `lego`, and `caddy` support IP address certificates, `certbot` does not yet support them, though a pull request is open. Several users provided workarounds using `lego` for those wanting to test the feature immediately.

The 6-day certificate lifespan sparked significant debate. Some users expressed concern that the extremely short renewal window leaves little room for error or debugging, potentially increasing operational risk. Others argued that this is only viable for fully automated environments and that commercial certificates might be better for less mature setups. Conversely, proponents highlighted the utility of short-lived certificates for ephemeral, non-human-facing services, as it removes dependencies on DNS provisioning.

Regarding IP address certificates, the community identified the primary use case as ephemeral cloud services where DNS setup is impractical. However, it was clarified that these certificates only work for publicly routable IP addresses, meaning they cannot be used to secure local network (LAN) devices or localhost development without workarounds. A private Certificate Authority (CA) was suggested as the solution for internal network security.

Finally, the discussion touched on future possibilities, including support for `.onion` addresses, with users noting that the trust model for Tor hidden services is already robust due to the nature of the network.

## [Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, NTSB report says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly56w0p9e1o)
**Score:** 274 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 46642920

> **Article:** A new NTSB report reveals that Boeing was aware of a flaw in a part linked to a 2013 UPS plane crash in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed two pilots. The report indicates that Boeing had issued a service bulletin in 2011 regarding the slat track component, but it was classified as non-critical, stating it "would not result in a safety of flight condition." The crash involved a 22-year-old Boeing 747-400, and investigators are examining whether the part's failure was due to fatigue or insufficient maintenance, highlighting ongoing concerns about Boeing's risk assessment and transparency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion surrounding the article focuses on several key themes, primarily centering on Boeing's accountability and the complexities of aircraft maintenance. Many commenters express frustration with Boeing's history of downplaying known flaws, drawing parallels to the 737 MAX MCAS controversy where pilot nationality was unfairly blamed. There is significant debate over the adequacy of inspection intervals for aging aircraft; while some note that comprehensive "D checks" involve extensive disassembly, others question if visual inspections are sufficient for detecting metal fatigue in hard-to-reach components. The conversation also touches on the broader issue of corporate risk management, with users distinguishing between unavoidable engineering flaws and the unethical calculation of accepting fatalities as a cost of doing business. Finally, some commenters contextualize the incident by comparing it to historical aviation accidents like the DC-10 crash and expressing concern over the safety of current high-profile Boeing projects like the Artemis mission.

## [Cursor's latest “browser experiment” implied success without evidence](https://embedding-shapes.github.io/cursor-implied-success-without-evidence/)
**Score:** 267 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 46646777

> **Article:** The article critiques a recent blog post by Cursor, an AI-assisted coding tool, which claimed to have built a functional web browser using thousands of AI agents. The author argues that this claim is misleading and unsupported by evidence. The post points out that the project's GitHub repository contains code that fails to compile, relies heavily on existing libraries (like Servo) rather than being built "from scratch," and lacks any verifiable proof of a working product. The author concludes that the announcement was primarily a marketing stunt designed to generate hype around AI capabilities without substantive results.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Cursor's claims, with commenters expressing skepticism and disappointment over what they perceive as misleading marketing. The central theme is the lack of evidence for a working product. One user, embedding-shape, empirically tested the last 100 commits of the project's repository and found that none of them compiled successfully, a finding that was widely cited in the discussion. This technical failure fueled accusations that the screenshots in the original blog post were either faked or created in a non-reproducible manner.

Commenters also dissected the technical claims, noting that the "from-scratch" browser was heavily dependent on existing open-source projects like Servo for core functionalities such as HTML parsing and CSS. This was seen as exaggerating the role of AI and downplaying the use of human-built libraries. The discussion extended to the broader context of AI hype, with many users arguing that such unsubstantiated claims damage the credibility of the field and make it harder for developers to have discerning conversations about the actual utility and limitations of AI tools. The CEO's public statements, particularly on Twitter, were highlighted as being more overtly promotional than the blog post itself, contributing to the perception of a hype-driven narrative rather than a genuine technical achievement.

## [Michelangelo's first painting, created when he was 12 or 13](https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/discover-michelangelos-first-painting.html)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46646263

> **Article:** The article from Open Culture discusses a painting attributed to Michelangelo, created when he was approximately 12 or 13 years old. The work, titled "The Torment of Saint Anthony," depicts demons attacking the saint and is notable for being the only Michelangelo painting in the Americas and one of only four easel paintings attributed to him. The article frames this as his first known painting, highlighting the prodigious talent of the young artist.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on clarifying the context and nature of the painting rather than just celebrating the artwork. Several commenters quickly corrected the premise that this was Michelangelo's "first painting," arguing it was merely his earliest *surviving* known work. They emphasized that any artist capable of this level of detail would have had years of prior practice and sketching, dismissing the "overnight genius" narrative.

A significant portion of the debate focused on the painting's originality. Users pointed out that the work is not an original composition but a painted copy of an engraving by Martin Schongauer. This led to a discussion on whether attributing the work to Michelangelo is definitive, with some skepticism raised about the provenance and the incentives of museums to authenticate high-value artifacts.

Other threads of discussion included:
*   **Historical Context:** Users debated whether modern distractions like electronics reduce artistic output, concluding that historical artistic genius was rare regardless of technology.
*   **Personal Anecdotes:** A user shared a coincidence of having just visited the Kimbell Art Museum to see the painting in person.
*   **Artistic Interpretation:** One commenter drew a parallel between the painting and comic book art, viewing the Bible through the lens of a superhero narrative for the young artist, while others corrected historical facts regarding Michelangelo's disdain for painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

## [Why senior engineers let bad projects fail](https://lalitm.com/post/why-senior-engineers-let-bad-projects-fail/)
**Score:** 254 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 46640366

> **Article:** The article "Why senior engineers let bad projects fail" argues that experienced engineers should strategically choose when to intervene in projects they believe are doomed. The author contends that constantly fighting against bad ideas is politically costly and emotionally draining. Instead of being a perpetual naysayer, a senior engineer should save their political capital for critical moments. The article suggests that allowing a project to fail can be a valuable learning experience for the team and organization, and it is often more effective than trying to force a change on an unwilling group. The core message is to focus energy on battles that are both winnable and crucial to the company's success, and to let other failures run their course.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a significant tension between professional pragmatism and ethical responsibility. A central theme is the debate over an engineer's duty to the organization versus self-preservation. One camp argues that employment is a business transaction, and engineers, especially those without political power, should not carry the emotional burden of a company's poor decisions. This view holds that letting projects fail is a valid, self-serving strategy to avoid being associated with failure and to conserve energy for more promising initiatives.

In direct opposition, others argue that this approach is amoral and harmful to the organization and its people. They contend that it is an engineer's ethical duty to speak up and prevent waste of resources and colleagues' time, even at personal risk. A more nuanced, and widely supported, middle ground emerged. This perspective suggests a strategic approach: senior engineers should voice concerns and offer alternative solutions, but they must learn to "pick their battles." Once it's clear that leadership is committed to a failing path, the engineer should disengage emotionally and avoid arguing further, having fulfilled their duty to warn. This balance is seen as a mark of true seniority—knowing when to speak up and when to save one's political capital and energy for what truly matters.

## [Interactive eBPF](https://ebpf.party/)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 8 | **ID:** 46644181

> **Article:** The article links to "ebpf.party," an interactive learning platform for eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter). The site provides hands-on exercises designed to help users understand and practice eBPF programming directly in the browser, lowering the barrier to entry for this complex kernel technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response to the platform was overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing gratitude to the creator ("deivid") and enthusiasm for having a hands-on way to learn eBPF. Several commenters noted that they had been wanting to get into eBPF but found the initial setup difficult, making this tool particularly valuable.

Beyond the initial praise, the discussion touched on two main themes:
1.  **Educational Expansion:** Users suggested adding lessons on practical deployment topics, specifically the differences between using libbcc and CO-RE (Compile Once – Run Everywhere). There was also a request for a book or PDF compilation of the exercises and source code.
2.  **Security Concerns:** One user raised a critical question about eBPF's security, noting that its innovative capabilities make it a significant attack surface and a potential tool for rootkit developers. The response clarified that modern systems require the `cap_bpf` capability to load programs, which acts as a security boundary.

## [Tldraw pauses external contributions due to AI slop](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46641042

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue from the tldraw project announcing a temporary pause on external contributions. The decision was made due to a high volume of low-quality, AI-generated pull requests ("AI slop") that are time-consuming for maintainers to review and reject. The project states that while they support AI-assisted development, the current influx of unvetted, automated submissions is unsustainable and they are exploring better ways to manage contributions in the future.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates tldraw's decision, framing it as a symptom of a broader trend where the bottleneck in open-source development is shifting from code creation to code review. A key theme is the resulting maintainer burnout, as reviewing "slop" is far less engaging than writing code and is often done by volunteers who are already in precarious positions. This has led to a sense of pessimism, with some commenters predicting more projects will close contributions or move to more private models.

The conversation explores several potential solutions and reactions. Some suggest a fundamental shift in workflow, such as collaborating on specifications and regenerating code continuously, treating it more like a CI process. Others point to the "GitHub culture" as part of the problem, arguing that the platform's prominent display of open PRs creates an implicit commitment from maintainers that doesn't exist in older, mailing-list-based workflows. A contrasting viewpoint, highlighted by a quote from Ghostty's Mitchell Hashimoto, suggests that AI can be a powerful tool for high-quality contributions when used by skilled and thoughtful individuals who engage with the community. However, the consensus is that such cases are rare, and the current reality is an overwhelming tide of low-effort spam that is forcing projects to lock down.

## [Why DuckDB is my first choice for data processing](https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_duckdb/)
**Score:** 163 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 46645176

> **Article:** The article argues that DuckDB should be the default choice for most data processing tasks. The author contends that modern hardware is powerful enough to process the vast majority of tabular datasets (under 10GB) on a single machine, making complex distributed systems like Spark unnecessary for many use cases. DuckDB is presented as a lightweight, high-performance, and flexible "Swiss Army knife" that excels at querying various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet) directly with SQL. It is also highlighted as a powerful tool for embedding analytics into applications, especially with its WebAssembly (WASM) version. The author acknowledges that DuckDB isn't a complete replacement for lakehouse formats like Iceberg but points to its new "DuckLake" extension as a promising, simpler alternative for smaller-scale data lakes.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly positive, with users echoing the article's themes of flexibility, performance, and ease of use. Key points of agreement include:

*   **Ease of Use for Common Tasks:** Multiple users praised DuckDB's ability to run SQL queries directly on local files like CSV and JSON, calling it "pretty sweet" and a significant improvement over traditional command-line tools like `awk` for more complex joins and aggregations.
*   **Flexibility and Performance:** Commenters highlighted DuckDB's versatility in connecting to a wide range of data sources, including S3, various databases, and even Pandas dataframes. Its performance on large datasets (e.g., 100M+ rows) on a single machine was confirmed, with one user noting that features like automatic "zonemaps" make full scans highly efficient.
*   **Embedding and WebAssembly:** The small footprint and WASM support were identified as game-changers for embedding analytics directly into applications and creating powerful in-browser data tools, with the marimo notebook mentioned as a prime example.
*   **Debate on Scale and SQL vs. Code:** A central point of debate emerged around the article's claim that the "era of clusters is coming to an end." A skeptical user argued this is debatable, as datasets can quickly outgrow a single machine's memory, and that complex data augmentation often requires the expressiveness of code (like Python/Polars) over SQL. The author responded by clarifying their position: DuckDB is an excellent *starting point* for the majority of datasets under 10GB, and the lack of standardization in dataframe APIs makes SQL a more future-proof choice.
*   **Specific Use Cases and Comparisons:** Users discussed practical applications, such as querying billions of records for transactional data (where DuckDB was expected to perform well) and comparing DuckDB's lakehouse solution (DuckLake) to more mature options like Iceberg (with DuckLake seen as simpler for smaller applications). There was also a brief mention of existing Java APIs, correcting a misconception in the comments.

## [On Being a Human Being in the Time of Collapse (2022) [pdf]](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/crisis/crisis.pdf)
**Score:** 155 | **Comments:** 143 | **ID:** 46644962

> **Article:** The article "On Being a Human Being in the Time of Collapse" is a lecture transcript by computer science professor Phillip Rogaway. It argues that humanity is facing a severe, multi-faceted crisis driven by human activity, particularly climate change and the erosion of democracy. Rogaway critiques the field of computer science for being too focused on technical problems ("the how") while ignoring the broader societal and ethical consequences ("the why"). He calls on computer scientists to reject neutrality, refuse to work on harmful technologies (like surveillance or weapons), and actively engage in political and social efforts to mitigate collapse. The lecture is framed as a personal reflection and a plea for moral responsibility within the tech community.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a deep divide in reactions to the article's pessimistic tone and its call to action. The conversation centers on the role of education, the mindset of engineers, and the feasibility of individual action in the face of systemic crises.

A significant portion of the debate focuses on the appropriateness of such a lecture in an academic setting, particularly for engineering students. Some commenters felt the lecture's "defeatist attitude" was inappropriate for a classroom, arguing that education should foster optimism and problem-solving rather than "nihilistic garbage." Others defended it, asserting that a core purpose of college is to expose students to difficult, "messy ideas" and encourage reflection beyond mere job training. They argued that engineering education, in particular, often lacks a humanities component that addresses the "why" behind the "what" and "how."

The discussion also explored the engineer's mindset. One commenter contrasted the tendency to simply acknowledge problems with the engineer's instinct to solve them, suggesting that technical innovation will ultimately delay any "apocalypse." This optimistic view was challenged by others who pointed to historical near-misses (like the Cuban Missile Crisis) and the lack of a guaranteed technological fix for all crises.

The theme of individual agency and ethical responsibility was prominent. Several commenters shared personal struggles with finding ethical work in the tech industry, with one stating it's "ethically almost impossible" to work for 99% of software companies. The conversation touched on the difficulty of "helping" without becoming a martyr and the importance of self-efficacy—finding satisfaction in concrete actions—as an antidote to nihilism. A recurring idea was that the current political and social vulnerability stems from a combination of targeted propaganda and real, unaddressed physical problems like housing shortages, which make people easier to manipulate.

Ultimately, the comments reflect a spectrum of responses, from outright rejection of the lecture's premise to deep agreement with its call for moral endurance. The debate encapsulates a broader cultural tension between technological optimism and a sense of impending crisis, questioning how individuals, especially those in powerful fields like software, should navigate their roles in a complex and troubled world.

## [My Gripes with Prolog](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/my-gripes-with-prolog/)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 46641348

> **Article:** The article "My Gripes with Prolog" by Hillel Wayne outlines several practical frustrations with the Prolog programming language. The author's main complaints are:
*   **Lack of Standardization:** Core features like strings and floating-point numbers vary significantly between Prolog implementations (e.g., SWI-Prolog vs. Scryer Prolog), hindering portability.
*   **Counter-intuitive Semantics:** The cut operator (`!`) is described as a necessary but dangerous optimization that can lead to invalid programs if used incorrectly. The negation operator (`\+`) is confusing, especially when applied to unbound variables, as it functions as "not provable" rather than simple boolean negation.
*   **Execution Order:** While Prolog appears declarative, the programmer must be aware of the execution order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to write correct and efficient code, which undermines the declarative promise.
*   **Syntax:** The author finds the syntax unpleasant and suggests that a more modern language could better integrate logic programming concepts.

The article concludes by mentioning the author's exploration of Picat, a successor language that addresses some of these issues, though it comes with its own caveats as a "research language."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is polarized, with commenters either defending Prolog's design or agreeing with the author's frustrations. Key themes include:

*   **Defense of Prolog's Paradigm:** Several users argue that the author misunderstands Prolog's foundations. They contend that Prolog's syntax is based on First-Order Logic, not traditional programming languages, and its operators like `cut` and `\+` have precise logical meanings ("pruning backtracking" and "not provable") that are not inherently flawed. The criticism that predicates "return" values was cited as a fundamental misunderstanding of logic programming.

*   **Agreement with Practical Criticisms:** Many commenters validated the author's complaints about practical, real-world issues. The lack of standardization, particularly for strings, was highlighted as a significant barrier. The difficulty of managing execution order and the unintuitive behavior of negation were also frequently mentioned pain points.

*   **Counter-Arguments and Resources:** A recurring counter-argument was that the author's "gripes" stem from inexperience and a failure to consult foundational texts like "The Art of Prolog" or "The Power of Prolog." Several users recommended learning resources and alternative systems like Datalog or miniKanren, which integrate logic programming into more familiar syntax.

*   **Personal Experiences:** Some users shared their own positive experiences with Prolog, pointing to practical applications like a window manager written in SWI-Prolog to demonstrate its viability. Others expressed a recurring desire to use Prolog for certain problems but ultimately failed due to its execution model.

Overall, the discussion centered on the tension between Prolog's elegant theoretical foundations and its often-unforgiving practical implementation, with debate over whether the author's frustrations are valid critiques or symptoms of a shallow understanding.

## [All 23-Bit Still Lifes Are Glider Constructible](https://mvr.github.io/posts/xs23.html)

> **Article:** The article announces a proof that all 23-bit still life patterns in Conway's Game of Life are constructible using gliders. A still life is a pattern that returns to its original state after one generation. The author provides a constructive proof for every possible 23-bit pattern, effectively closing a specific open problem in the field. The article also notes that there remains one unsolved 24-bit pattern, which the community has nicknamed "spectacles."
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted with enthusiasm to the niche mathematical problem, expressing surprise that human intuition remains relevant in a domain seemingly suited for brute-force computation. Commenters noted the sheer scale of the state space makes exhaustive search impossible, comparing the problem's complexity to the Busy Beaver problem.

A central theme of the discussion was the theoretical limits of computation within the Game of Life. One user asked whether the problem of determining if a pattern is glider-constructible is undecidable, leading to a technical exchange about Turing completeness. Another user lamented that the Game of Life is not reversible (unlike real-world physics), which sparked a creative proposal for a two-player game where players build stable configurations while launching gliders at each other, with the ability to reverse time to modify strategies.

The conversation also touched on the broader landscape of open mathematical problems, with one user citing Rule 54, a 1D cellular automaton conjectured to be Turing complete but not yet proven. That user predicted that such proofs will eventually be found by neuro-symbolic AI, citing recent advances in AI mathematics.

## [San Francisco to offer free childcare to people making up to $230k](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/san-francisco-childcare-families)

> **Article:** The Guardian article reports that San Francisco is launching a program to offer free childcare to families earning up to $230,000 annually. For families earning up to $310,000, a 50% subsidy will be available. The initiative aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare in the city, which is a significant barrier for many working parents. The program is framed as a way to support families and potentially boost workforce participation by making childcare more affordable.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the policy's economic incentives, implementation challenges, and comparisons to similar programs elsewhere.

A primary theme is the critique of income-based "cliffs" and phase-outs. Several users argue that creating a sharp cutoff (e.g., at $230k) creates perverse incentives, such as discouraging promotions, encouraging "pension stuffing" to lower taxable income (as seen in the UK), or causing a situation where earning slightly more results in a net loss of benefits. Commenters generally prefer a system with gradual phase-outs or universal benefits to avoid these issues.

The policy's impact on the workforce and family dynamics is debated. One user suggests the cap could inadvertently keep lower-earning parents (often mothers) out of the workforce, as it might not be financially viable for them to work if the family income slightly exceeds the threshold. Others counter that the high income cap still benefits a large portion of dual-income households in a high-cost-of-living area like San Francisco.

Practical implementation challenges are also raised. Commenters question the feasibility of providing childcare in a city with extremely high land and labor costs, wondering how staff could afford to live there and where facilities would be built. A recurring point is that San Francisco has a low child population, which some see as a result of past policy choices that the new program aims to reverse.

Finally, there is a discussion on funding and fairness. While some view the program as a necessary public good funded by taxpayers, others express skepticism about the tax base, noting that the wealthiest individuals may have left California. The conversation also touches on the definition of "lower class" in a city where the income threshold is $230,000, highlighting the unique economic context of the Bay Area.
