## [Ask HN: How can we solve the loneliness epidemic?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46635345)
**Score:** 679 | **Comments:** 1060 | **ID:** 46635345

> **Question:** The user "publicdebates" asks the Hacker News community for solutions to the loneliness epidemic. They share a personal anecdote about childhood trauma and social isolation, noting that negative self-perception makes it difficult to connect with others. They describe their own grassroots effort to combat loneliness by conducting public surveys in a city (e.g., holding signs asking "how alone do you feel") to initiate low-stakes interactions with strangers. They ask for new ideas to reach people who feel disconnected and unable to join local groups.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion explores the causes of loneliness and potential solutions, ranging from personal responsibility to systemic changes.

**Personal Agency and Grassroots Efforts**
Several users praised the original poster's survey initiative, viewing it as a creative way to break the ice with low-stakes interactions. Suggestions for similar approaches included playing music in public spaces, creating "physical social networks" based on geographic proximity (like a localized social app or scheduled meetups), and fostering a "pyramid structure" where people help others connect. One commenter emphasized the necessity of "intentionally choosing community" and putting in the effort to cultivate it, while another shared a personal story of finding community through local volunteering and mutual aid.

**Systemic and Generational Shifts**
A recurring theme is the loss of "third places" and mandatory public interaction. A self-identified "tail-end boomer" argued that past generations socialized more because daily activities (shopping, transit, libraries) required being in public, whereas modern convenience allows people to avoid interaction entirely. This view suggests that loneliness is a byproduct of an environment that makes isolation too easy. Others pointed to the decline of traditional community structures like churches or social lodges (e.g., Elks Club), questioning if a resurgence of such institutions is possible.

**Psychological Barriers**
Commenters discussed the internal hurdles to connection. The original poster described the difficulty of "pulling oneself up by the bootstraps" when dealing with deep-seated negative self-talk. A counterpoint argued that while society can be harsh, the responsibility ultimately lies with the individual to find their "voice" and engage with the "crowd," citing childhood experiences where resilience was forged through adversity. However, others noted that the "deep thinker" personality type often exacerbates isolation, and that simply telling someone to "get out there" is unhelpful without addressing underlying motivation or trauma.

**Skepticism and Nuance**
There was a debate over the severity of the "loneliness epidemic." One user cited statistics showing high personal life satisfaction and argued that community is easy to find if one tries. This was countered by others who pointed out that satisfaction ratings are at historic lows and that "satisfied" is a broad category that doesn't capture the depth of isolation. A悲观 perspective suggested that loneliness is an irreparable byproduct of broken societal systems, leaving some people "too far gone" to be helped by current social structures.

## [Briar keeps Iran connected via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when the internet goes dark](https://briarproject.org/manual/fa/)
**Score:** 478 | **Comments:** 293 | **ID:** 46638013

> **Article:** The article links to the official manual for Briar, a peer-to-peer messaging application designed to function without internet access. Briar uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to enable direct communication between devices or to synchronize messages through a mesh network of trusted contacts. The manual provides guidance on how to use the app for secure, decentralized communication, particularly in situations where traditional internet infrastructure is unavailable or censored.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the utility and limitations of Briar and similar offline messaging tools, particularly in the context of internet shutdowns as seen in Iran. While the project is praised for its technical merits and privacy-focused design, several practical concerns and comparisons to alternatives emerged.

A key theme is the technical feasibility and user experience of Briar. Users questioned how the app achieves connectivity without the internet, with one commenter clarifying that it operates on a peer-to-peer basis, re-hosting messages between contacts. However, skepticism was raised about its real-world effectiveness, with doubts about widespread adoption in Iran and concerns over Bluetooth's limited range making a functional mesh network difficult. The user experience was also criticized as being slow and clunky, with poor media quality, leading some to view it primarily as an "emergency text messaging tool" rather than a daily-use application.

The discussion also compared Briar to other solutions like Meshtastic and Jack Dorsey's Bitchat. Commenters noted that Meshtastic nodes could be physically compromised and easily located by authorities. Bitchat was mentioned as an alternative, but faced criticism for its reliance on expensive iPhones and recent security audits that found significant vulnerabilities, with Jack Dorsey himself admitting it was "vibe coded" and unaudited.

Finally, the conversation touched on security models and platform availability. Briar's trust model, which relies on direct social connections rather than centralized identity systems like phone numbers, was analyzed and seen as a reasonable defense against certain adversary attacks. The absence of an iOS app was noted, with some justifying it by the lower market share of iPhones in regions like Iran and the desire to avoid platform-specific app stores.

## [‘ELITE’: The Palantir app ICE uses to find neighborhoods to raid](https://werd.io/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)
**Score:** 411 | **Comments:** 356 | **ID:** 46637127

> **Article:** The article "ELITE": The Palantir App ICE Uses to Find Neighborhoods to Raid" details the use of a Palantir software platform called ELITE by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The app is described as a dashboard that aggregates and visualizes data to assist agents in planning raids and identifying neighborhoods for enforcement actions. The piece highlights the role of Palantir in providing data analytics tools to government agencies for immigration enforcement operations.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly polarized, centering on the ethics of Palantir's technology, the role of its employees, and the broader U.S. immigration policy debate.

A significant portion of the comments express strong criticism and moral condemnation. Several users argue that Palantir's tools, while perhaps technically mundane ("just a dashboard"), are dangerous because they present probabilistic data that can lead to wrongful arrests, especially when used by agents with limited training. There is a recurring theme of personal responsibility, with commenters asserting that engineers working on these products cannot absolve themselves by claiming they were "just doing their job." The discussion also includes broader critiques of Palantir as a company, with some users describing its products as overhyped enterprise software and others viewing it as a vehicle for the government to circumvent privacy regulations by outsourcing surveillance to a private contractor.

Conversely, a smaller contingent of comments attempts to frame the issue as a matter of practical policy. One commenter asks for a "better system" for handling mass deportations, while another defends the use of technology by arguing that it makes enforcement more targeted rather than "indiscriminate." This perspective is met with rebuttals advocating for integration over deportation and pointing out that previous administrations also conducted deportations, albeit with less public antagonism.

The discussion also touches on the geopolitical context, with one user noting that such technology was "beta-tested on Palestinians," and another referencing the "imperial boomerang" theory—the idea that tools of control developed for foreign policy eventually get used on domestic populations. The overall sentiment is one of alarm and anger toward the technology's application in immigration enforcement.

## [OpenBSD-current now runs as guest under Apple Hypervisor](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20260115203619)
**Score:** 340 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46642560

> **Article:** The article announces that OpenBSD-current (the development version) now runs as a guest operating system under Apple's native Virtualization.framework on Apple Silicon Macs. This marks a significant step in supporting Apple's first-party virtualization stack, distinct from the previously supported Hypervisor.framework and QEMU. The update implies improved compatibility and performance for running OpenBSD virtual machines on modern Apple hardware.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is largely positive, with users highlighting several key improvements and clarifying technical details. A primary point of clarification is the distinction between Apple's frameworks: while OpenBSD has long worked with Hypervisor.framework and QEMU, this update specifically targets the Virtualization.framework. This distinction is noted as confusing but important.

The most significant practical benefit mentioned is the resolution of a long-standing QEMU bug that caused OpenBSD to hang when starting the X Window System on arm64 Macs. This fix is celebrated by users who were previously unable to try OpenBSD on their Apple Silicon machines due to this graphical interface issue. The update also addresses a compatibility hurdle with VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU negotiation, which was vague in the specification and required explicit patching in OpenBSD to work correctly with Apple's hypervisor.

Users are optimistic about the implications for local development, suggesting that the raw performance of modern M-series chips makes OpenBSD an excellent environment for tasks like testing pf firewall configurations or running isolated services. While some express disappointment that networking isn't yet fully functional, others defend the command-line-centric nature of OpenBSD. The conversation also touches on related topics, with one user hoping a similar framebuffer solution can be found for FreeBSD on Apple hardware.

## [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com/)
**Score:** 268 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46645615

> **Article:** The article links to "Just the Browser," a project that provides manual configuration files and scripts to "clean up" modern web browsers (specifically Firefox and Chrome). The goal is to remove features the author considers bloat, specifically AI integrations (like Copilot), shopping features, and telemetry. It aims to return the browser to a more minimal, "classic" state, reminiscent of older, simpler internet experiences.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the philosophy of browser minimalism, the security implications of the proposed scripts, and the broader state of UI/UX innovation.

A significant portion of the debate focused on the security risks of the project. Several users criticized the recommendation to use `curl | bash` with `sudo` to apply the changes, arguing that executing a third-party shell script with root privileges is dangerous, especially given the prevalence of supply chain attacks. The project author responded that sudo is necessary to write to protected system directories and that manual installation instructions are available for those who distrust the script.

Many commenters expressed a general fatigue with modern software "enshittification." Users reminisced about the early days of the web (IE3, early Firefox) when UI innovations like tabs felt revolutionary, contrasting this with today's cluttered experiences. There was a shared sentiment that modern browsers have become bloated with unnecessary features, leading some to switch to alternatives like Firefox or Brave to avoid AI downloads and performance hits in Chromium-based browsers.

However, there was also pushback against the project's premise. Some argued that simply disabling flags via a script is superficial and doesn't address the core architecture of the browser. Others felt that the "anti-AI" stance is reactionary, while a few defended telemetry as a necessary tool for developers to improve software, arguing that its removal might hinder progress. The discussion also touched on the omission of Safari, with some users noting that while it is less "bloated," it suffers from its own usability issues.

## [Linux boxes via SSH: suspended when disconected](https://shellbox.dev/)
**Score:** 257 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 46638629

> **Article:** The article links to Shellbox.dev, a service that provides ephemeral Linux virtual machines accessible via SSH. The core value proposition is cost-saving through automatic suspension when disconnected. Users only pay for active usage and storage, rather than for 24/7 uptime, positioning it as a simpler alternative to traditional VPS providers for sporadic tasks or development environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focuses on the service's pricing model, technical implementation, and potential use cases. A central theme is the cost-effectiveness compared to traditional VPS providers. Several users, notably Egor3f, argued that the suspended state pricing ($0.005/hour) is too high, making it less economical than a standard, always-on VPS from a provider like Hetzner. The developer (messh) acknowledged this feedback and expressed a willingness to revise the pricing.

Users explored the technical stack, with the developer revealing it is built using Python, AsyncSSH, Firecracker for VMs, and runs on large bare-metal instances. There was interest in the business model, with comparisons drawn to services like Fly.io's sprites and Railway. Feature requests and limitations were also discussed, including the lack of SFTP support (still in development), the desire for a "keepalive" feature to prevent suspension, and a creative idea to use external storage like Dropbox for persistence to avoid storage fees.

Security and payment methods were touched upon, with a suggestion to use Bitcoin's Lightning network for lower fees, though this was met with some skepticism. Overall, the community was intrigued by the concept but critical of the initial pricing, offering constructive feedback for the developer.

**Score:** 250 | **Comments:** 94 | **ID:** 46641284

> **Article:** The article is a Wikipedia page titled "List of individual trees." It catalogues trees from around the world that are notable for their historical, cultural, botanical, or aesthetic significance. The list includes a wide variety of species and locations, ranging from ancient trees like the Methuselah Tree to culturally significant landmarks and trees with unique physical characteristics, such as those that have grown around objects.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community responded to the Wikipedia list with a mix of appreciation, humor, and curiosity. Many users enjoyed the "human interest" aspect of the list, noting that it highlights the unique personalities and stories of individual trees that wouldn't be found in traditional encyclopedias. There was a specific appreciation for "normal" trees on the list, which made the global diversity of notable flora feel more accessible and relatable.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on specific, unusual entries. The "Fuck Tree" in Hampstead Heath—a tree noted for its use in a gay cruising area—generated the most comments, with users debating its notability and the appropriateness of its inclusion on Wikipedia (though one user defended it as a well-documented local landmark). Other notable mentions included the "Bicycle Tree" in Scotland and the Adyar Banyan Tree in India, with users sharing personal anecdotes and related resources.

Several commenters shared personal experiences related to the list, particularly regarding the Ancient Bristlecone Pine forest and the recently felled Sycamore Gap tree in the UK. The discussion around the Sycamore Gap tree expanded to include a user's artistic recreation of a panorama of the tree, adding a creative dimension to the thread. Overall, the conversation celebrated the idiosyncratic nature of the list and the value of crowdsourced knowledge in documenting obscure but fascinating subjects.

## [Why senior engineers let bad projects fail](https://lalitm.com/post/why-senior-engineers-let-bad-projects-fail/)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 148 | **ID:** 46640366

> **Article:** The article "Why senior engineers let bad projects fail" argues that experienced engineers should strategically choose when to intervene in projects they believe are doomed. The author contends that constantly fighting losing battles is exhausting and politically damaging. Instead, senior engineers should conserve their political capital and energy for moments that truly matter. The piece suggests that allowing a project to fail can be a valuable learning experience for the team and organization, and that sometimes the most professional action is to let natural consequences unfold rather than trying to save every failing initiative.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharp divide between pragmatic career management and ethical responsibility. Many commenters agree with the article's core premise, emphasizing strategic silence and choosing battles wisely. They argue that constantly opposing doomed projects makes one appear negative and ineffective, and that preserving political capital is essential for long-term influence. Several share personal experiences where letting projects fail taught valuable lessons or where intervening would have been futile due to organizational politics.

However, a significant counter-argument emerges around ethics and collective responsibility. Critics contend that allowing preventable failures is self-serving and harmful to the organization and colleagues. They argue that senior engineers have an ethical duty to speak up, even at personal cost, to prevent waste of resources and people's time. Some note that in smaller organizations, repeated failures can threaten everyone's job security, making inaction irresponsible.

The discussion also highlights contextual factors: the dynamics differ greatly between large corporations (where political capital matters more) versus smaller organizations (where failures have immediate consequences). Commenters debate whether silence is professional or avoidant, with some distinguishing between constructive warnings and "talking shit" about other teams. Ultimately, the consensus leans toward a balanced approach: speak up when you can be heard and when stakes are high, but don't carry the emotional burden of every failing project, and recognize that sometimes the most effective action is strategic patience.

## [Astro Joining Cloudflare](https://astro.build/blog/joining-cloudflare/)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 108 | **ID:** 46646645

> **Article:** Astro, a web framework focused on building content-driven websites, announced it is joining Cloudflare. The acquisition means Cloudflare will provide financial and operational support, allowing the Astro team to continue developing the framework full-time. The blog post frames this as a positive outcome, ensuring Astro's long-term sustainability and enabling deeper integration with Cloudflare's platform, while maintaining its open-source nature.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community had a mixed but largely analytical reaction to the acquisition. The dominant theme was questioning the strategic value for Cloudflare, with many speculating it's a play to compete with Vercel's model of hosting Next.js sites and to gain developer mindshare. Several users noted that Cloudflare's branding is already appearing in Astro's recent documentation, suggesting deeper integration is planned.

Opinions on Astro itself were divided. Many praised it as an excellent framework for content-driven sites, appreciating its simplicity compared to heavier frameworks like Next.js. However, a significant counterpoint emerged from developers who find Astro lacking for building more complex web *applications*, citing missing features like robust unit testing for Astro Actions and inter-island communication.

The discussion also touched on broader industry trends. Some users expressed a familiar cynicism about "big tech" swallowing open-source projects, though others defended Cloudflare's track record with open source and saw this as preferable to Astro becoming abandonware. A philosophical thread debated the cyclical nature of web development paradigms, with the "islands" architecture being seen by some as a reinvention of older server-side rendering concepts, while others argued that modern implementations have learned from past lessons.

## [Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, NTSB report says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly56w0p9e1o)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 101 | **ID:** 46642920

> **Article:** A new NTSB report reveals that Boeing was aware of a flaw in a part linked to a fatal 2022 UPS plane crash in Birmingham, Alabama. The report indicates that Boeing had identified the issue years prior and communicated it to airlines in 2011, stating at the time that the flaw "would not result in a safety of flight condition." The crash involved a 30-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (manufactured before the Boeing merger), and the investigation is ongoing, with maintenance practices also under scrutiny.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on Boeing's corporate responsibility and the broader challenges of aviation safety. A primary theme is the criticism of Boeing's risk assessment and transparency, with users contrasting the company's handling of this flaw with its past failures, such as the MCAS issues. Many commenters expressed skepticism toward corporate assurances, noting that Boeing has a "proven record of lying" and suggesting that financial calculations may have prioritized cost over safety.

Other key topics included the technical realities of aircraft maintenance. Users debated whether the inspection intervals for aging aircraft (like the 30-year-old MD-11) are sufficient, with some explaining the rigorous "D-check" process that involves partial disassembly, while others argued that the specific part in question was difficult to access and inspect visually. There was also a comparison to historical aerospace projects like the SR-71, though commenters generally agreed that commercial aviation requires a much higher safety standard than military reconnaissance, which operated with higher risk tolerance and failure rates. Finally, some users expressed broader concern regarding the politicization of safety investigations and the reliability of oversight bodies.

## [Data is the only moat](https://frontierai.substack.com/p/data-is-your-only-moat)
**Score:** 188 | **Comments:** 41 | **ID:** 46637328

> **Article:** The article argues that in the age of AI, proprietary data is the only sustainable competitive advantage ("moat"). It posits that while algorithms and compute power can be replicated or acquired by well-funded competitors, unique, high-quality datasets—especially those generated from real-world user interactions or specialized domains—cannot be easily copied. The author suggests that companies should focus on building products that generate valuable data loops, rather than relying solely on model architecture or engineering talent, which are increasingly commoditized.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted critique of the "data is the only moat" thesis, exploring various alternative sources of defensibility.

Several users argued that other traditional business moats remain potent. These include distribution channels, brand reputation, network effects, and regulatory positioning. One commenter noted that as foundation models improve, many problems that currently require proprietary data will become trivial, diminishing the long-term value of static datasets. Others emphasized the importance of "attention" over raw data, suggesting that capturing user focus is the primary commodity, especially in consumer products, which then naturally generates valuable data.

A significant counterpoint raised was the value of algorithmic and architectural breakthroughs. Commenters cited examples like the performance improvements between GPT-3 and 3.5 (using the same data) and the success of DeepSeek, arguing that novel thinking and engineering can outperform data-heavy approaches. This led to a debate on whether such breakthroughs are truly defensible, with some noting that top talent can be hired to replicate innovations, while others worried about the "grey market" competition via model distillation.

The discussion also highlighted the context-dependency of data's value. While data is crucial for AI capabilities in fields like biology or chemistry, some argued that in consumer software, "context" and user experience (e.g., low friction, reliability, design) are more critical moats than the data itself. Finally, the ethics of data ownership were touched upon, with users expressing frustration over platforms locking away user-generated data and reselling it, calling for greater regulation and user control.

## [CVEs affecting the Svelte ecosystem](https://svelte.dev/blog/cves-affecting-the-svelte-ecosystem)
**Score:** 172 | **Comments:** 28 | **ID:** 46636387

> **Article:** The Svelte team announced five Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) affecting the Svelte ecosystem, primarily centered around the `devalue` serialization library and experimental Remote Functions features. The vulnerabilities include three Denial of Service (DoS) issues caused by memory/CPU exhaustion, one potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) combined with DoS during prerendering, and one Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The team noted that most of these issues only impact applications using experimental features, specifically Remote Functions or async hydration modes. Static builds and applications not using these experimental features are largely unaffected.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction was generally measured, with many users noting that the severity of these vulnerabilities is mitigated by their limited scope. Several commenters pointed out that three of the five CVEs require Remote Functions to be enabled, which is still marked as experimental, while the XSS vulnerability requires the experimental `hydratable` feature. Users appreciated the Svelte team's transparency in the disclosure and noted that similar parsing vulnerabilities are common across web frameworks, with one user citing recent security fixes in Go's HTTP form parsing as an example.

Discussion participants expressed mixed feelings about the `devalue` library itself, with some commenters admitting they had previously found the code "sketchy" or had concerns about how it handled user inputs. However, the consensus was that these were resource exhaustion attacks rather than more severe remote code execution vulnerabilities, making them less critical than recent security issues in other frameworks. Static site users confirmed they were unaffected, and the community generally viewed this as a manageable security update rather than a crisis.

## [JuiceFS is a distributed POSIX file system built on top of Redis and S3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs)
**Score:** 168 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 46637165

> **Article:** The article links to the GitHub repository for JuiceFS, a distributed POSIX file system. JuiceFS decouples metadata from data, storing metadata in a database like Redis and data objects in an object store like S3. This architecture aims to provide high performance, scalability, and durability for cloud-native storage.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a mixed but technically deep evaluation of JuiceFS, focusing on its architecture, performance, and practical trade-offs.

A central theme is the debate over JuiceFS's architecture and its comparison to alternatives. One user promoted ZeroFS, claiming it outperforms JuiceFS on small file workloads and has a simpler deployment model (S3 only). However, this was met with skepticism from another user who questioned the benchmark's methodology, suggesting it might be an "apples-to-oranges" comparison. The architecture's reliance on a metadata store like Redis drew criticism for potential reliability and performance bottlenecks, with some users expressing distrust in Redis for such a critical role and suggesting alternatives like Valkey or RocksDB. In response, others defended Redis's reliability when properly configured and highlighted the benefits of the JuiceFS model: effectively unbounded storage, speed, low cost, and horizontal scalability.

The practical application and limitations of JuiceFS were also heavily scrutinized. Several users noted that JuiceFS writes data to object storage in its own proprietary format, meaning that if the metadata store is lost, the data becomes inaccessible, a significant drawback for those prioritizing data durability outside the system. Performance concerns were raised, with one commenter sharing that they moved away from JuiceFS due to insufficient performance for their training workloads and the constraint of a single metadata store location. The use of FUSE was also flagged as a potential source of "gotchas," making it a risky replacement for NFS in all scenarios.

Finally, the discussion touched on the broader context of distributed file systems. A user inquired about using JuiceFS as a replacement for NFS in the silicon design industry, citing common NFS pain points. The conversation also connected JuiceFS to the "Sprites" project, which uses a heavily modified version of JuiceFS with a custom SQLite metadata backend, illustrating a real-world use case and adaptation of the technology. Overall, the community viewed JuiceFS as a powerful but complex tool with significant trade-offs regarding metadata management, data portability, and performance characteristics.

## [Tldraw pauses external contributions due to AI slop](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 86 | **ID:** 46641042

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue from the tldraw project announcing a temporary pause on external contributions. The decision was made due to a significant influx of low-quality, AI-generated pull requests ("AI slop") that are overwhelming the maintainers. The project states that an open PR represents a commitment to careful review, and the current volume of unsolicited, automated contributions makes this unsustainable. They plan to re-evaluate and potentially reopen contributions in the future, possibly with new tools or processes.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates tldraw's experience, framing the issue as a systemic shift in open-source maintenance. A central theme is the inversion of the maintainer's workload: the primary challenge is no longer writing code, but reviewing an overwhelming volume of AI-generated submissions. Commenters express concern that this will lead to a severe increase in maintainer burnout, as reviewing code is less satisfying than writing it and the quality of incoming contributions is often poor.

Several points were raised about the cause and potential solutions. Some users noted that tldraw had actively invited AI contributions by creating detailed instructions for agents, suggesting their current policy is a reaction to that experiment failing. The discussion also highlighted a contrast in approaches, with the Ghostty project cited as an example that accepts AI-assisted contributions but requires strict disclosure and human oversight. One commenter shared a positive anecdote from Ghostty's maintainer, Mitchell Hashimoto, who described a high-quality contribution from a non-expert who used AI as a tool with expert guidance, suggesting that the problem isn't AI itself, but the lack of critical human oversight.

Broader implications were also debated. Some argued that the culture of GitHub, with its prominent display of open PR counts, creates an expectation of engagement that exacerbates the problem, contrasting it with older mailing-list workflows where the barrier to entry was higher. Others predicted that projects will increasingly move to more private or gated collaboration models, and that the role of developers will shift from "writers" to "readers" and reviewers. The sentiment was largely pessimistic, with many commenters sharing their own frustrations with AI slop and expressing little faith in platforms like GitHub to provide effective solutions.

## [UK offshore wind prices come in 40% cheaper than gas in record auction](https://electrek.co/2026/01/14/uk-offshore-wind-record-auction/)
**Score:** 158 | **Comments:** 95 | **ID:** 46637399

> **Article:** The article reports on a UK government auction for renewable energy contracts (Contracts for Difference), where offshore wind projects secured record-low prices. The winning bid price for offshore wind is cited as being 40% cheaper than the projected cost of electricity generated by gas-fired power plants (CCGTs). This is presented as a major milestone for the UK's transition to renewable energy, demonstrating the increasing cost-competitiveness of wind power even without subsidies in some cases.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide over the economic and technical realities of integrating cheap renewable energy into the grid. While the headline figure is positive, many commenters argue that the comparison is misleading and that the total system cost is much higher than the headline "strike price" suggests.

Key points of contention include:

*   **The UK's Electricity Pricing Model:** Several users criticized the UK's marginal pricing system, where all electricity is sold at the price of the most expensive source (typically gas). This means cheap wind power is effectively paid the high gas price, resulting in "windfall profits" for renewable generators while consumers still face high bills. Others defended this model as essential for price discovery and incentivizing low-cost bids, arguing that alternative systems would be inefficient or amount to theft.

*   **Hidden Costs and System Reliability:** A major theme was the "hidden" costs of wind power that are not included in the strike price. Critics pointed out that wind is intermittent, requiring expensive backup power (peaker plants), grid upgrades, and storage. They argued that comparing the raw cost of wind to the raw cost of gas is an "apples to oranges" comparison because gas provides dispatchable, reliable power, whereas wind does not. One user noted that the government's own report on gas generation costs used assumptions (like low capacity factor) that inflated the final price, making wind look comparatively cheaper.

*   **The Role of Carbon Pricing:** One commenter pointed out that the gas price cited in the article includes a government carbon tax, making the unsubsidized cost of gas (£55/MWh) significantly lower than the wind strike price (£91.20/MWh). However, others countered that carbon pricing is a necessary and rational policy to account for the external costs of emissions, making the comparison fair.

*   **Counterarguments on System Costs:** Proponents of wind power offered counterarguments. They noted that idled gas plants still save significant money on fuel costs and that wind power has a massive secondary benefit of reducing demand for natural gas, thereby lowering gas bills for the entire economy, not just electricity bills. They also pointed to existing mechanisms, like the capacity market, designed to compensate for intermittency.

Overall, the discussion moved beyond the simple headline to a complex debate about energy economics, market design, and the practical challenges of a green transition. The consensus was that the "cheaper than gas" claim is highly dependent on which costs are included in the calculation.

**Score:** 139 | **Comments:** 126 | **ID:** 46644962

> **Article:** The article, "On Being a Human Being in the Time of Collapse," is a transcript of a 2022 talk by computer science professor Phillip Rogaway. Rogaway argues that humanity is facing a multifaceted crisis, driven by environmental destruction, rampant surveillance capitalism, and political instability, which he terms a "civilizational collapse." He critiques the tech industry and computer science academia for their complicity in this crisis, particularly through work that enables surveillance, extraction, and social control. Rogaway calls for a fundamental reorientation of personal and professional life, urging individuals, especially those in technical fields, to reject neutrality and actively "help" by refusing harmful work, pushing back within institutions, and dedicating their skills to the public good. He frames this as a moral and existential challenge, demanding a move away from nihilism and despair towards meaningful, albeit difficult, action.

## [Supply Chain Vuln Compromised Core AWS GitHub Repos & Threatened the AWS Console](https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-codebreach-vulnerability-aws-codebuild)
**Score:** 136 | **Comments:** 34 | **ID:** 46636093

> **Article:** A critical supply chain vulnerability, dubbed "CodeBreach," was discovered in AWS's infrastructure, affecting core GitHub repositories and threatening the AWS Console. The flaw stemmed from a misconfigured regular expression in GitHub Actions workflow allowlists for repositories like the AWS JS SDK. The regex, intended to restrict workflow execution to specific contributor IDs, was not properly anchored. This allowed attackers to create GitHub accounts with IDs containing the allowed numbers (e.g., if "12345" was allowed, an ID like "9123456" would also pass). By spamming GitHub with account creation requests, the researchers successfully generated an ID that matched the regex, gaining the ability to execute malicious code in pull request workflows. This code could exfiltrate long-lived GitHub access tokens. Although these tokens lacked direct admin rights, they had sufficient permissions to invite other users to become administrators, effectively escalating the attack. AWS has since fixed the regex and implemented an additional "approve workflow run" step in the PR process to prevent unauthorized executions.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion focused on several key aspects of the vulnerability and its implications. A primary point of analysis was the technical root cause: the use of a fragile, unanchored regex for security-critical allowlists, which is a common anti-pattern. Commenters also highlighted the cascading failure of GitHub's permission model, where a token with limited scope could be used to gain full administrative privileges by inviting another user.

The conversation also touched on the broader context of AWS's security posture, with some users ironically noting that AWS, a company known for advocating temporary credentials, was compromised by long-lived tokens. The incident was seen by some as indicative of underlying quality issues with other AWS developer tools, like CodeCommit. Finally, there was a brief ethical debate about the researchers' "proof-of-concept" escalation—inviting their own account as an admin—which most agreed was a justified step to demonstrate the full impact of the vulnerability without causing harm.

## [My Gripes with Prolog](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/my-gripes-with-prolog/)
**Score:** 135 | **Comments:** 79 | **ID:** 46641348

> **Article:** The article "My Gripes with Prolog" by Hillel Wayne details his frustrations after attempting to use Prolog for a project. He identifies several key issues: the lack of standardized string handling across different Prolog implementations (e.g., SWI-Prolog vs. Scryer Prolog), the unintuitive behavior of the negation-as-failure operator (`\+`) when dealing with unbound variables, and the need to manually reorder predicate clauses for correct execution, which he feels undermines the language's declarative promise. He also critiques the `cut` operator (`!`) as a necessary but dangerous optimization tool. The article concludes by mentioning his exploration of Picat, a successor language that addresses some of these syntactic and practical issues.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is largely critical of the article's premises, with many commenters defending Prolog's design and accusing the author of a fundamental misunderstanding of logic programming.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the author's qualifications and approach. Several users argue that the article reads like the work of an "impatient newbie" who hasn't invested enough time to understand Prolog's unique paradigm, suggesting he read canonical texts like "The Art of Prolog." They contend that the author's complaints about the `cut` operator and negation stem from misinterpreting them as simple optimization tools rather than core control structures, and that describing predicates as "returning true or false" is a sign of a flawed mental model. However, other commenters push back on this, pointing out that the author has written about Prolog before and that some gripes, like the lack of string standardization, are valid practical concerns regardless of one's expertise.

Another theme is the language's syntax and accessibility. While one user defends Prolog's syntax as a direct representation of first-order logic, others agree it's a barrier and speculate on how it could be integrated into more mainstream languages. This led to mentions of embedded logic programming systems like miniKanren and Datalog.

Finally, the discussion offered practical resources and counterpoints. A user shared a link to a fully-featured tiling window manager written in Prolog to demonstrate its real-world viability. Others recommended specific learning materials and pointed to the Power of Prolog online resource as a way to properly ground oneself in the language's concepts.

## [Interactive eBPF](https://ebpf.party/)
**Score:** 127 | **Comments:** 6 | **ID:** 46644181

> **Article:** The article links to "ebpf.party," an interactive learning platform for eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter). The site is designed to provide hands-on exercises for developers to learn how to write and run eBPF programs, aiming to lower the barrier to entry for this complex kernel technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response to the platform is overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing gratitude to the creator and enthusiasm for having a practical way to learn eBPF. Commenters highlight the value of interactive exercises for a technology that is often considered difficult to approach. 

A notable technical concern is raised regarding the security implications of eBPF. One user questions if the technology creates a significant attack surface, suggesting that its powerful features could potentially be exploited by rootkits to hide malicious activity. The creator is open to feedback, inviting suggestions for future lessons, such as the differences between deployment methods like libbcc and CO-RE.

## [America could have $4 lunch bowls like Japan but for zoning laws](https://abio.substack.com/p/america-could-have-4-lunch-bowls)
**Score:** 125 | **Comments:** 125 | **ID:** 46646970

> **Article:** The article argues that the United States could achieve low-cost dining options, like Japan's $4 lunch bowls, if not for restrictive zoning laws. It uses Japan as a model for efficient, small-footprint businesses enabled by permissive regulations, contrasting this with the U.S. system of "death by a thousand cuts" where individually reasonable rules (parking minimums, land-use restrictions) collectively stifle small enterprises and drive up costs for consumers.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a complex debate about the root causes of high costs for small businesses in the U.S., with zoning laws serving as a central but contested focal point.

A significant portion of the comments challenges the article's premise by highlighting economic realities in Japan. Several users argue that Japan's low prices are a function of low local wages, not just efficient regulation. They point out that while $4 bowls are cheap for Americans earning in USD, they are expensive relative to the median Japanese household income, which is significantly lower than in the U.S. This economic context is linked to rising domestic discontent and political shifts in Japan, suggesting the low-cost model isn't without its own societal costs.

The role of zoning laws is a primary point of contention. While the article blames zoning, commenters broaden the scope. Some argue that other regulations in non-zoned cities like Houston achieve similar restrictive outcomes. Others contend that the problem is less about land-use rules and more about commercial landlord behavior, where high rents and speculative holding of vacant properties prevent affordable businesses from opening. A planning commissioner offers a ground-level perspective, stating that public apathy and a desire to preserve the past are major barriers to zoning reform.

Finally, the discussion touches on labor and business models. One commenter posits that the U.S. lacks the type of low-wage, high-effort labor common in Japan, making such business models unviable regardless of regulations. Another suggests alternative models like "ghost kitchens" could bypass some physical and regulatory hurdles. The overall sentiment is that while zoning is a critical barrier, it is part of a larger ecosystem of economic, social, and regulatory factors that prevent the U.S. from replicating Japan's low-cost dining scene.
