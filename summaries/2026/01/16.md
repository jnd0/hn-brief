## [‘ELITE’: The Palantir app ICE uses to find neighborhoods to raid](https://werd.io/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)
**Score:** 418 | **Comments:** 363 | **ID:** 46637127

> **Article:** The article "‘ELITE’: The Palantir app ICE uses to find neighborhoods to raid" details the use of a Palantir-developed application named ELITE by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The tool is designed to aggregate and analyze data to identify specific neighborhoods and locations for immigration raids. The article frames this technology as a key enabler of ICE's enforcement operations, highlighting the collaboration between a private tech company and federal immigration authorities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with commenters debating the technology itself, the ethics of its development, and the broader political context of immigration enforcement.

A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the nature of Palantir's technology. Several users downplay the "fearsome" or "demonic" aspects of the software, describing ELITE as essentially a sophisticated dashboard or a "typical enterprise vendor" product. They argue that Palantir's core offering is a graph database and mapping tool customized by consultants, and that the truly sensitive data is supplied by the government client (ICE), not generated by Palantir. This perspective shifts the focus from the tech company's inherent capabilities to the policy decisions of the government agency using it.

However, this view is countered by strong ethical concerns. Critics argue that even a "simple" dashboard presenting probabilistic information can lead to wrongful arrests, especially when used by agents with minimal training. The moral responsibility of the engineers and developers building these tools is a central theme, with commenters drawing parallels to historical justifications for complicity ("I was only in charge of transport"). There is a widespread sentiment that those working on such products are participating in harmful activities, regardless of their personal intentions.

The discussion also delves into the political and ideological dimensions of the issue. Commenters debate the necessity and morality of mass deportations, with some framing it as a logistical reality and others rejecting it as a cruel and inhumane policy. The use of Palantir by ICE is linked to broader critiques of government surveillance, corporate-state collusion (described as a "de-facto corporate state"), and the idea that technologies tested on populations abroad (e.g., Palestinians) are later deployed domestically. The conversation reflects a deep division on immigration policy and the role of technology in enforcing it.

The announcement, framed from Astro's perspective, emphasizes that the acquisition secures the project's long-term financial sustainability, allowing the core team to focus full-time on development. The blog post highlights a shared vision with Cloudflare for the future of the web, particularly around performance and edge computing, and assures users that Astro will remain open-source and framework-agnostic.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reaction is mixed, balancing enthusiasm for the technology with skepticism about corporate consolidation.

Many users express excitement about the combination of two popular tools, noting that Astro and Cloudflare are a natural technical fit for building fast, static, or edge-rendered sites. However, a significant portion of the discussion focuses on the strategic implications. Some users worry this is "big tech swallowing another open-source project," fearing potential lock-in or a shift in priorities away from the community. Others counter that Cloudflare has a good track record with open source and that this is preferable to Astro struggling to monetize or becoming abandonware.

The conversation also diverges into the strategic value for each company: Cloudflare gains developer mindshare and a potential competitor to Vercel's model, while Astro gains financial stability. There is a notable debate about Astro's actual utility. While many praise it for being a lightweight alternative to heavy frameworks like Next.js, some developers express disappointment with its feature set, arguing it is still immature for building complex "apps" due to a lack of features like inter-island communication and robust unit testing. Finally, the acquisition sparked a broader, philosophical debate about the cyclical nature of web development trends, with some commenters lamenting the constant reinvention of paradigms like server-side rendering.

## [OpenBSD-current now runs as guest under Apple Hypervisor](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20260115203619)
**Score:** 363 | **Comments:** 46 | **ID:** 46642560

> **Article:** The article announces that OpenBSD-current (the development version) now runs as a guest operating system under Apple's native Virtualization.framework on Apple Silicon. This marks a significant step in bringing full virtualization support to OpenBSD on macOS, moving beyond previous reliance on emulation layers like QEMU. The update specifically enables critical features such as virtio-gpu support, resolving previous issues that caused graphical interfaces to fail, and improves networking compatibility by handling MTU negotiation correctly.
>
> **Discussion:** The community reaction is largely positive, with users highlighting several key improvements. The most significant practical benefit mentioned is the resolution of a long-standing bug that prevented OpenBSD from running a graphical environment (X) on ARM64 via QEMU, which is particularly valuable for users with Apple Silicon Macs who want to try the OS. The discussion also clarifies the distinction between Apple's frameworks, noting that OpenBSD had prior support for Hypervisor.framework but this update targets the Virtualization.framework, which is more integrated into macOS.

Technical details were also discussed, specifically the implementation of VIRTIO_NET_F_MTU negotiation, which was a roadblock for many guest operating systems on Apple's stack. This fix allows for more robust networking. While some users expressed disappointment that networking and X support aren't fully ready yet, others countered that OpenBSD is traditionally command-line oriented. A minor tangent touched on memory management in VMs, with one user noting that RAM usage doesn't always shrink after allocation, though this was explained as a complex aspect of virtualization rather than a specific OpenBSD bug. Overall, the update is seen as a major milestone for local development and testing on Apple hardware.

## [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com/)
**Score:** 343 | **Comments:** 177 | **ID:** 46645615

> **Article:** The article links to "Just the Browser," a project that provides scripts to configure Firefox and Chrome to be more minimal and privacy-focused. The project aims to remove modern browser features deemed unnecessary or intrusive, such as AI integrations (e.g., Copilot), shopping tools, and telemetry. It also changes the default search engine and disables various other flags. The site presents itself as a way to return to a simpler, more traditional web browsing experience, referencing the era of early browsers like Mosaic and IE3.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a mix of nostalgia for a simpler web, skepticism about the project's methods, and broader debates on AI and browser functionality.

A prominent theme is a longing for the past, with users reminiscing about the early days of the web (IE3, Mosaic) and the excitement around fundamental UI/UX innovations like tabs and HTML forms. This nostalgia is contrasted with a feeling that modern "innovation" is often intrusive and inconsistent, with some commenters expressing a desire for standardization and predictability over constant change.

The project's implementation drew significant criticism. Several users pointed out the security risks of running third-party shell scripts with elevated privileges (sudo/admin access) just to change a few configuration flags. They argued that the changes could be made manually and that the script's approach, particularly for PowerShell, was unnecessarily risky and lacked best practices like code signing. Others noted that the scripts don't cover all browser configurations and that some changes (like disabling features) might break websites.

The discussion also broadened into a debate about AI in browsers. While the project is explicitly anti-AI, commenters had mixed views. Some supported the anti-AI stance, believing it's a justified reaction to hype, while others felt it was a "Monkey's Paw" scenario where removing AI doesn't fix the underlying issues of bloat and telemetry. A user shared a personal anecdote about Chrome downloading a large AI model in the background without clear notification, fueling the anti-bloat sentiment.

Finally, there was a notable observation about Safari's absence from the project. Commenters suggested this is because Safari hasn't undergone the same "enshittification" as Chrome and Firefox, and because Apple lacks a major AI product to integrate, making it a relatively "cleaner" browser by default in this context. The topic of Mozilla's telemetry also came up, with users debating whether the data collection has actually helped improve Firefox, with many concluding it has not.

**Score:** 286 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46641284

> **Article:** The Wikipedia article "List of individual trees" is a catalog of trees that are notable for reasons beyond their species, such as historical significance, unusual characteristics, or cultural impact. The list includes a wide variety of trees, from ancient and giant specimens like the Methuselah Pine to trees with unique stories, such as the "bicycle tree" in Scotland that has grown around a bicycle. The article is presented as a comprehensive but not exhaustive collection, with an invitation for users to add notable trees with proper sourcing.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion was largely positive, with users expressing appreciation for the article's unique and human-interest angle. Many commenters shared personal anecdotes, such as visiting the Ancient Bristlecone Pine forest or noticing trees in old graveyards. The conversation also touched on the nature of Wikipedia, with some celebrating its ability to document obscure but interesting topics that would never appear in a traditional encyclopedia.

A significant portion of the discussion focused on a particularly unusual entry: a tree in London's Hampstead Heath known for its use in gay cruising. While some users found this entry surprising or humorous, others defended its inclusion as a factual and documented part of the tree's cultural history. The conversation also branched into related topics, with users sharing links to other Wikipedia lists (like "List of superlative trees") and discussing the phenomenon of trees growing around objects. The tragic felling of the Sycamore Gap tree in the UK was also mentioned as a notable real-world event connected to the topic.

## [Linux boxes via SSH: suspended when disconected](https://shellbox.dev/)
**Score:** 277 | **Comments:** 142 | **ID:** 46638629

> **Article:** The article links to shellbox.dev, a service that provides Linux boxes via SSH that are automatically suspended when disconnected to save costs. The service aims to offer a simpler alternative to traditional VPS management, with a pay-as-you-go model where users only pay for active usage and storage while suspended.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals mixed reactions to the service, with several key themes emerging. Pricing emerged as the primary concern, with users comparing the $36/month cost unfavorably to traditional VPS providers like Hetzner ($4.09/month for 24/7 service) and noting that even the suspended state pricing seemed high. The developer acknowledged this feedback and indicated willingness to revise pricing.

Technical implementation details were explored, with the developer revealing the stack uses Python with AsyncSSH, Firecracker for VMs, memory-mapped files for RAM, Paddle for billing, and Caddy as a reverse proxy, running on large bare metal instances. Users noted limitations like lack of SFTP support (still WIP) and the requirement for OpenSSH's legacy SCP protocol.

Use cases were debated, with some questioning the practicality versus traditional VPS solutions, while others appreciated the simplicity and potential for cost savings in intermittent usage scenarios. Creative feature requests emerged, including Dropbox integration for persistent storage, keep-alive options when disconnected, and alternative payment methods like Bitcoin Lightning.

Several users compared it to similar services like exe.dev and Fly's sprites, noting differences in pricing models. Security concerns were raised regarding potential misuse, and the developer mentioned considering open-sourcing the project after cleaning up the codebase. Overall, the community seemed intrigued by the concept but skeptical about the current pricing and practical implementation.

## [Why senior engineers let bad projects fail](https://lalitm.com/post/why-senior-engineers-let-bad-projects-fail/)
**Score:** 244 | **Comments:** 154 | **ID:** 46640366

> **Article:** The article "Why senior engineers let bad projects fail" argues that experienced engineers often choose not to intervene in projects they predict will fail. The author posits that this is not due to apathy, but a calculated decision based on political reality and self-preservation. In large organizations, senior engineers often lack the authority to stop a project initiated by management or other teams. Attempting to fight a losing battle consumes political capital, burns bridges, and labels the engineer as negative or obstructionist. The author advises that senior engineers should "pick their battles," saving their influence for issues critical to the company's survival or their own direct responsibilities, rather than wasting energy on doomed initiatives they cannot change.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a sharp divide between pragmatic career management and ethical responsibility. A central theme is the tension between "letting it fail" to preserve one's political capital and standing up for what is right, even at personal cost.

Many commenters validate the article's premise, arguing that employment is a business transaction, not an ethical crusade. They emphasize that engineers are often "replaceable cogs" without the political power to change outcomes, and that constantly fighting losing battles makes one ineffective and unpopular. The consensus among this group is that seniority involves strategic silence—picking battles wisely and not carrying the emotional burden of every project's failure.

However, a significant counter-argument focuses on the ethical and organizational cost of inaction. Commenters argue that allowing preventable failure is harmful to the company's goals and culture, and that standing up for the right approach is a mark of true seniority. There is a nuanced middle ground where many agree that engineers should speak up and offer advice, but must learn to disengage if their advice is ignored, refusing to take on the emotional weight of the outcome.

Additional points of discussion included:
*   **The value of failure:** Some noted that letting people (or managers) fail can be a valuable learning experience, provided the stakes aren't company-ending.
*   **Professionalism:** A side debate emerged about a manager in the original article sharing negative opinions with a junior engineer, with some calling it unprofessional and others viewing it as necessary transparency.
*   **Universality:** Several commenters noted these dynamics are not unique to tech but are inherent to human nature and politics in any large organization.

## [Boeing knew of flaw in part linked to UPS plane crash, NTSB report says](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly56w0p9e1o)
**Score:** 244 | **Comments:** 118 | **ID:** 46642920

> **Article:** A recent NTSB report indicates that Boeing was aware of a flaw in a part linked to a fatal 2010 UPS plane crash in Dubai but classified the risk as low. The report reveals that Boeing issued a service bulletin in 2011 recommending a visual inspection of the slat track assembly, a critical wing component. However, the investigation highlights that the part is difficult to access and that visual inspection may be insufficient to detect the specific type of metal fatigue involved. The crash, which killed both pilots, involved a Boeing 747-400, and the investigation underscores ongoing concerns regarding Boeing's risk assessment and transparency.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on Boeing's accountability, the effectiveness of maintenance protocols, and broader concerns about corporate culture and safety standards. A primary theme is the criticism of Boeing's risk assessment, with users debating whether the company knowingly downplayed a dangerous flaw or simply miscalculated the risk. Several commenters express skepticism about the feasibility of the recommended visual inspections, noting the part's inaccessibility and the difficulty of detecting metal fatigue visually.

There is also a comparison of Boeing's current issues to its historical reputation, particularly regarding the MD-11 and DC-10 models, and skepticism about the safety of upcoming projects like the Artemis moon mission. The conversation touches on the reliability of complex systems, with some users arguing that all technology has flaws and risk management is necessary, while others contend that Boeing's history of misleading statements erodes trust. Additionally, the discussion briefly touches on the potential for political corruption influencing safety investigations, though this is a minor point.

## [Data is the only moat](https://frontierai.substack.com/p/data-is-your-only-moat)
**Score:** 192 | **Comments:** 44 | **ID:** 46637328

> **Article:** The article "Data is the only moat" argues that in the current AI landscape, proprietary data is the sole sustainable competitive advantage. The author posits that while algorithms and architectures are important, they are quickly commoditized and replicated by competitors. In contrast, unique, high-quality datasets—especially those generated by user interactions or proprietary processes—are difficult to replicate and provide a lasting edge. The piece suggests that companies focusing on accumulating and leveraging exclusive data will ultimately dominate, while those relying solely on model architecture will find their advantages eroded as open-source models catch up.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely challenges the article's absolutist claim, offering a nuanced view on what constitutes a "moat" in the AI era. While some commenters agree that data is crucial, particularly for specialized domains like biology or chemistry, many argue that other factors are equally or more important.

Key counter-arguments and alternative perspectives include:
*   **Attention and Distribution:** Several users argued that user attention and distribution channels are the true moats. One commenter noted that with attention, data often follows for free, and monetization is primarily driven by capturing attention, not just possessing data. This is especially relevant for consumer products, though its applicability to B2B was questioned.
*   **Algorithmic and Architectural Breakthroughs:** A significant viewpoint is that algorithmic innovation remains a powerful, portable advantage. The ability to hire top talent to replicate breakthroughs (as Meta does) was cited as a reason why architectural insights can still create a defensible position.
*   **Execution and Brand Moats:** Others highlighted traditional business moats like brand trust, network effects, regulatory positioning, and execution speed. A compelling brand can create fierce loyalty that data alone cannot replicate.
*   **The Diminishing Utility of Data Hoards:** A counterpoint suggested that the value of massive, static datasets is bounded. With techniques like distillation, frontier models can be used to generate high-quality synthetic data or be siphoned off, creating strong "fast-follow" competition that erodes the data advantage over time.
*   **Context and User Ownership:** The importance of context was raised as a non-fungible asset, and one commenter expressed frustration with platforms locking up user-generated data, calling for regulation to give users more control.

## [JuiceFS is a distributed POSIX file system built on top of Redis and S3](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs)
**Score:** 173 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46637165

> **Article:** JuiceFS is an open-source, distributed POSIX file system that uses an object store (like S3) for data storage and a separate metadata engine (like Redis) for managing file system metadata. This architecture decouples data from metadata to provide high performance, scalability, and compatibility with existing cloud storage infrastructure. The project is highlighted for its ability to handle large-scale data workloads and its use in production environments.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion presents a multifaceted view of JuiceFS, balancing its innovative design with practical trade-offs and competitive pressures. The conversation is largely driven by comparisons with other technologies and real-world deployment experiences.

A central theme is the debate over JuiceFS's architecture, particularly its reliance on an external metadata store like Redis. While some users express concern about trusting Redis for critical metadata, others defend it as a reliable choice when configured correctly, emphasizing the benefits of scalability and ease of setup. The recent emergence of ZeroFS, a competitor that uses only S3 and claims superior performance, sparked a direct challenge. However, this was met with skepticism from the community regarding the fairness and methodology of its benchmarks, leading to a defense of JuiceFS's established performance and design.

User experiences reveal significant trade-offs. JuiceFS is praised for its ability to scale to petabytes and its utility in specific contexts, such as replacing NFS in high-performance computing (HPC) environments where NFS is known to be problematic. However, several commenters highlight critical limitations. A major concern is that JuiceFS writes data to S3 in a proprietary format, meaning that without the corresponding metadata store, the data is effectively inaccessible. This undermines a key advantage of using object storage—data durability and independence from the file system layer. Performance is another point of contention; while it can be fast, the metadata store can become a bottleneck, and some users reported it was insufficient for their demanding workloads like AI training.

The discussion also touches on the broader philosophy of data storage. One perspective suggests that for truly large-scale, critical production workloads, the best approach is to make applications natively compatible with S3, avoiding the complexity and potential failure points of a file system abstraction layer. In contrast, JuiceFS is positioned as a powerful and practical solution for teams that need a POSIX-compliant interface without rewriting their applications. The "Sprites" project is cited as a key example, using a heavily modified JuiceFS to underpin its storage stack, demonstrating its flexibility and real-world application.

## [Michelangelo's first painting, created when he was 12 or 13](https://www.openculture.com/2026/01/discover-michelangelos-first-painting.html)
**Score:** 170 | **Comments:** 105 | **ID:** 46646263

> **Article:** The article from Open Culture discusses a painting attributed to Michelangelo, created when he was approximately 12 or 13 years old. The work, titled "The Torment of Saint Anthony," depicts demons attacking the saint. It is noted as the only Michelangelo painting in the Americas and one of only four easel paintings attributed to him, highlighting his general disdain for oil painting later in his career.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion primarily revolves around clarifying the context and authenticity of the painting. Several commenters correct the premise that this was Michelangelo's "first" painting, noting it is simply his earliest known surviving work and that he would have had years of prior training. A significant point of debate is the painting's originality; multiple users point out that it is not an original composition but a copy of an engraving by Martin Schongauer, serving as a practice master study rather than a unique creation.

Users also debated the attribution and provenance of the piece, with some expressing skepticism about the certainty of attributing works from that era to a single artist versus a workshop. The conversation briefly touched on the broader implications of such discoveries, including how modern distractions might affect artistic development and the accessibility of materials today compared to the Renaissance. Finally, a few comments offered personal connections to the art, such as visiting the museum where it is housed, and drew parallels between the painting's style and how a modern child might depict comic book heroes.

## [Tldraw pauses external contributions due to AI slop](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw/issues/7695)
**Score:** 165 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 46641042

> **Article:** The article links to a GitHub issue from the tldraw project announcing a temporary pause on all external contributions. The decision was made due to a significant increase in low-quality, AI-generated pull requests ("AI slop") that are overwhelming the maintainers. The project states that an open pull request represents a commitment to careful review, and the current volume of unsolicited AI-generated code makes this unsustainable. They plan to re-enable contributions in the future, possibly after GitHub introduces better management features.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion largely validates the project's decision, exploring the broader implications of AI on open-source maintenance. A central theme is the shift in maintainer workload from writing code to reviewing it. Commenters note that while AI can generate code instantly, the human effort required to read, understand, and validate these contributions remains high, leading to a significant imbalance and potential for burnout.

There is a debate over the project's own role in attracting AI contributions. Some users pointed out that tldraw had created detailed instructions for AI agents, suggesting they invited the problem. However, others countered that these instructions were likely intended for the maintainers' own use with AI, not as an open invitation for unsolicited, low-quality external PRs.

The discussion highlights a stark contrast between two types of AI-assisted contributions. One side describes the negative experience of "slop"—automated, often nonsensical, and time-wasting submissions. The other side, citing an example from the Ghostty project, shows that AI can be a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled and thoughtful user. In that case, an individual with no domain expertise used AI to analyze crash reports and identify real bugs, demonstrating that the quality of the output depends heavily on the user's critical thinking and approach.

Finally, the conversation broadened to critique GitHub's culture, with some commenters arguing that the platform's prominent display of open PR counts creates an implicit pressure on maintainers. They contrast this with older, mailing-list-based workflows where submitting a patch carried no expectation of review, suggesting that the lower barrier to entry on GitHub is now a significant liability.

## [UK offshore wind prices come in 40% cheaper than gas in record auction](https://electrek.co/2026/01/14/uk-offshore-wind-record-auction/)
**Score:** 159 | **Comments:** 96 | **ID:** 46637399

> **Article:** The article reports on a UK government auction for renewable energy contracts, where offshore wind projects secured record-low prices. The strike price for new offshore wind was set at £58.87 per megawatt-hour (MWh), which is presented as being 40% cheaper than the implied cost of new gas-fired power plants, quoted at £147/MWh. This price is locked in via a "Contract for Difference" (CfD) scheme, guaranteeing a stable revenue for wind farm operators for 20 years and providing long-term price certainty for consumers.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on the complexities of energy pricing and whether the article's headline accurately reflects the true cost and impact on consumer bills. A primary point of contention was the UK's electricity market structure, where all power is sold at the marginal price of the most expensive source needed at that moment (typically gas). Commenters debated whether this system unfairly inflates consumer costs, with one user arguing it's a rational mechanism for price discovery that incentivizes all generators to bid competitively, while others see it as a flaw that prevents consumers from directly benefiting from cheaper renewables.

The debate also touched on the validity of comparing wind and gas prices directly. Several commenters argued that such comparisons are misleading because they ignore the system-wide costs of intermittent renewables, such as the need for grid upgrades and maintaining dispatchable gas plants as backup. However, others countered that these backup costs are often overestimated, noting that idled gas plants still save significant operational costs, and that the system is designed to use them sparingly. The discussion also highlighted the role of government policy, with one user pointing out that the higher gas price figure includes a carbon tax, which another commenter defended as a necessary way to price the externality of pollution. Ultimately, the conversation revealed a deep divide: some see the auction results as a clear win for cheaper green energy, while others believe the current market and pricing models obscure the true system costs and prevent consumers from realizing the full financial benefits.

The site provides hands-on exercises that allow users to write and run eBPF code directly in the browser, aiming to lower the barrier to entry for this complex kernel technology.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response to the platform was overwhelmingly positive, with users expressing gratitude to the creator and enthusiasm for having a hands-on way to learn eBPF. Several commenters noted that they had wanted to get into eBPF but found the barrier to entry high, making this tool particularly welcome.

Beyond the initial praise, the discussion touched on two main themes:
*   **Educational Expansion:** Users suggested future content, such as lessons on deployment strategies (specifically comparing libbcc vs. CO-RE) and requests for a compiled book or PDF containing the exercises and source code.
*   **Security Concerns:** One commenter raised a critical point about the security implications of eBPF, questioning whether its innovative capabilities create a massive attack surface. They noted that the same features allowing for advanced observability could potentially be exploited by rootkits to hide malicious activity.

## [Canada slashes 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs to 6%](https://electrek.co/2026/01/16/canada-breaks-with-us-slashes-100-tariffs-chinese-evs/)
**Score:** 152 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46648778

> **Article:** Canada has announced a significant shift in its trade policy by reducing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) from 100% to 6%. This change applies to a quota of 49,000 vehicles priced at or below 35,000 CAD annually. The decision marks a departure from the previous alignment with U.S. trade protectionism and is framed as a move to diversify Canada's economy and increase consumer choice in the EV market.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was highly polarized and extended beyond the trade policy itself, focusing heavily on U.S. politics and the competitive landscape of the auto industry.

A significant portion of the conversation was politically charged. Several commenters framed the policy change as a geopolitical victory for China and a consequence of Donald Trump's influence on U.S. politics, arguing that his adversarial stance toward traditional allies like Canada is pushing them to seek economic alternatives. This sparked a brief debate about the validity of these claims, with one user challenging others to provide specifics on which "adversary" would benefit from lower tariffs.

Economically, users analyzed the scale of the tariff change. With the 49,000-vehicle quota representing roughly a quarter of Canada's current quarterly EV sales, some viewed it as a substantial market disruption, while others considered it a minor figure in the context of Canada's total population and global auto sales.

The impact on automakers, particularly Tesla, was a major theme. Some predicted this would force Tesla to compete on price, while others dismissed the idea, citing Elon Musk's focus on high-margin vehicles and his perceived detachment from market realities. There was also a strong sentiment that increased competition from Chinese manufacturers would be beneficial, forcing Western companies to innovate. Commenters noted that Chinese EVs are already technologically advanced, citing brands like Zeekr and Xpeng as examples.

Finally, there were practical concerns raised about security, with a user pointing out that similar Chinese EVs have been banned from sensitive sites in the UK over spying fears. The discussion concluded with a reminder that the policy change is symbolic of Canada's broader effort to diversify its economy in response to hostility from conventional partners.

## [On Being a Human Being in the Time of Collapse (2022) [pdf]](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/papers/crisis/crisis.pdf)
**Score:** 147 | **Comments:** 130 | **ID:** 46644962

> **Article:** The article "On Being a Human Being in the Time of Collapse" is a transcript of a lecture by computer science professor Phillip Rogaway. He argues that humanity is facing a severe, multi-faceted crisis driven by technological acceleration, environmental destruction, and political instability. Rogaway critiques the neutrality often taught in technical fields like computer science, asserting that engineers and scientists are complicit in creating harmful systems (e.g., surveillance capitalism, climate change). He calls for a rejection of nihilism and despair, urging individuals to actively "help" by refusing to work on detrimental technologies, pushing back against unethical practices within institutions, and engaging politically. The lecture serves as a moral plea for his students to recognize their agency and responsibility in a world teetering on the brink of collapse.

> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide between those who resonate with the article's urgent, pessimistic tone and those who view it as defeatist or academically arrogant. A central theme is the role of education and professional responsibility. Several commenters argue that universities should prioritize broad reflection and ethical discourse over mere job readiness, particularly in technical fields like computer science where the "why" is often neglected. This is contrasted by a strong counter-narrative from engineers who express a preference for problem-solving over dwelling on problems, viewing the lecture's outlook as "nihilistic garbage" that could demoralize students.

The conversation also explores the psychological impact of such pessimism. While some commenters find value in the lecture's call to reject neutrality and despair, others worry it fosters a sense of helplessness. The concept of "agency" is frequently discussed, with users debating whether it is better to focus on tangible, local problems (like the "dog poo dilemma") or to engage with systemic, global crises. There is a recurring sentiment that the tech industry is particularly susceptible to political apathy, with some sharing personal experiences of leaving corporate software roles due to ethical concerns about the industry's impact on society and the environment. Ultimately, the discussion balances philosophical reflection on the human condition with practical concerns about career choices and mental well-being in the face of overwhelming global challenges.

## [6-Day and IP Address Certificates Are Generally Available](https://letsencrypt.org/2026/01/15/6day-and-ip-general-availability)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 57 | **ID:** 46647491

> **Article:** Let's Encrypt has announced the general availability of 6-day and IP address certificates. The 6-day certificates are designed for ephemeral services and automated environments, requiring more frequent renewal. IP address certificates allow TLS for public IP addresses without needing a domain name, which is useful for services that don't rely on DNS. The article notes that while these certificates offer greater flexibility and automation potential, they require robust infrastructure to handle the short lifecycles and frequent renewals.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion primarily focused on the practical implications of the new certificate types, particularly regarding client support and the challenges of short lifetimes.

A major theme was the readiness of ACME clients. Users noted that while tools like `acme.sh`, `lego`, and `caddy` already support or are working on supporting IP address certificates, `certbot` does not yet support them, though a pull request is open. Several users provided workarounds using `lego` for obtaining IP certificates immediately.

The 6-day certificate lifetime sparked significant debate. While some users saw the value in short-lived certificates for ephemeral infrastructure and reducing dependency on DNS, many expressed concern about the operational burden. Critics argued that a 4-day debugging window is insufficient for enterprise environments, potentially leading to outages if automation fails. The consensus was that these short-lived certificates are highly specialized and likely unsuitable for most traditional setups, with some suggesting commercial CAs as an alternative for those needing longer validity periods.

Other topics included the use case for IP certificates (e.g., ephemeral services, anonymity), the inability to use them for localhost or private LAN devices (as they must be publicly routable), and a request for support for `.onion` addresses. There was also a minor philosophical debate about the security of IP-based validation versus DNS-based validation.

## [America could have $4 lunch bowls like Japan but for zoning laws](https://abio.substack.com/p/america-could-have-4-lunch-bowls)
**Score:** 142 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46646970

> **Article:** The article argues that America could have affordable, quick-service lunch options like Japan's $4 "kombini bento" boxes if not for restrictive zoning laws and regulations. It uses Japan's convenience store culture as a model for efficient, low-cost food service, suggesting that American regulatory hurdles—such as parking requirements, land-use restrictions, and bureaucratic red tape—prevent similar business models from thriving. The author posits that these "death by a thousand cuts" regulations stifle small businesses and drive up consumer costs.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals a multifaceted debate that extends beyond the article's focus on zoning laws. While many commenters agree that regulations are a significant barrier, several key counterpoints and complexities emerged:

*   **The Zoning vs. Rent Debate:** A central argument is that high rents, not just zoning, are the primary obstacle to $4 bowls. However, this was quickly countered by the point that zoning laws are a root cause of high land values and rents, creating a circular dependency.
*   **Economic Realities in Japan:** A highly upvoted comment challenged the article's premise by highlighting Japan's low median household income (~$25k vs. ~$83k in the US). It argued that the $4 price point is only "cheap" for foreign tourists and is sustained by low wages, not just efficient regulation. This perspective suggests that achieving such prices in the US would require a significant reduction in American wages and living standards.
*   **Labor and Exploitation:** Several users pointed out that the Japanese model relies on extremely long hours and low pay for business owners and workers, a lifestyle many Americans would be unwilling to accept. This frames the issue as a cultural and labor standards difference, not just a regulatory one.
*   **Broader Regulatory and Cultural Issues:** The conversation expanded to include other factors like commercial landlord incentives (holding properties vacant for appreciation), a lack of public engagement in local politics, and the fact that even cities without zoning laws (like Houston) or regions (Europe) don't have such cheap dining options, suggesting the problem is more complex than zoning alone.
*   **Anecdotal Evidence:** A planning commissioner provided a firsthand account, stating that voter apathy and a desire to "recreate the past" are major hurdles to reforming local zoning codes, even when changes could benefit the community economically.

## [My Gripes with Prolog](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/my-gripes-with-prolog/)
**Score:** 140 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46641348

> **Article:** The article "My Gripes with Prolog" by Hillel Wayne details his frustrations after attempting to use Prolog for a project. He identifies several key issues:
1.  **Ecosystem Fragmentation:** The lack of standardization, particularly for strings, makes code non-portable between different Prolog implementations (e.g., SWI-Prolog vs. Scryer Prolog).
2.  **Syntax and Readability:** He finds the syntax unintuitive, especially the use of `-->` for Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) and the difficulty in parsing operator precedence.
3.  **Declarative Illusion:** While Prolog appears declarative, the execution model (unification, backtracking, and the cut operator `!`) forces the programmer to think procedurally and be aware of the evaluation order to write correct and efficient code.
4.  **Counter-intuitive Semantics:** The negation-as-failure operator (`\+`) behaves unexpectedly with unbound variables, which can be confusing.
5.  **Tooling and Documentation:** He notes that documentation can be sparse and that the learning curve is steep due to the paradigm shift required.
The article concludes that while Prolog's core ideas are powerful, its practical application is hampered by these friction points.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is polarized, with many commenters defending Prolog while others share the author's frustrations. The key themes are:

*   **Defense of Prolog's Paradigm:** Several users argue that the author misunderstands Prolog's foundations. They clarify that Prolog's syntax is derived from formal logic, not traditional programming languages, and its operators (like the cut `!` and negation `\+`) have specific, logical meanings ("not provable") that are being misinterpreted. They suggest the author's issues stem from applying imperative programming mental models to a logic language.

*   **Shared Frustrations:** A significant number of commenters agree with the article's points, particularly regarding the execution model. They echo the sentiment that Prolog looks declarative but requires procedural thinking to debug and optimize, especially concerning the order of rules and the use of the cut. The fragmented ecosystem and syntax are also cited as common barriers.

*   **Author's Credibility:** There is a debate over the author's expertise. Critics label the article as the work of an "impatient newbie" who hasn't read foundational texts like "The Art of Prolog." Defenders point out that the author has written positively about Prolog before and that some gripes, like the non-standardized string handling, are valid practical concerns regardless of theoretical understanding.

*   **Resources and Alternatives:** The discussion serves as a resource list. Users recommend classic Prolog textbooks for a deeper understanding of its logical foundations. They also point to modern resources like "The Power of Prolog" and suggest related languages like Datalog and miniKanren as more accessible or better-integrated alternatives for specific use cases.
