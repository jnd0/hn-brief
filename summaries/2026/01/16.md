**Score:** 758 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46627652

> **Article:** The article links to "Creepylink.com," a satirical URL shortener that intentionally makes links look as suspicious and phishing-like as possible. Instead of shortening a URL, it appends random strings and suspicious-looking keywords (e.g., "account_verification.vbs," "install_private_video.zip," "money_request.dll") to a domain like "c1ic.link" or "web-safe.link." The site is presented as a humorous tool to highlight how deceptive URLs are constructed, rather than a functional utility.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community reacted to Creepylink with a mix of amusement and nostalgia. The primary response was humor, with users sharing the suspicious links they generated for well-known sites like Facebook, Google, and JPMorgan. Many commenters noted the irony of the tool generating actual `.zip` and `.dll` file extensions, which triggered security warnings in browsers like Firefox.

Discussion also touched on the tool's practical applications. While most viewed it purely as entertainment, one user noted that similar "fake phishing" links are used by companies to test employee security awareness. Several users compared Creepylink to "Shadyurl," a defunct predecessor that was praised for its variety of suspicious domains. Finally, there was a minor side-discussion about the relaunch of Digg, the platform where the article was originally discovered.

**Score:** 582 | **Comments:** 746 | **ID:** 46633378

> **Article:** The article from 404 Media reports on a Palantir application, "Immigration OS," being used by ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to coordinate raids in Minneapolis. The software aggregates vast amounts of data—including location tracking, license plate readers, and biometric data—to identify and target neighborhoods for enforcement operations. The piece highlights the increasing militarization and technological sophistication of immigration enforcement, noting that these tools allow for rapid, data-driven operations that impact local communities. It also references Palantir CEO Alex Karp's public support for the administration's immigration policies.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Palantir, ICE, and the broader use of surveillance technology by the government. Commenters express alarm that the tactics and tools deployed against immigrant populations represent a slippery slope toward authoritarianism for all citizens, frequently invoking historical parallels to the Stasi or Gestapo. There is significant debate regarding the timeline of Palantir's involvement with ICE, with some noting that while the technology has been used for years, the current administration's aggressive enforcement tactics have escalated its impact.

A major theme is the moral culpability of the technology sector. Users debate whether the blame lies with software developers—who are accused of prioritizing high salaries over ethics—or with business executives and a failing political system that enables these contracts. The discussion also touches on the lack of widespread civil unrest in the U.S. compared to other democracies, with international commenters expressing confusion and dismay at American passivity in the face of what they describe as clear authoritarian overreach. The conversation concludes with a grim acknowledgment that the "surveillance state" predicted by privacy advocates for decades is now a reality, facilitated by Silicon Valley.

## [Apple is fighting for TSMC capacity as Nvidia takes center stage](https://www.culpium.com/p/exclusiveapple-is-fighting-for-tsmc)
**Score:** 566 | **Comments:** 344 | **ID:** 46633488

> **Article:** The article reports that Apple is in a competitive struggle with Nvidia for TSMC's advanced manufacturing capacity. While Apple has historically been TSMC's largest and most stable customer, Nvidia's explosive growth in the AI sector has made it a dominant force, potentially displacing Apple from its top position. The piece explores the tension between Apple's need for consistent, long-term supply for its iPhones and Nvidia's demand for cutting-edge nodes for its GPUs. It also touches on Apple's potential strategies to diversify its manufacturing partners, such as Intel, to mitigate risks associated with its reliance on TSMC.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is multifaceted, with commenters analyzing the business dynamics, criticizing the article's tone, and speculating on future geopolitical risks.

A central theme is the debate over whether this situation constitutes "karma" for Apple, which has long been TSMC's primary customer. Some users see it as poetic justice, while others argue it's simply standard business, noting that TSMC, not Apple, makes the final decisions on capacity allocation. The conversation then shifts to the strategic value of each customer. Commenters characterize Apple as a stable, long-term anchor tenant that provides predictable revenue, contrasting it with Nvidia, which is seen as a high-frequency, high-volume customer capitalizing on the current AI boom. This leads to speculation about the future; some wonder if Apple's stability will give it pricing power again if the AI investment cycle slows, while others point out that in the short term, TSMC's foundry model is an auction where the highest bidder wins.

Several comments focus on Apple's potential responses. Many suggest that Apple will be forced to diversify its manufacturing base, with Intel and Samsung being named as potential alternatives. There is a consensus that building its own fab is impractical for Apple, despite its immense resources, due to the immense cost and complexity involved.

The discussion also takes a sharp turn into geopolitical risk, with a significant thread about the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. One commenter argues that the US would be unable to prevent it due to China's superior manufacturing and missile capacity, predicting the US would concede in exchange for supply agreements.

Finally, a notable portion of the comments criticize the article's writing style. Several users find the reporting to be overly dramatized and personalized, describing it as "clickbait" and a "novel" rather than a straightforward analysis of technology and finance.

## [25 Years of Wikipedia](https://wikipedia25.org)
**Score:** 430 | **Comments:** 365 | **ID:** 46632023

> **Article:** The article links to a commemorative website, wikipedia25.org, celebrating the 25th anniversary of Wikipedia. The site features historical content, such as the story of Wikipedia's first day, and highlights contributions from its founders, notably Jimmy Wales.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on Wikipedia's 25th anniversary is multifaceted, balancing praise for its impact with significant criticism of its current operations and future challenges.

A primary point of contention is the organization's fundraising. Several users expressed frustration with the frequent donation campaigns, arguing that the Wikimedia Foundation's large endowment should be sufficient to cover the core costs of running Wikipedia. The criticism extends to the use of funds for "off-mission" initiatives, with some commenters suggesting that donors might be unaware of how their money is being spent. This led to a discussion about whether a viable competitor could emerge, allowing users to protest through their donations.

The historical narrative of Wikipedia itself was scrutinized. One commenter pointed out that the official anniversary site omits co-founder Larry Sanger, providing a detailed account of his critical role in Wikipedia's early development, from coining the name to establishing its policies. This omission was cited by some as an example of Wikipedia's own potential for bias and historical revisionism.

Concerns about the platform's quality and future were also prominent. Some users worried that Wikipedia's content quality is declining, particularly on politically charged topics, where they perceive a growing partisan slant and erosion of neutrality policies. Others, however, defended the platform's stability, citing official statistics that show steady edit and visitation rates, countering predictions of a decline similar to that of Stack Overflow. The discussion also touched upon the site's technical aspects, with one user humorously critiquing its complex page layout.

Finally, the conversation looked toward future challenges and innovations. The potential impact of AI and LLMs was a recurring theme, both as a tool for tasks like translation and as a potential alternative to visiting the site directly. However, the limitations of machine translation were noted, leading to a discussion about "Abstract Wikipedia"—an official project to create a language-independent, structural representation of content that could be rendered into multiple languages, avoiding the pitfalls of purely automated translation. The discussion concluded with broader concerns about Wikipedia's vulnerability as a single entity in an increasingly politically unstable and censorious world, highlighting the need for robust, decentralized archival and recovery plans.

## [Ask HN: How can we solve the loneliness epidemic?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46635345)
**Score:** 388 | **Comments:** 692 | **ID:** 46635345

> **Question:** The user "publicdebates" asks the Hacker News community for solutions to the loneliness epidemic. They share a personal anecdote about childhood trauma hindering their social skills and describe an unconventional coping mechanism they've developed: conducting public surveys in a city to connect with strangers. They ask for new ideas to reach isolated individuals who feel unable to connect with others.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion offers a mix of personal anecdotes, sociological analysis, and skepticism regarding the scale of the problem.

Several users shared personal experiences that contextualized the problem. One user detailed their own history of trauma and social anxiety, explaining that their public surveying project was born from loneliness and has provided unexpected connections. Another user described feeling "untethered" after a divorce, expressing hopelessness about finding community in a society they view as corroded and socially poisoned. Conversely, a "tail-end boomer" argued that previous generations were forced into social interactions (shopping, playing in public) and had to "find their voice" to overcome isolation, suggesting the responsibility lies with the individual to build confidence.

Solutions and theories on causation varied:
*   **Structural and Environmental Fixes:** Some suggested reviving physical social structures like community lodges (Elks/Moose) or creating hyper-local social networks to reduce online disinhibition. Others noted that modern conveniences allow people to avoid public spaces entirely, meaning socializing now requires deliberate effort rather than being a necessity.
*   **Low-Stakes Interaction:** A recurring theme was the difficulty of "breaking the ice." One user praised the original poster's survey method for normalizing low-stakes interactions where participants can walk away at any time. Another suggested simple, public hobbies like playing guitar on a front step to invite conversation naturally.
*   **Online vs. Offline:** While some argued for the necessity of physical community, others defended online spaces as valid sources of connection, though they noted the threat of LLM-generated content eroding trust.

Finally, there was a debate over the severity of the epidemic. One commenter cited Gallup poll data suggesting 81% of Americans are satisfied with their personal lives, questioning the narrative of a widespread crisis. However, others countered that this number is historically low and that "satisfaction" is distinct from deep connection, with one user warning against the "just stop being depressed" energy of dismissing the issue.

## [‘ELITE’: The Palantir app ICE uses to find neighborhoods to raid](https://werd.io/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/)
**Score:** 352 | **Comments:** 308 | **ID:** 46637127

> **Article:** The linked article by "Werd" details a Palantir application named "ELITE" that is reportedly used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The app is designed to aggregate and analyze data to identify specific neighborhoods for immigration raids. The article frames the technology as a tool enabling targeted enforcement operations, raising concerns about privacy, surveillance, and the role of big tech in government enforcement activities.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is multifaceted, with commenters debating the technology's capabilities, the ethics of its use, and the broader political context.

A significant portion of the debate centers on the nature of Palantir's technology. Some users dismiss the app as a standard "enterprise dashboard" or a "consultancy with a map," arguing that the real issue is not the software's sophistication but the policy decisions driving its use. Others counter that the presentation of "probabilistic information" is dangerous, especially when used by agents with minimal training, and will inevitably lead to wrongful arrests and civil rights violations.

Ethical responsibility is a major theme. Commenters are divided on whether the blame lies with Palantir or its government clients. One side argues that Palantir is a private entity enabling government overreach, effectively skirting regulations. The other side contends that the government is the ultimate customer and decision-maker, and that Palantir is simply a vendor fulfilling a contract. This leads to discussions about the moral culpability of engineers working on such products, with some invoking the "just following orders" defense as insufficient.

The conversation also branches into broader political and social commentary. Users debate the scale and morality of deportations under different administrations, with some arguing that current tactics are uniquely cruel and unconstitutional. There are references to the technology being "beta-tested" on Palestinians and the concept of the "imperial boomerang," where tactics honed abroad are eventually used domestically. The overall sentiment is highly critical of both Palantir and the government agencies using its products, with many commenters expressing disillusionment with the tech industry's direction.

## [To those who fired or didn't hire tech writers because of AI](https://passo.uno/letter-those-who-fired-tech-writers-ai/)
**Score:** 322 | **Comments:** 231 | **ID:** 46629474

> **Article:** The article is a letter addressed to companies that have fired or declined to hire technical writers in favor of AI. It argues that this is a profound mistake, equating it to firing a pilot because autopilot exists. The author contends that the true value of a technical writer is not merely in the act of writing, but in their role as an empathetic observer and a bridge between different groups (engineers, product managers, and users). They emphasize that tech writers act as the "first user," identifying usability problems and clarifying complex concepts in a way that AI, which lacks genuine understanding and the ability to experience a product, cannot. The piece warns that relying on AI will lead to a degradation of documentation quality, creating a "legal and user experience catastrophe" for companies, while the best companies will continue to value human tech writers who use AI as a tool, not a replacement.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals a sharp divide on the future of technical writing in the age of AI. Several distinct themes emerge from the debate.

A significant portion of the comments defend the irreplaceable value of skilled human tech writers, echoing the article's core message. These users argue that the best tech writers are not just scribes but "anthropologists" who bridge communication gaps between engineering, product, and users. They act as the first user, providing invaluable feedback on usability and flagging issues that product managers might miss. Commenters like `nicbou` and `drob518` stress that this role requires empathy, real-world investigation, and building relationships to gather information—capabilities AI currently lacks.

However, a strong counter-argument questions the quality and value of human-written documentation. Some commenters, like `murderfs`, share negative experiences, claiming they've rarely seen documentation from tech writers that was worth reading and that it often contained inaccuracies similar to AI hallucinations. This skepticism is bolstered by the view that many companies prioritize cost-cutting over quality. `Nextgrid` points out that in markets with little competition, "good enough" documentation from AI is a financially attractive option, even if it's a poor replacement.

A more pragmatic, forward-looking perspective suggests that AI will transform the role rather than eliminate it entirely. `aurareturn` and `NitpickLawyer` propose a future where one tech writer uses AI to scale their output, making a single person as productive as a former team of five. `NitpickLawyer` argues that AI's "hallucination" problem is solvable with agentic workflows and that it will soon match or exceed the quality of average human-written docs. The debate also touches on the broader implications of AI, with some commenters expressing concern about the loss of human skills and the homogenizing effect of LLM-generated text, while others see it as an inevitable technological progression.

## [Raspberry Pi's New AI Hat Adds 8GB of RAM for Local LLMs](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/raspberry-pi-ai-hat-2/)
**Score:** 237 | **Comments:** 194 | **ID:** 46629682

> **Article:** The article, by Jeff Geerling, reviews the Raspberry Pi AI Kit, which includes a HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) featuring a Hailo 10H AI accelerator. The kit is marketed to enable local AI processing, particularly for LLMs, on a Raspberry Pi 5. Geerling's review is largely critical. He finds that the performance of the Hailo 10H is underwhelming, noting that the Raspberry Pi 5's built-in CPU can sometimes outperform the dedicated accelerator for certain tasks. He also points out significant software and driver issues, with examples not yet updated for the new hardware and a lack of support for non-Raspberry Pi OS distributions. Ultimately, he concludes that the product feels like a marketing-driven attempt to jump on the "AI" bandwagon rather than a genuinely useful tool for most users.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is overwhelmingly skeptical and critical of the new Raspberry Pi AI HAT. The consensus is that the product is a solution in search of a problem, representing a misstep for a company once known for its clear purpose and innovation.

A primary theme is the perceived lack of a compelling use case. Commenters argue that running local LLMs on a Pi with 8GB of RAM is impractical and offers a poor user experience. They contend that the hardware is underpowered for meaningful LLM tasks and that the "AI" label is a case of marketing hype shoehorned into a product where it doesn't belong.

Many participants express a broader disappointment with Raspberry Pi's recent direction. They feel the company has lost its original "magic" and is now merely following trends in a crowded SBC (Single Board Computer) market where cheaper Chinese alternatives often provide better value. Several commenters suggest that for the price of a new Pi 5, one could acquire a much more powerful used laptop, and for embedded GPIO projects, a far cheaper ESP32 is more suitable. This has led to the perception that Raspberry Pi's primary market is now commercial/industrial users, who value its reliability and support over consumer-grade alternatives.

Technical criticism of the HAT itself is also prominent. The Hailo 10H accelerator is described as having "laughable" performance and poor software support, with one user detailing the "significant shenanigans" required to get it working on a standard Linux distribution. The lack of reliable drivers and compatibility beyond the official Pi OS was a major point of frustration.

Finally, the discussion touched on potential niche applications. While general LLM use was dismissed, some suggested that fine-tuned, tiny models could be useful for specific tasks like a natural language smart home interface. However, even this was met with skepticism, with commenters questioning the need for such hardware when simpler, more established computer vision techniques are already sufficient for many applications.

## [UK offshore wind prices come in 40% cheaper than gas in record auction](https://electrek.co/2026/01/14/uk-offshore-wind-record-auction/)
**Score:** 144 | **Comments:** 82 | **ID:** 46637399

> **Article:** The article from Electrek reports on a UK government auction for renewable energy contracts, where offshore wind projects secured record-low prices. The key figure is a "strike price" of £58/MWh for wind, which is presented as being 40% cheaper than the estimated £91/MWh cost of generating electricity from gas-fired power plants. The article frames this as a major milestone, demonstrating that new offshore wind is now significantly more cost-effective than fossil fuel alternatives for generating electricity in the UK.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion is highly critical of the article's framing and the underlying energy market mechanics, with several distinct themes emerging.

A central point of contention is the UK's electricity pricing system. Multiple users explain that the UK uses a marginal pricing model, where the price of all electricity sold on the grid is set by the most expensive source needed to meet demand at any given moment (typically gas). This means that even when cheap wind power constitutes the majority of the energy mix, consumers still pay the high gas price for all of it. Commenters debate whether this is an "insane" system that unfairly enriches renewable producers or a necessary mechanism for price discovery and ensuring sufficient investment.

The discussion also delves into the true cost of energy, challenging the article's direct comparison. Several commenters argue that the article's figures are misleading because:
*   The gas price comparison includes a government carbon tax, making the raw cost of gas appear higher.
*   The wind price is a subsidized "strike price" locked in for 20 years via a Contract for Difference (CfD).
*   The comparison ignores significant system-level costs associated with wind power, such as grid upgrades and the need for backup or storage to manage intermittency.

Finally, there is a debate about the nature of intermittency and its costs. One commenter suggests that intermittent sources should face a price penalty to reflect their unreliability. However, others counter that the existing "capacity market" mechanism is designed to compensate dispatchable power plants (like gas) for being available as backup, thus addressing this issue. The conversation also touches on the feasibility of demand-side management (e.g., dynamic pricing) as a solution, with one user arguing it's viable by citing historical examples from France, while another implies it's not widely practiced in the UK.

Sprites are described as hardware-isolated Linux shells with durable storage that can be spun up in about 1.5 seconds. They are built on Fly.io's existing infrastructure (Fly Machines) but are designed for ephemeral, interactive workloads. The core technical innovation highlighted is the state management system: rather than relying on a centralized relational database for global state, Sprites use a "multiple SQLite database" design. Each organization gets its own SQLite database, which is synchronized to object storage using Litestream.io. This architecture aims to provide high scalability and low-latency access to state by keeping the database close to the compute resources.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion on Hacker News was multifaceted, ranging from deep technical curiosity to critiques of the product's current state.

**Technical Architecture and Implementation:**
A significant portion of the conversation focused on the underlying architecture. Fly.io engineer tptacek elaborated on the global orchestrator design, noting that while Fly Machines keep the source of truth decentralized at the physical machine level, global state (apps, organizations) is typically stored in Postgres. For Sprites, they moved this global state to object storage backed by individual SQLite databases per organization, synchronized with Litestream. This approach was praised as a robust design pattern that is often overlooked. chrismccord further explained how they use Elixir and Phoenix to manage this distributed system, allowing RPC calls to execute code on the node where the specific SQLite database resides, effectively treating a remote database as a local resource while minimizing network hops.

**User Experience and Product Maturity:**
Opinions on the current user experience were mixed. Several users, including MrOrelliOReilly and el_nahual, criticized the lack of polish, sparse documentation, and unintuitive CLI. MrOrelliOReilly noted that while the speed is impressive, the lack of pre-configured base images for development (especially for agentic coding with Claude) requires significant setup. tptacek acknowledged these issues, stating that the team's philosophy is to ship early and iterate, preferring not to wait until the product is perfectly polished. Conversely, other users like roywiggins shared positive experiences, using Sprites to run development environments like OpenCode directly from a phone via Termux.

**Use Cases and Comparisons:**
Users explored various use cases, primarily centered on rapid, isolated development environments. The ability to spin up a full Linux environment with a public URL and HTTPS in seconds was highlighted as a key advantage over traditional VPS setups. Comparisons were drawn to other sandboxing solutions like E2B. There was also some confusion regarding the name "Sprites," with some commenters expecting a discussion on 2D game graphics, though others noted the term is still widely used in that context.

**Practical Issues and Feedback:**
Several users reported practical issues. raro11 mentioned a bug where sprites failed to suspend properly, which chrismccord confirmed and stated was being fixed. Questions were raised about file transfer methods, with tptacek mentioning a new FS API and suggesting magic-wormhole as a workaround until CLI support is added. There was also a brief, flagged comment criticizing the product as "US-centric," which was refuted by tptacek.

## [Found: Medieval Cargo Ship – Largest Vessel of Its Kind Ever](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/archaeologists-say-theyve-unearthed-a-massive-medieval-cargo-ship-thats-the-largest-vessel-of-its-kind-ever-found-180987984/)
**Score:** 122 | **Comments:** 27 | **ID:** 46633574

> **Article:** Archaeologists have discovered the largest medieval cargo ship ever found in the Øresund strait between Denmark and Sweden. The vessel, identified as a cog—a type of single-masted ship used by the Hanseatic League—measures 27 meters long and is remarkably well-preserved due to the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. The ship's construction reveals a sophisticated supply chain, with planks made of Pomeranian oak (modern-day Poland) and a frame from Dutch timber. Researchers highlight the discovery of a "castle" structure on the stern, providing the first physical evidence of a feature previously known only from historical records. The ship dates to the late medieval period, likely the 14th century.
>
> **Discussion:** The commenters on Hacker News approached the discovery with a mix of historical curiosity, technical observation, and typical forum tangents. The discussion can be categorized into several key themes:

**Historical and Technical Context**
Users quickly sought to understand the ship's significance. Several commenters provided context regarding the Hanseatic League's extensive trade networks, noting the economic feasibility of transporting timber across the North Sea and Baltic Sea. There was a specific focus on the ship's design (a cog) and its limitations compared to later vessels like carracks. Users also discussed the preservation conditions in the Baltic Sea, attributing the ship's survival to the brackish water which inhibits the wood-boring organisms found in saltwater.

**Scientific Sources and Media Quality**
A significant portion of the discussion critiqued the source article (from *Smithsonian Magazine*) rather than the discovery itself. Users complained about aggressive video pop-ups and mobile ad layouts, debating the sustainability of ad-supported models for niche scientific journalism. In response to these frustrations, several users bypassed the secondary article to link directly to primary sources, including the official press release from the Viking Ship Museum and a Danish documentary.

**Comparative Archaeology**
The discovery prompted comparisons to other famous shipwrecks. The Vasa (a later, but famously preserved Swedish warship) was frequently mentioned as a point of reference for maritime preservation and museum displays.

**Tangents and Pop Culture**
As is common on HN, the comments included lighter tangents. One user reminisced about the ship-building mechanics in the classic video game *Patrician II/III*, while another offered a linguistic note on the etymology of the word "forecastle."

## [Show HN: TinyCity – A tiny city SIM for MicroPython (Thumby micro console)](https://github.com/chrisdiana/TinyCity)
**Score:** 117 | **Comments:** 19 | **ID:** 46632768

> **Project:** TinyCity is a miniature city simulation game designed for the Thumby micro console, built using MicroPython. The project is a self-contained "tiny city SIM" that runs on the Thumby's small 72x40 monochrome OLED display. The source code is available on GitHub, and the developer is working on an interface layer to abstract Thumby-specific functionality, with the goal of eventually running the game on other MicroPython/Python platforms. An online version is also in development, pending a pull request to merge into the Arcade repository.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was overwhelmingly positive, with users describing the project as "neat," "cool," and "awesome." Several commenters expressed excitement about the technical challenge of fitting a city simulator onto such a constrained device, with one user humorously hoping the game "Reticulates Tiny Splines" (a reference to *SimCity 2000*), which the developer plans to implement.

A more technical discussion emerged regarding the game's economic simulation. A user identified a bug where residential population is double-counted for taxes while industrial population is ignored. The developer clarified that this was an intentional design choice inspired by another project, MicroCity, to balance early-game cash flow and encourage residential zoning. While this makes the economy more forgiving for new players, it also skews the balance away from industrial and commercial impacts and can make difficulty tuning inconsistent.

Other topics included:
- **Platform specifics:** Confirmation that the game targets the Thumby's 72x40 display, with plans for broader platform compatibility.
- **User serendipity:** One user noted they had just purchased a Thumby, making the post timely for them.
- **Autocorrect issue:** A user pointed out that "SIM" was autocorrected from "sim" (simulator) in the post title, which the developer confirmed.

## [French Court Orders Popular VPNs to Block More Pirate Sites, Despite Opposition](https://torrentfreak.com/french-court-orders-popular-vpns-to-block-more-pirate-sites-despite-opposition/)
**Score:** 112 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46632004

> **Article:** A French court has ordered several popular VPN providers, including NordVPN and Surfshark, to block access to pirate streaming sites for users within France. The ruling, reported by TorrentFreak, came after a lawsuit from French football league Ligue 1. The VPNs argued against the order, citing their "no-log" policies which prevent them from tracking user locations to enforce geo-blocking, and noting that only ProtonVPN did not appear in court to argue a defense. Despite their opposition, the court mandated the providers implement the blocks.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion on the French court ruling covers a wide range of topics, from the technical feasibility of blocking to broader political and philosophical debates.

A significant portion of the conversation focused on the technical effectiveness and potential overreach of court-ordered internet censorship. Users pointed to the recent case in Spain where Cloudflare's DNS service (1.1.1.1) was fined for not implementing blocks, highlighting that authorities are moving beyond simple DNS blocking to more aggressive IP-level blocking. This led to a debate on whether such measures are a "distraction" until more robust censorship methods are adopted.

The discussion also took a political turn, with some commenters linking the ruling to a perceived decline in transatlantic alliances and the EU's independent legislative capacity. This was countered by others who argued the EU is fully capable of creating its own "bullshit," citing the "chat control" proposal as an example. The conversation then broadened to a debate on the role of founding documents versus political culture in protecting liberty, with some arguing that US-style constitutional protections are unique and vital, while others countered that a culture hostile to power is more important than any written law.

Several commenters questioned the economic motivations behind the ruling, with one user explaining that media and entertainment, particularly top-tier football (soccer) leagues like Ligue 1, are massive revenue generators in countries like France, making piracy a significant domestic economic issue.

Finally, there was a specific discussion about the VPN providers' "no-log" defense. Users debated how a VPN could enforce geo-blocking without violating its privacy promises, with one suggesting zero-knowledge cryptography as a potential, though technically challenging, solution. The fact that ProtonVPN was the only provider not to appear in court was noted as "ominous" by one user, though others questioned the significance of this detail.
