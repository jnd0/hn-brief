## [France dumps Zoom and Teams as Europe seeks digital autonomy from the US](https://apnews.com/article/europe-digital-sovereignty-big-tech-9f5388b68a0648514cebc8d92f682060)
**Score:** 823 | **Comments:** 450 | **ID:** 46873294

> **Article:** France is moving away from US-based collaboration tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, part of a broader European push for "digital sovereignty." The government is not just adopting existing open-source software but is actively developing its own suite of applications, known as "La Suite." This new platform, built with a Django backend and React frontend, is being released under the permissive MIT license and its code is publicly available on GitHub. The effort aims to create a trusted, sovereign digital infrastructure for government use, reducing reliance on American tech giants.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation quickly pivoted from the technical details of France's software stack to a broader, and often heated, debate on geopolitical and economic responsibility. A primary point of contention was the blame for Europe's tech dependency, with some commenters arguing that European voters and leaders are responsible for decades of inaction, while others pointed directly to US political decisions as the catalyst. Technical insights revealed that while the French government is building its own software, some components, like the Grist spreadsheet, are open-source tools from US-based companies, complicating the narrative of complete decoupling. There was also a practical discussion about the user experience of US software, with some defending Microsoft Teams as a functional tool, while others expressed deep frustration with it. Underlying the entire thread was a sense that this move, while symbolic, highlights a growing global fragmentation of the internet and technology landscape.

## [What's up with all those equals signs anyway?](https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2026/02/02/whats-up-with-all-those-equals-signs-anyway/)
**Score:** 615 | **Comments:** 180 | **ID:** 46868759

> **Article:** The article analyzes the appearance of "equals signs" in leaked emails from the Epstein case, tracing the issue to a mishandling of the Quoted-Printable (QP) email encoding standard. It explains that when converting line endings from Windows-style (CRLF) to Unix-style (LF), a necessary space character was likely stripped from the soft line break sequence "=\r\n". This corrupted the QP decoding, causing the encoding markers themselves to be displayed as literal text in the final documents. The author demonstrates this by manually replicating the error, showing how a simple find-and-replace operation can break the complex email formatting standard.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation centers on the technical incompetence revealed by the "equals sign" error, with users universally agreeing it exemplifies the danger of having "just enough knowledge to be dangerous." Many commenters draw a direct parallel to the famous Stack Overflow answer about parsing HTML with regex, arguing that both cases involve attempting to handle structured data with naive text manipulation tools. A significant technical debate emerged regarding the underlying causes, with some users focusing on the SMTP protocol's line-length limits and CRLF vs. LF differences, while others defended the Quoted-Printable encoding system itself, arguing it's a necessary standard for transporting binary data over legacy systems. Several participants expressed broader frustration with the complexity of email standards like MIME, sharing personal anecdotes about the difficulty of writing robust email clients. The discussion also expanded into the procedural failures of evidence handling, with one user providing a detailed explanation of how low-level interns and poor processes in legal settings often lead to the mangling of digital evidence, suggesting this is a systemic issue rather than a one-off mistake.

## [Qwen3-Coder-Next](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-coder-next)
**Score:** 594 | **Comments:** 370 | **ID:** 46872706

> **Article:** The Qwen AI blog post announces the release of Qwen3-Coder-Next, a new open-weights model designed for coding tasks. The model is available in a 48.4GB GGUF format, making it suitable for high-end laptops and local deployment. It claims to achieve performance close to Sonnet 4.5 on coding benchmarks while using only 3B active parameters. The release includes resources like a guide for using it with local coding agents and tools like Unsloth for optimized deployment.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation quickly pivoted from the model's release to broader debates about the viability and definition of local AI. A central theme was frustration with closed providers, particularly Anthropic, which several users cited for banning accounts or restricting tool usage, prompting a renewed interest in open alternatives. Technical discussions focused on the practicalities of running large models locally, with users sharing performance benchmarks on specific hardware (like a Radeon RX 7900 XTX) and debating the true cost of "local" versus cloud API expenses, especially for high-volume agent tasks. While some were excited by the model's claimed efficiency, others expressed skepticism, noting that real-world coding performance didn't yet match frontier models like Sonnet 4.5. The debate also touched on the future of AI hardware, with some arguing that consumer hardware will eventually catch up to run capable models, while others countered that open-weight models will always lag behind the frontier due to the immense cost of training state-of-the-art systems.

## [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home)
**Score:** 395 | **Comments:** 215 | **ID:** 46871173

> **Article:** The article at agentskills.io introduces a standardized format for defining "skills" for AI agents, which are essentially reusable, modular instructions that agents can reference to perform specific tasks. The proposal aims to improve agent performance and context management by providing a structured way to organize and share capabilities. It suggests a folder-based system with specific metadata, positioning these skills as a temporary but necessary solution in the current state of AI development. The article is part of a broader effort to create conventions for agent capabilities, as evidenced by the linked huggingface/upskill evaluation project.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News conversation reveals a deep divide over the value of formalizing agent skills. A central debate pits the "bitter lesson" philosophy—which argues that scaling general models will eventually render specialized formats obsolete—against the practical reality of current context window limitations. Proponents argue that skills are a crucial, temporary workaround for managing context in large codebases, with one user noting that without them, "we wouldn't have any context left for coding." Skeptics, however, dismiss the standardized format as an unnecessary "hack" that will soon be obsolete, questioning why good documentation in plain English isn't sufficient. The discussion also highlights practical challenges, such as agents often failing to use skills unless explicitly prompted, and draws comparisons to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with some seeing skills as a simplified alternative while others view them as fundamentally different in purpose. A broader, more philosophical point emerged, suggesting that building agent-friendly skills forces developers to improve the usability and documentation of their own tools, making products better for human users as a side effect.

## [Deno Sandbox](https://deno.com/blog/introducing-deno-sandbox)
**Score:** 353 | **Comments:** 122 | **ID:** 46874097

> **Article:** Deno has introduced a new "Deno Sandbox" product designed to securely run untrusted, LLM-generated code. The solution provides lightweight Linux microVMs within the Deno Deploy cloud, offering controlled network egress and isolated execution environments. A key security feature is the handling of secrets, where API keys are replaced with placeholders in the code and only materialized when making outbound requests to approved hosts. This prevents code from exfiltrating credentials, though it does not stop the code from using the secrets for their intended purpose.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community engaged in a detailed technical debate regarding the security model of Deno Sandbox's secret management. While the placeholder approach was generally seen as clever for preventing permanent credential theft, some users questioned its robustness, arguing that an attacker could potentially exploit an approved API endpoint that echoes back input to retrieve the secret. Others suggested that a proxy aware of the request context could be a safer alternative. The conversation also highlighted the broader market trend, with a user listing numerous competing sandboxing products targeting the AI agent execution space, prompting a defense of the market's demand and viability. Additionally, the discussion touched on concerns over vendor lock-in and whether the microVMs could be self-hosted, as well as a notable side-debate about whether the announcement article was AI-generated, which a Deno team member firmly denied.

## [Data centers in space makes no sense](https://civai.org/blog/space-data-centers)
**Score:** 324 | **Comments:** 451 | **ID:** 46876105

> **Article:** The article argues that placing data centers in space is impractical, primarily due to the immense difficulty of dissipating heat in a vacuum where only radiation is possible. It contends that the thermodynamic challenges make terrestrial locations like the Arctic far more sensible for computing infrastructure. The piece also suggests that proposals like this may serve as strategic distractions or legal maneuvers rather than viable technological solutions. Ultimately, the author concludes that the concept is not a useful source of computing power and is likely to disappoint those who invest in it.
>
> **Discussion:** Debate centered on the fundamental physics of cooling in space, with users challenging the assumption that the vacuum makes heat dissipation easy. While some argued that radiative cooling is inefficient and would require massive, heavy surfaces, others countered that raising radiator temperatures and using advanced materials could mitigate these issues. A key technical insight emerged from comparing the proposal to Starlink, with one user calculating that the existing constellation already manages roughly 50MW of power dissipation, though critics noted this is a tiny fraction of global data center energy use and that adding compute hardware faces strict power and latency constraints. The conversation also explored non-technical motivations, with speculation that the idea is a sci-fi-inspired fantasy for creating a sovereign space fiefdom or a strategic distraction to sabotage competitors. Security and practicality were questioned, as orbital assets are vulnerable to kinetic attacks and radiation, while a few defended the concept as a step toward humanity's multi-planetary survival.

## [X offices raided in France](https://apnews.com/article/france-x-investigation-seach-elon-musk-1116be84d84201011219086ecfd4e0bc)
**Score:** 285 | **Comments:** 14 | **ID:** 46872894

> **Article:** French authorities raided the offices of the social media platform X as part of an ongoing investigation. The raids were conducted by prosecutors, with the specific details of the investigation's focus not fully detailed in the linked report. The action represents a significant escalation in regulatory scrutiny of the company within the European Union. This event follows a pattern of increased legal challenges for X in various international jurisdictions.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation centered on clarifying the unique structure of the French legal system to provide context for the raids. A top comment explained that French investigations are led by an independent "juge d'instruction" (investigating magistrate) who is separate from the "procureur" (state prosecutor), a distinction designed to prevent executive branch overreach. Users debated the specific mechanics of this system, with one user seeking a detailed walkthrough comparing it to the US system to understand how a hypothetical burglary case would proceed. Other commenters corrected the article's title, noting that X did not raid the prosecutors' offices, but rather the prosecutors raided X. Technical confusion arose in side threads regarding the platform's name, with some users humorously referring to it as "not.X" or clarifying that "X" refers to Twitter.

## [New York’s budget bill would require “blocking technology” on all 3D printers](https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/02/03/new-york-wants-to-ctrlaltdelete-your-3d-printer/)
**Score:** 282 | **Comments:** 319 | **ID:** 46872540

> **Article:** A New York budget bill proposes requiring "blocking technology" on all 3D printers to prevent the creation of firearms, as reported by Adafruit. The legislation would extend beyond additive manufacturing to include CNC mills and any machine capable of making three-dimensional modifications from digital designs. The article references the case of Dexter Taylor, who is serving a 10-year sentence in NYC for manufacturing firearms without a license. The proposal aims to stop the production of "ghost guns" through technical restrictions on manufacturing equipment.
>
> **Discussion:** The community overwhelmingly criticized the proposal as technologically illiterate and ineffective security theater. Many argued that criminals already obtain guns through existing illegal channels, and that 3D-printed firearms remain unreliable and impractical compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Technical experts pointed out the impossibility of creating algorithms that can accurately distinguish gun parts from benign objects like toy props or tool inserts, with one commenter noting that even a PVC pipe could be interpreted as a gun barrel. The discussion highlighted broader concerns about regulatory overreach, with fears that such laws could eventually restrict legitimate repair and hobbyist activities, similar to how printer watermarking for currency detection became standard despite privacy concerns. Several commenters emphasized that New York residents could simply drive to neighboring states to purchase firearms legally, making the proposed restrictions largely symbolic. The conversation also touched on constitutional issues, with some noting that banning firearms entirely would require a constitutional amendment, while others drew parallels to tax enforcement on activities like liquor distillation.

## [Floppinux – An Embedded Linux on a Single Floppy, 2025 Edition](https://krzysztofjankowski.com/floppinux/floppinux-2025.html)
**Score:** 234 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46866544

> **Article:** The article "Floppinux – An Embedded Linux on a Single Floppy, 2025 Edition" details a project to run a modern Linux system from a single 1.44MB floppy disk. It uses antiX 23 i386 as a base, which is stripped down to fit within the tight storage constraints, leaving 253KB of free space. The author employs a clever persistence method using a bind mount to a home directory on the floppy's FAT12 filesystem to save space. The project also notes a specific technical limitation, as the Linux kernel drops i486 support in version 6.15, making 6.14 the latest compatible version.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation quickly pivoted from the specific project to the broader feasibility of reviving old 32-bit hardware. A primary point of debate was whether 32-bit software is still viable; while one user lamented the lack of maintained 32-bit packages and video drivers, another countered that Debian 12 still has a fully supported i386 port. A nostalgic tangent emerged around the enduring usability of 1990s software, particularly Microsoft Office 97, with users debating its feature set and user interface compared to modern equivalents. Technical discussions focused on the reliability of the FAT12 filesystem for persistence, with some arguing for the risks of non-journaling media and others defending FAT's long-standing use in embedded systems. The thread was also filled with reminiscences of historical floppy-based distributions like QNX, Puppy Linux, and Damn Small Linux, alongside ongoing searches for lightweight Linux solutions for legacy machines like a 386SX.

## [Prek: A better, faster, drop-in pre-commit replacement, engineered in Rust](https://github.com/j178/prek)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46873138

> **Article:** The article introduces Prek, a new tool written in Rust that serves as a high-performance, drop-in replacement for the popular `pre-commit` framework. It aims to improve upon the original Python-based tool by offering significantly faster execution and better handling of large monorepos. The project claims full compatibility with existing `pre-commit` configurations, allowing users to switch without rewriting their hook definitions. The core value proposition is reducing the friction and waiting time associated with running linting and formatting checks before committing code.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation quickly evolved into a broader debate about the fundamental utility and user experience of client-side git hooks. A significant portion of commenters expressed strong frustration with hooks, citing performance bottlenecks that slow down commits and the "surprise error" flow where a simple commit is unexpectedly blocked by a failing linter. Many argued that these issues are better solved by enforcing checks in a CI/CD pipeline, which provides a public, non-optional feedback loop, or by using background watchers that validate code continuously rather than at the moment of commit. However, defenders of the hook model emphasized the value of immediate, local feedback to avoid a "fail-and-wait" cycle in CI, and highlighted the convenience of the `pre-commit` ecosystem which offers a vast library of pre-built checks. Technical discussions compared Prek to alternatives like `lefthook` and `hk`, with specific insights noting that `pre-commit` (and by extension Prek) uniquely runs checks only on staged changes, avoiding errors from uncommitted work. Alternative architectures were also proposed, including a background daemon approach (similar to `jj`) and using WASI sandboxing for security, though the latter faces challenges with code modification hooks.

## [Notepad++ supply chain attack breakdown](https://securelist.com/notepad-supply-chain-attack/118708/)
**Score:** 203 | **Comments:** 98 | **ID:** 46878338

> **Article:** The article details a supply chain attack on Notepad++, where the WinGUp update mechanism was compromised to distribute malware. Attackers replaced the legitimate updater binary with a malicious version that executed commands to gather system information and establish a command-and-control channel. The compromise went undetected for approximately six months, from July to December, despite the software being widely used by developers. The report highlights that the malicious update was delivered through a channel that did not properly validate digital signatures, bypassing a key security layer.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation quickly pivoted from the specific incident to broader security paradigms, with many users advocating for sandboxing applications as a primary defense. A significant theme was the tension between keeping software updated for security versus avoiding updates to prevent supply chain compromises, with some suggesting stable, long-term support distributions like Debian as a mitigation. Technical debate emerged around the effectiveness of Windows' security model, with some arguing it is more robust than Linux in certain aspects, while others countered that any system with malware should be considered compromised and require a full wipe. The lack of a centralized, secure package manager on Windows was identified as a root cause, leading to discussions about alternatives like the Microsoft Store, Chocolatey, and WinGet. Participants also dissected the attacker's methods, noting the poor operational security of scanning the command-and-control server on VirusTotal and the failure to check the updater's certificate. Finally, the discussion branched into finding Notepad++ alternatives on Linux and macOS, with suggestions like Kate and Sublime Text.

## [221 Cannon is Not For Sale](https://fredbenenson.com/blog/2026/02/03/221-cannon-is-not-for-sale/)
**Score:** 200 | **Comments:** 154 | **ID:** 46873574

> **Article:** The article details a sophisticated real estate scam where a fraudster impersonates the owner of a vacant property, like 221 Cannon, to sell it to an unsuspecting buyer. The author explains that in many US jurisdictions, a fraudulent deed can be recorded without prior verification of ownership, creating a legal mess for the true owner to unravel. The piece highlights the lack of a centralized national land registry in the United States, a system that makes such frauds easier to perpetrate than in countries with a Torrens-style title system. As a preventative measure, the author suggests placing a "Not For Sale" sign on the property, though he acknowledges this is not a foolproof solution.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly zeroed in on the systemic vulnerabilities that enable this type of fraud, debating why the US lacks a central land registry. While one user blamed lobbying from the title insurance industry, another countered that the federal government has no constitutional authority over land registration, which remains a state-level responsibility. The practical difficulty of proving ownership and clearing a fraudulent title was a major theme, with users debating whether a scammer could realistically profit, given that earnest money is held in escrow and the true owner would eventually contest the sale. Several participants shared personal anecdotes of similar fraud attempts, such as fake rental listings on Facebook, and offered practical, albeit imperfect, defenses like placing a lien on the property or using a "confused deputy" social engineering tactic to remove warning signs. The discussion also branched into broader critiques of law enforcement's limited capacity to investigate overseas scammers and the inadequacy of platforms like Facebook in removing fraudulent content.

## [Coding assistants are solving the wrong problem](https://www.bicameral-ai.com/blog/introducing-bicameral)
**Score:** 167 | **Comments:** 129 | **ID:** 46866481

> **Article:** The article argues that current coding assistants are solving the wrong problem by focusing on generating code rather than addressing the deeper challenges of software design and problem definition. It suggests that while AI can accelerate implementation, it fails to tackle the essential human tasks of understanding requirements and architectural trade-offs. The piece implies that this misalignment leads to technical debt and superficial solutions. Ultimately, it calls for a shift in focus from code generation to more fundamental engineering problems.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation reveals a deep divide over the practical value and risks of AI coding tools. Many developers, like micw, celebrate AI as an enabler that allows them to tackle unfamiliar domains or accelerate routine tasks like writing tests and documentation, but they emphasize that this success is contingent on their own foundational expertise. However, skeptics like netdevphoenix challenge the confidence of these anecdotes, demanding empirical evidence and questioning whether using AI fosters genuine skill development or merely creates a dependency that masks a lack of deep understanding. A related debate emerges on whether "engineering elegance" equates to business value, with some arguing that short-term delivery of "inelegant" code often wins in business contexts, while others counter that such tech debt inevitably incurs long-term costs. A key technical insight is that AI struggles with undefined problems and cross-process edge cases, where human intuition is critical for discovering requirements during development. The community reaction is polarized, with some viewing AI as a revolutionary tool and others warning against "true believer" hype, insisting on rigorous, data-driven evaluation over personal anecdotes.

## [AliSQL: Alibaba's open-source MySQL with vector and DuckDB engines](https://github.com/alibaba/AliSQL)
**Score:** 161 | **Comments:** 21 | **ID:** 46875228

> **Article:** Alibaba has released AliSQL, an open-source fork of MySQL that integrates vector and DuckDB database engines directly into the traditional relational system. This hybrid architecture aims to combine transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) within a single database instance. The project extends MySQL's internals to support these new engines, with documentation available on GitHub. This move positions AliSQL as a competitor to similar integrated database solutions that merge OLTP and OLAP capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** The community debated whether AliSQL represents a genuine step forward in HTAP architecture or merely a repackaging of existing concepts. Some users praised the productivity gains of having an embedded columnar store for analytics, noting that while MariaDB has a ColumnStore engine, it lacks indexes and unique constraints. However, critics argued that AliSQL's approach of "gluing together two completely different databases under a single interface" doesn't provide meaningful transactional consistency guarantees beyond what tools like Materialize or existing extensions (pg_ducklake, Timescale) already offer. A technical point emerged about whether transactional consistency is even desirable for analytical workloads, with one commenter questioning the need to pay that performance tax. The discussion also highlighted practical considerations, with users expressing interest in how this compares to pg_duckdb and lamenting the lack of a simple embedded ClickHouse-like database for PostgreSQL. Several participants noted the unusual commit history in the repository, speculating that the minimal history might be sanitized from internal development records, while others questioned the project's origins given Alibaba's known 996 work culture.

## [I made 20 GDPR deletion requests. 12 were ignored](https://nikolak.com/gdpr-failure/)
**Score:** 131 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 46874345

> **Article:** The linked article details the author's personal experiment with GDPR data deletion requests, in which they submitted 20 requests to various companies. The author found that 12 of these requests were completely ignored, highlighting a significant enforcement gap. The piece also notes that several companies who did respond provided only partial data or required additional verification steps. This real-world test serves as a critique of how effectively the regulation is being implemented by businesses.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation centered on the practical frustrations and perceived failures of GDPR implementation. Many commenters expressed a common theme: while they support the law's intent, its execution is flawed, citing the ubiquity of cookie popups as a prime example of unintended, annoying consequences. A technical insight emerged clarifying that GDPR itself does not mandate these popups, but rather the industry-wide interpretation of "informed consent" for cookies led to their proliferation. Significant disagreement arose over enforcement and penalties, with some arguing that fines are too harsh for small businesses and could stifle innovation, while others contended that ignoring data protection rules should not be excused, regardless of company size. The discussion also branched into comparisons with US regulations like CCPA, with debaters arguing over which approach better balances consumer rights with business viability. Ultimately, the thread reflected a broader skepticism about the effectiveness of unenforced laws and the EU's ability to foster a competitive tech ecosystem.
