The TSA’s new $45 fee to fly without a Real ID isn’t just a cash grab—it’s a legal fiction masquerading as policy. The agency claims it’s merely charging for "alternative identity verification," but the reality is more insidious: they’re monetizing a right. For decades, the TSA has allowed travelers to board without ID through a vetting process involving name, address, and watchlist checks—no fee required. Now, they’re slapping a price tag on that same process, effectively coercing people into upgrading to a Real ID. Legal experts argue the TSA lacks statutory authority to charge this fee, making it unlawful. Worse, it exposes the entire security theater for what it is: a performative ritual that collapses under scrutiny. If skipping the ID check were truly a risk, why allow it at all? And if it’s safe enough to permit, why charge for it? The optics are awful—especially when you consider this fee hits hardest on the unhoused, rural populations, and working poor who may not have easy access to DMVs. But the deeper issue is the erosion of principle: when a government agency starts charging for a previously free alternative to a mandated system, it’s not security—it’s coercion with a receipt.

This isn’t isolated. It’s part of a broader drift toward monetized compliance, where opting out of surveillance or standard systems comes at a premium. That same logic is now being challenged across the Atlantic, where France has decided it’s done subsidizing U.S. tech dominance. The country is phasing out Zoom and Microsoft Teams in favor of *La Suite*, a homegrown, open-source collaboration stack built with Django and React and released under the MIT license. The move is less about software quality—though let’s be honest, Teams is a bloated, buggy mess—and more about sovereignty. European governments are waking up to the fact that relying on American platforms means subjecting their communications to U.S. jurisdiction, political whims, and data grabs under FISA. The irony? Hosting *La Suite* on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned platform, undercuts the independence they’re trying to achieve. But the intent is clear: if you can’t control the stack, you don’t control the state. And with American politics increasingly driven by short-term voter rage over gas prices and culture wars, the rest of the world is hedging its bets. Digital de-Americanization isn’t coming—it’s already here.

Meanwhile, back in the land of broken abstractions, someone finally explained those mysterious equals signs littering leaked emails—like the Epstein files. They’re not cryptographic Easter eggs or redacted content. They’re the scars of quoted-printable encoding gone wrong. When long lines in emails are encoded, they end with `=CRLF`. But if the line endings get normalized to Unix-style `\n`, that trailing `=` gets orphaned and shows up in plain text. It’s a classic case of “just enough knowledge to be dangerous”—like parsing HTML with regex. The real horror isn’t the corruption; it’s that decades-old email standards, designed for 998-character lines and CRLF, are still causing visible artifacts in 2025. We’ve built AI agents, blockchains, and quantum simulators, but we can’t escape the baggage of SMTP. And yet, here we are, debugging line endings in leaked government correspondence like it’s 1998.

Which brings us to AI agents—because of course it does. The latest trend isn’t just coding assistants; it’s *agent skills*, a new framework for giving AI modular, documented tasks stored in markdown files. The idea is to offload detailed instructions from the context window, making agents more efficient. Some see it as premature standardization—another YAML config layer in a world already drowning in them—while others point to a 6-point gain on HumanEval when using skills with Codex. The real insight, though, came from a comment reframing agents as users: if your internal docs are so bad that even an AI can’t use them, maybe the problem isn’t the model—it’s your tools. This isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about treating agent usability like accessibility or SEO. If your API requires a PhD in tribal knowledge to use, you’ve already failed.

That said, the dream of local AI agents is still haunted by reality. Qwen3-Coder-Next, a 3B-parameter model from Alibaba, claims to rival Claude Sonnet 4.5 on coding tasks. It’s open-weight, GGUF-quantized, and runs on a high-end laptop. But early testers report it’s not there yet—basic errors, reasoning loops, the usual suspects. The bigger question isn’t performance; it’s definition. What does “local” even mean? Is it CapEx under $10k? No cloud? Or just avoiding vendor lock-in, even if you rent the GPU? The goal isn’t necessarily to replicate frontier models on a MacBook—it’s to avoid dependency on companies that ban your account for building personal tools. Anthropic’s recent outage, which took 15 minutes to appear on their status page, only reinforced that fragility. When your IDE stops working because a third-party API is down, you realize how thin the stack really is.

And speaking of stacks, Deno just launched a sandbox for running untrusted LLM-generated code—with a clever twist. Secrets like API keys never enter the sandbox. Instead, placeholders are injected at runtime only for approved domains. It’s like httpOnly cookies for AI: the code sees a dummy, but outbound requests get the real key. It’s a smart mitigation for secret leakage, though it won’t stop clever exfiltration via translation proxies or recursive sandbox creation. But with over 30 similar tools popping up, you have to wonder: is this innovation or just hype? The market is clearly sensing a need, but the space feels crowded, and vendor lock-in is a real risk. E2B’s open-source alternative stands out, but most of these solutions are betting on convenience over control.

On the infrastructure side, a federal court just ordered the restart of all U.S. offshore wind projects halted by the executive branch. The ruling is a win for climate policy, but the underlying issue is systemic: how do you build long-term infrastructure in a democracy where each administration can torch the last one’s plans? Offshore wind isn’t just battling NIMBYs and supply chains—it’s fighting political whiplash. Meanwhile, solar continues to crush it on cost and deployment speed, but wind’s capacity factor and night generation make it a necessary complement. The real villain? Personal grudges. Trump’s well-documented hatred of turbines near his properties has shaped national policy more than any cost-benefit analysis. When governance boils down to ego, progress becomes collateral damage.

Back in the world of retro minimalism, Floppinux—Linux on a 1.44MB floppy—is back for 2025. It’s a stunt, sure, but a telling one. The fact that a full OS can still boot from a floppy highlights how bloated modern systems have become. Office 97 still runs circles around modern web apps for basic productivity, and 32-bit x86 machines from the late ’90s could handle most tasks just fine—if only vendors hadn’t dropped support. The real barrier isn’t hardware; it’s software abandonment. But projects like Floppinux aren’t just nostalgia—they’re critique. They force us to ask: why does a text editor need 500MB of RAM?

Bunny Database, a new SQL-over-HTTP service from Bunny.net, tries to ride the serverless wave with global replication and a simple pricing model. But given their S3 compatibility has been “coming soon” since 2022, trust is thin. Managed databases save time, sure, but only if you believe the vendor will still be around—and competent—in six months. The trade-off between DIY and convenience is real, but so is the risk of lock-in. And while $0.30 per billion reads sounds cheap, it’s the reliability and support that’ll make or break it.

Firefox is adding a master switch to disable all AI features—a small win for user agency. But the fact that it’s opt-out, not opt-in, speaks volumes. Mozilla wants revenue, and AI is the new banner. Still, compared to Brave pushing crypto and AI in the same breath, Firefox feels almost principled. Almost.

Xcode 26.3 touts “agentic coding,” but many developers have already abandoned the IDE for CLI tools and AI agents. The debugger is slow, the UI clunky, and the file associations infuriating. Apple’s focus on AI feels like rearranging deck chairs while the ship sinks.

And then there’s the raid on X’s Paris offices—over CSAM, deepfakes, and Grok’s role in generating illegal content. The legal and moral lines are blurry: is AI-generated imagery of minors abuse, even if no real child was harmed? France says yes. Others aren’t so sure. But the bigger story is jurisdictional reach. Europe is flexing its regulatory muscle, and Musk’s platforms are in the crosshairs.

Worth watching: the quiet rise of open, sovereign tech stacks in Europe. They may not beat Silicon Valley on features, but they’re building something more valuable: trust.
