## [Two different tricks for fast LLM inference](https://www.seangoedecke.com/fast-llm-inference/)
**Score:** 156 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 47022329

> **Article:** The article examines two approaches to accelerate large language model inference, focusing on Cerebras’s wafer‑scale chip that packs 44 GB of SRAM and how OpenAI’s GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark is being positioned to fit within that memory. It contrasts the benefits of keeping the entire model in‑memory with the need to chain multiple chips for larger models, and notes that the 44 GB limit puts OpenAI in an awkward spot relative to its own model sizes. The piece also references Cerebras’s pricing page and suggests the Spark variant is a distilled, smaller version of the larger Codex model.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters argue that Cerebras’s 44 GB of SRAM gives it a theoretical advantage over Nvidia’s HBM‑based GPUs, but they disagree on whether that translates into real‑world speed gains. Several participants clarify the technical distinction between SRAM caches and DRAM, noting that the wafer‑scale chip’s large SRAM pool can hold entire models, while others point out that chaining multiple chips does not reduce token throughput but only adds latency. The discussion also touches on quantization strategies, with one user suggesting aggressive quantization could explain the smaller‑than‑expected Spark model, while another stresses that OpenAI’s 44 GB limit forces a distilled version rather than a full‑scale Codex. A separate thread brings up real‑time voice applications, highlighting that sub‑200 ms latency is crucial for natural conversation and that faster inference opens up possibilities like speculative decoding for voice agents. Finally, the community reflects on Anthropic’s ‘fast mode’ and the broader race among labs to balance speed, cost, and quality, underscoring that raw throughput alone is less valuable than maintaining low error rates.
