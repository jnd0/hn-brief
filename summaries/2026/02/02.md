## [Amiga Unix (Amix)](https://www.amigaunix.com/doku.php/home)
**Score:** 117 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46845244

> **Article:** Amiga Unix (Amix) was a short-lived Unix variant released by Commodore in 1990 for the Amiga 3000UX, based on AT&T's System V Release 4 (SVR4). Despite offering a full multiuser Unix environment on relatively affordable desktop hardware, it failed to gain traction due to limited hardware integration, lack of AmigaOS compatibility, and the rapid rise of x86-based Unix and Linux systems. The system featured the OpenLook graphical interface and included common Unix tools, but its closed-source nature and Commodore's bankruptcy effectively ended its development.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on Amix’s historical positioning as an “early Unix variant,” with debate over whether a 1990 release qualifies given Unix’s 20-year history by then—some argue that true modern Unix interfaces only crystallized with SVR4 and POSIX in 1988, making Amix relatively contemporary. Commenters highlight its technical limitations, noting it ignored the Amiga’s advanced multimedia hardware and couldn’t run AmigaOS software, rendering it a generic Unix box despite its potential as a low-cost workstation alternative. The closed-source nature of key components is lamented, though there's hope that lost source code might one day be released, especially since other retro systems like AmigaOS have seen partial open-sourcing. Nostalgic reflections on OpenLook’s UI and the broader 68k Unix ecosystem—spanning Atari, Sun, and Apple—paint a picture of a transitional era when home computers briefly flirted with professional Unix workloads before being overtaken by x86 and open-source momentum.
