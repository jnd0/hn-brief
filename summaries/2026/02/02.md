## [Apple's MacBook Pro DFU port documentation is wrong](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2026/2/1.html)
**Score:** 157 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46852096

> **Article:** The article claims that Apple's documentation for the DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) port on the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip is incorrect, as the author encountered repeated failures updating macOS when using the officially designated port, but succeeded after switching to a different Thunderbolt port. While Apple's documentation states that macOS cannot be updated from an external drive connected to the DFU port, the author argues this behavior contradicts real-world experience on their specific model, which lacks the special designation given to the 14-inch M4 model. The core issue revolves around undocumented port behavior affecting system updates, not necessarily the physical location of the DFU port itself.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly diverges between those defending Apple's DFU documentation as technically accurate and others sympathizing with the author’s practical frustrations. A key point of contention is whether the author misunderstands DFU—which is meant for firmware recovery, not general macOS updates—as several commenters clarify that DFU mode involves direct firmware communication via a specific boot ROM pathway, not standard OS installation. Technical insights emerge around why only one port supports DFU: it likely connects directly to the SoC’s built-in PHY without requiring additional firmware or power negotiation, unlike other ports routed through secondary controllers. While some users support the idea of port-specific quirks affecting external boot reliability, others argue the author’s issue stems from bootloader or firmware enumeration behavior, not incorrect DFU documentation, leading to a broader critique of Apple’s opaque system design and poor user-facing diagnostics.

## [Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation [pdf] (1985)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA157917.pdf)
**Score:** 118 | **Comments:** 59 | **ID:** 46851192

> **Article:** The 1985 paper "Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation in Distributed Systems" by Gul Agha presents a formal model for concurrent computation using actors—autonomous entities that communicate via asynchronous message passing. Each actor can process messages, create new actors, and determine how to respond to future messages, making the model particularly suited for distributed systems where concurrency, fault tolerance, and decentralization are critical. The work lays foundational concepts for later systems and languages that embrace message-passing concurrency.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation centers on the relevance and applicability of the actor model, especially whether it belongs primarily in distributed systems or can succeed in single-process environments. Kibwen argues that using actors outside distributed contexts is a “massive boondoggle,” favoring structured concurrency instead, while others like raphinou defend their use even in local systems—for instance, to serialize access to a Git repository safely. Skepticism emerges around debugging complexity and architectural overreach, with some sharing real-world experiences from Akka and Orleans deployments, while enthusiasts highlight the intellectual richness of the model, citing its influence on thinking about state, immutability, and event-driven design. Languages like Erlang, Elixir, and Pony are noted as successful embodiments, and regret surfaces over discontinued efforts like Microsoft’s Axum, underscoring a longing for cleaner, language-level support for concurrency models.
