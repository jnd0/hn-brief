## [Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation [pdf] (1985)](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA157917.pdf)
**Score:** 102 | **Comments:** 50 | **ID:** 46851192

> **Article:** The 1985 paper "Actors: A Model of Concurrent Computation in Distributed Systems" by Gul Agha presents a formal model for concurrent computation using actors—autonomous entities that communicate via asynchronous message passing. Each actor can process messages, create new actors, and determine its behavior for subsequent messages, making the model particularly suited for distributed and highly concurrent systems. The work lays foundational concepts for later systems and languages that embrace decentralization, fault tolerance, and scalability.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the relevance and applicability of the actor model, with strong opinions emerging over whether it belongs primarily in distributed systems or can succeed within single processes. Kibwen argues that using actors outside distributed contexts is a "massive boondoggle," advocating instead for structured concurrency, while others like raphinou share practical success stories using actors to serialize access to a git-backed API, though skeptics question whether simpler mechanisms like mutexes or queues would suffice. Enthusiasts praise the philosophical and architectural depth of actor-based frameworks like Orleans, Erlang, and Akka, with some lamenting discontinued efforts like Microsoft’s Axum, while detractors highlight debugging complexity and the invasive nature of the pattern in large codebases. The conversation reflects a broader tension between theoretical elegance and practical engineering trade-offs in concurrent system design.
