## [How to Scale a System from 0 to 10M+ Users](https://blog.algomaster.io/p/scaling-a-system-from-0-to-10-million-users)
**Score:** 132 | **Comments:** 74 | **ID:** 46845470

> **Article:** The article "How to Scale a System from 0 to 10M+ Users" outlines a staged approach to scaling web systems, starting with a monolithic architecture on a single server and progressively introducing load balancers, databases, caching, microservices, and autoscaling as user demand grows. It emphasizes incremental evolution of infrastructure in response to actual usage rather than premature optimization. However, it presents specific user thresholds for each stage—such as 100 users max per server—that are later heavily criticized in the discussion.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News community largely agreed with the article’s high-level philosophy of evolving architecture incrementally but sharply criticized its technical specifics, especially the claim that a single server can handle only around 100 users. Commenters pointed out that modern or even repurposed hardware can serve thousands or tens of thousands of users easily, suggesting the numbers were wildly off and possibly generated by an LLM. A major theme was skepticism about cloud-centric practices: autoscaling and microservices were seen as solutions to problems created by expensive cloud pricing and organizational bloat, not technical necessity, with several users advocating for bare-metal servers at lower cost and complexity. The discussion also highlighted that microservices primarily benefit large engineering teams, not early-stage products, and that many small teams suffer from "distributed spaghetti" when adopting them prematurely—while a modular monolith is often a smarter first step. Suspicion grew that the article was AI-generated, citing erratic bolding, generic structure, and inaccurate figures, though some acknowledged its outline was still pragmatically useful despite flawed execution.

**Score:** 103 | **Comments:** 38 | **ID:** 46849630

> **Article:** The article reports on a study showing that 12 months of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise can reduce brain age by nearly a year in early-to-midlife adults, as measured by brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD). MRI scans revealed that consistent physical activity was associated with a "younger" brain appearance, suggesting exercise may slow brain aging. While the exact biological pathways remain unclear, the findings support the idea that exercise contributes to long-term brain health.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the real-world significance of a nearly one-year reduction in brain age, with skepticism voiced over whether such a small effect justifies the effort of sustained exercise, while others argue that even modest gains compound over time and across physiological systems. Some users highlight the irony that despite overwhelming evidence of benefits, adherence remains low because exercise feels burdensome—though others counter that poor urban planning and lack of enjoyable environments, not the activity itself, are to blame. A key debate emerges around elite athletes, with one commenter suggesting excessive exercise may harm mental and physical health, only to be challenged with studies showing athletes outperform averages in cognition and longevity. Technical points about study design, cost, and confounding factors like mental engagement during exercise also arise, reinforcing both the difficulty of behavioral research and the broad consensus that some exercise is profoundly better than none.
