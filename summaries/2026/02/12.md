## [Discord/Twitch/Snapchat age verification bypass](https://age-verifier.kibty.town/)
**Score:** 912 | **Comments:** 431 | **ID:** 46982421

> **Article:** The article details a web‑based age‑verification bypass that uses a virtual webcam to feed synthetic video of an adult face to Discord, Twitch, and Snapchat, allowing users to access restricted content without a real selfie. It explains that the tool works by replaying a pre‑recorded video through a virtual camera, such as one created with OBS, and provides a step‑by‑step guide for setting up the fake webcam. The author notes that Discord’s k‑id provider only sends metadata, not raw facial images, yet the synthetic feed still satisfies the platform’s verification logic. The piece warns that such workarounds undermine intended child‑protection measures and expose users to legal risk while highlighting the broader vulnerability of selfie‑based age checks.
>
> **Discussion:** The thread opened with a claim that the most robust way to defeat Discord’s age verification is to feed synthetic video from a virtual webcam, and that the same technique works on Twitch and Snapchat, prompting a wave of technical speculation about how easily such spoofs can be built. Several commenters argued that platforms already have fallback ID‑check options and could simply switch to them, while others countered that the real driver is profit and user retention, pointing out that the verification system benefits companies, politicians, and advertisers alike. A parallel debate erupted over the social cost of abandoning Discord, with users describing the platform as a central hub for gaming communities, friendships, and shared media, and warning that moving would require coordinating dozens of contacts and losing years of history, which many consider impractical. Privacy‑focused voices highlighted that the age‑verification providers only transmit metadata, not raw facial images, and urged users to quit the service entirely, whereas others warned that the internet now harbors far more predatory activity than the 1990s IRC era and called for stronger separation between minors and adults. The discussion also touched on policy angles, with suggestions ranging from mandatory parental‑control enforcement to a hypothetical government‑run verification gateway, and a few participants questioned whether authorities would enforce the rules uniformly or selectively target platforms they dislike.

## [Improving 15 LLMs at Coding in One Afternoon. Only the Harness Changed](http://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/)
**Score:** 399 | **Comments:** 174 | **ID:** 46988596

> **Article:** The article argues that optimizing the "harness" – the interface and workflow surrounding LLMs – dramatically improves coding performance without retraining models. By redesigning edit formats and interaction patterns, the author claims to boost 15 different LLMs by 5-14 points on benchmarks while cutting output tokens by ~20%. Specific techniques include streamlining code editing commands to reduce errors. The author frames harness improvements as "free R&D" rivaling gains from new model training, noting Claude Code banned their API access during testing.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters largely agreed harness design is crucial, with logicprog emphasizing that the AI system encompasses both model and harness in a cybernetic feedback loop, enabling neurosymbolic approaches. However, skepticism emerged about the claimed scale: woah noted the 5% benchmark gain applied narrowly to find/replace tasks, questioning real-world impact versus "messianic" framing. Debates erupted over definitions – parhamn questioned whether harnesses were distinct from prompting, countered by znnajdla comparing them to essential IKEA tools. Developer futures sparked contention: cruffle_duffle argued LLMs will elevate programmers' abstraction level, while keybored countered that current tools merely automate without creating true abstractions. Corporate control concerns surfaced too, with horsawlarway warning harness "enshitification" could introduce paid tool placements, countered by Aurornis citing improving subscription value. The thread included meta-discussions on AI detection after fazgha noted logicprog's em-dash usage, prompting ahofmann to dismiss such "witch-hunting."

**Score:** 316 | **Comments:** 318 | **ID:** 46980591

> **Article:** Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan has launched a dark‑money political group called Garry’s List to influence California elections, targeting a proposed billionaire tax and opposing legislators such as Ro Khanna. The organization funds a blog that attacks public‑sector unions and promotes a ballot measure that would levy a tax on billionaires. This effort is framed as a response to what its backers view as excessive influence of progressive policies and public‑sector interests. The move has sparked intense debate over the role of wealthy tech leaders in state politics.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters argue that Tan’s political spending exemplifies the very wealth‑driven influence they claim to oppose, with many pointing to his targeting of Ro Khanna and the broader push for a billionaire tax as a test of California’s progressive agenda. Several participants question whether large donations actually sway high‑information elections, citing studies that suggest money matters more in low‑information contexts. A recurring theme is the tension between direct‑democracy proposals — such as online voting with delegated decisions — and the practical challenges of implementing them at scale. Others highlight the irony of wealthy founders using their fortunes to shape policy while simultaneously warning that such taxes will drive them out of the state. The discussion also touches on the broader critique of tech elites’ involvement in politics, with some dismissing it as self‑serving and others urging more substantive debate on taxation and public policy.

## [US businesses and consumers pay 90% of tariff costs, New York Fed says](https://www.ft.com/content/c4f886a1-1633-418c-b6b5-16f700f8bb0d)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 253 | **ID:** 46990056

> **Article:** The article reports that US businesses and consumers bear 90% of the costs of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, according to the New York Fed. This finding challenges the common narrative that tariffs primarily target foreign exporters, instead highlighting how these taxes increase domestic prices for goods and inputs. The analysis underscores the economic burden on American households and companies, contradicting claims that tariffs effectively shift production back to the US.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centers on the economic impact and effectiveness of the US tariffs. Key themes include the fundamental misunderstanding that tariffs are paid by foreign exporters, with multiple commenters emphasizing they are ultimately borne by domestic consumers and businesses (e.g., SunshineTheCat, taeric). Technical insights emerge regarding the operational challenges, such as Incoterms like DAP where shippers face liability for unpaid duties (varispeed, Aloisius). Disagreements focus on the tariffs' goals: ApolloFortyNine argues they can work for specific industries like autos if stable, while K0nserv and toast0 criticize their broadness, legal fragility, and negative effects on domestic production costs. Some participants (phkahler, hackyhacky) question whether the tariffs achieve their stated aim of reshoring manufacturing, citing instability and higher input costs. The discussion also touches on the political motivations behind the tariffs, framing them as a tool for the Trump base to support domestic industries despite economic drawbacks, and contrasting Republican support for tariffs with their traditional anti-tax stance.

## [GPT-5 outperforms federal judges in legal reasoning experiment](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6155012)
**Score:** 297 | **Comments:** 219 | **ID:** 46982792

> **Article:** Researchers evaluated GPT‑5 on a benchmark of federal legal reasoning cases and found it reaches the legally correct outcome more often than human judges, with the model making no errors in the study’s definition of error. The analysis, posted on SSRN (abstract_id=6155012), defines an error as a departure from the law, noting that standards often involve discretionary judgment. The authors argue that consistency in applying such standards can be measured algorithmically, suggesting LLMs may outperform traditional adjudication in certain contexts.
>
> **Discussion:** Participants questioned whether an algorithm can truly capture the discretionary judgment that underpins common‑law decision‑making, citing cases where statutory language produces absurd outcomes for teenagers who create self‑portrait child‑porn. Several commenters argued that AI could help expose and fix such legislative bugs, but warned that delegating moral and contextual nuance to a machine risks embedding existing biases. Others pointed out that the notion of a single “legally correct” outcome is flawed in a system built on precedent and judicial discretion, making any claim of error‑free AI dubious. The debate also touched on governance, with concerns about who would control an autonomous judicial AI and how its independence could be guaranteed. Overall the conversation oscillated between optimism about AI’s potential to improve consistency and skepticism about its ability to replace the human elements of justice.

## [Apple patches decade-old iOS zero-day, possibly exploited by commercial spyware](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/12/apple_ios_263/)
**Score:** 222 | **Comments:** 150 | **ID:** 46989107

> **Article:** Apple has patched a decade‑old vulnerability in iOS 26.3 that was reportedly leveraged in a commercial spyware chain, according to The Register. The flaw, present in the kernel for more than ten years, allowed attackers to gain memory‑write capabilities and was linked to the Pegasus exploit suite used by NSO Group. Apple’s release notes mention the fix alongside the rollout of its new Apple‑designed radio baseband, which replaces Broadcom and Qualcomm components. The patch is part of a broader effort to harden the platform, though users on older devices will not receive the update and must stay on iOS 18, which remains vulnerable.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters questioned whether Apple’s Lockdown Mode and the new Mobile Integrity Engine (MIE) eMTE actually raise the bar against state‑sponsored actors, with some pointing to a practical MDM‑bypass technique that disables enrollment checks by blocking DNS during a macOS installer. Others argued that spy agencies do not need to plant bugs, as memory‑unsafe code in a massive C/C++ codebase inevitably yields exploitable flaws, while a few insisted that deliberate backdoors are the only way to explain such long‑standing zero‑days. The thread also highlighted the trade‑off between security and usability, noting that iOS 18 devices left unpatched on newer hardware suffer performance degradation and battery drain, prompting calls for Apple to back‑port critical fixes. A recurring theme was the difficulty of detection: even with memory‑safety improvements, users cannot know if they have been compromised, and forensic tools are limited to capturing app‑intent data. Finally, several users recommended alternative platforms, such as GrapheneOS or Qubes OS, as more privacy‑focused options, while others defended Apple’s ecosystem for its seamless cross‑device integration despite its security shortcomings.

## [Carl Sagan's Baloney Detection Kit: Tools for Thinking Critically (2025)](https://www.openculture.com/2025/09/the-carl-sagan-baloney-detection-kit.html)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 83 | **ID:** 46985609

> **Article:** The article outlines Carl Sagan’s “Baloney Detection Kit,” a set of heuristics for evaluating extraordinary claims. It uses the “dragon in the garage” thought experiment to illustrate how an invisible, undetectable entity cannot be distinguished from nonexistence. It also references Sagan’s 1995 prediction of America’s cultural and technological decline, quoting his warning about superstition and loss of critical faculties. The piece is published on Open Culture in 2025 and links to related essays.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters invoke Sagan’s invisible‑dragon metaphor to question whether any claim that cannot be falsified should be treated as meaningful or merely a linguistic trick. Several participants draw a parallel to software, arguing that hidden layers of code can be inferred only indirectly, echoing the same epistemic limits. Others challenge the historical accuracy of Sagan’s forecast of America’s decline, suggesting that his attribution to superstition oversimplifies deeper economic and political forces. A few voices defend the value of the kit itself, emphasizing the importance of skepticism paired with wonder and the need to examine opposing arguments more thoroughly than their proponents. The thread also touches on broader rhetorical practices, noting that ancient rhetoric required understanding both sides of an issue, a standard that modern discourse often lacks.

## [US labels SpaceX a common carrier by air, will regulate firm under railway law](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/victory-for-elon-musk-us-labor-board-abandons-authority-over-spacex/)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 56 | **ID:** 46980474

> **Article:** The U.S. Department of Transportation has reclassified SpaceX as a "common carrier by air," subjecting it to regulation under the Railway Labor Act (RLA) instead of standard labor laws. This move, framed as recognizing the critical nature of space infrastructure, changes the framework for labor disputes, making strikes and unionization efforts more difficult. The reclassification follows a 2024 NLRB complaint alleging 37 labor law violations by SpaceX, including the firing of employees who circulated an open letter criticizing CEO Elon Musk's behavior and the company's culture. Supporters argue it aligns with the essential role of rocketry, while critics see it as a politically motivated maneuver to shield the company from worker protections.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on whether reclassifying SpaceX under the Railway Labor Act is a legitimate recognition of its critical infrastructure role or a corporate-friendly tactic to undermine labor rights. Many commenters dispute the "essential goods" justification, arguing that a month-long SpaceX strike would not cause societal collapse unlike disruptions in airlines or railroads, and suspect the move is retaliation for the employees' open letter about Musk. The conversation delves into the specifics of the NLRB's 37-count complaint, which details coercive interrogations and firings related to protected concerted activity, contrasting SpaceX's claim that the employees were merely disruptive. A key technical insight notes that the RLA severely restricts strikes, potentially neutering union power, which commenters like Animats warn could backfire by forcing SpaceX into a union shop. The political dimension is heavily debated, with accusations of corporate bribery and favoritism within the Trump administration, and predictions that such overt alignment could lead to nationalization if political power shifts. Finally, the thread speculates on the future of unionization at SpaceX, with some suggesting automation (Optimus drones) may preempt traditional organizing, while others note the inherent difficulty of forming a union under RLA constraints.

## [TikTok is tracking you, even if you don't use the app](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260210-tiktok-is-tracking-you-even-if-you-dont-use-the-app-heres-how-to-stop-it)
**Score:** 130 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46989151

> **Article:** TikTok is using an updated advertising pixel that can track users across external websites even when they never open the TikTok app, a change that took effect after its US operations transferred ownership on 22 January 2026. The pixel now helps advertisers follow a user’s purchase behavior beyond the platform, feeding data into TikTok’s new cross‑site ad network. The BBC article explains how this works and offers ways to block the invisible trackers, such as using privacy‑focused browsers and DNS‑level filters. It also notes that advertising pixels are a common industry practice, but TikTok’s implementation targets non‑users as well.
>
> **Discussion:** Hacker News participants quickly pointed out that tracking pixels are nothing new and are used by many platforms, but they argued that TikTok’s cross‑site implementation is more invasive because it collects data from people who have never used the app. Several commenters accused the article of downplaying the difference between industry‑standard pixels and TikTok’s newly aggressive data‑sharing model, while others highlighted the timing of the change after the company’s US handover. Technical users debated the practicality of blocking these trackers, discussing DNS‑level filtering, Pi‑hole configurations, and the limitations of simply disabling image loading in email clients. A few voices brought up geopolitical angles, questioning whether Chinese ownership makes the surveillance more concerning than that of Western tech giants. The conversation also touched on broader frustrations about consent, the opacity of SDK integrations, and the difficulty of achieving true privacy in an ad‑driven web.
