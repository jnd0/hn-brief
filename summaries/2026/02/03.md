## [xAI joins SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/updates#xai-joins-spacex)
**Score:** 533 | **Comments:** 1187 | **ID:** 46862170

> **Article:** SpaceX announced that xAI, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, is joining forces with SpaceX to develop space-based AI compute infrastructure. The update outlines a plan to launch a massive constellation of satellites equipped with AI accelerators, harnessing solar power to provide scalable compute capacity. According to the announcement, launching a million tons of satellites per year, each delivering 100 kW of compute, would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute annually, with a long-term goal of reaching terawatt-scale. The companies claim this approach avoids terrestrial constraints like cooling and power availability, positioning space as the future of AI training and inference.
>
> **Discussion:** The HN community largely greeted the announcement with skepticism, questioning both the technical feasibility and the underlying motives. Critics pointed out the enormous challenges of cooling, maintenance, radiation hardening, and the astronomical launch costs, noting that current manufacturing and launch capabilities fall far short of the million-ton annual target. Many argued that the plan is either a financial engineering tactic to prop up SpaceX or xAI, or a distraction from more practical space applications, citing the absurdity of scaling to terawatt levels given global PV production. The discussion also highlighted the irony of Musk's past warnings about runaway AI while proposing a distributed orbital AI platform that could be harder to control. Some commenters compared it to Microsoft's underwater data center experiment, but others noted that space presents far harsher conditions and that the proposal glosses over the massive redundancy needed to compensate for inevitable failures. Overall, the thread reflected deep doubt that space-based AI compute could be realized in the near term, with many seeing it as hype or a con rather than a viable technical roadmap.

## [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)
**Score:** 330 | **Comments:** 171 | **ID:** 46854642

> **Article:** Termux is a terminal emulator and Linux environment app for Android that operates without root access. It provides a full package repository and allows users to compile software from source using tools like clang and make. Users commonly pair it with Bluetooth keyboards or styli like the Samsung S-Pen to perform tasks such as SSH, Vim editing, Python scripting, and running TUI applications like yazi, making it a cornerstone for mobile productivity.
>
> **Discussion:** Users debate the practicality of terminal work on touchscreens, with many resorting to Bluetooth keyboards or precise styli like the S-Pen, while others await devices with integrated keyboards.

## [Todd C. Miller – Sudo maintainer for over 30 years](https://www.millert.dev/)
**Score:** 326 | **Comments:** 185 | **ID:** 46858577

> **Article:** Todd C. Miller is the long-time maintainer of sudo, a critical privilege escalation tool used on nearly all Linux and Unix systems, and he has been overseeing the project for over three decades. The article on his personal website highlights his enduring commitment and notes that he is currently seeking a sponsor to fund ongoing development. Miller's work underpins security and administrative functions across global infrastructure, yet he relies on community support rather than corporate backing. The piece underscores the importance of sustaining essential open-source projects through dedicated sponsorship.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly centered on the sustainability of critical open-source infrastructure, with many commenters expressing concern that a maintainer of sudo's importance must beg for sponsorship while corporations profit from its use. Debates emerged over sudo's design: some argued it has suffered from creeping featuritis and that simpler alternatives like OpenBSD's doas suffice, while others defended its extensive feature set for complex enterprise environments, including LDAP integration and fine-grained access control. The thread also tackled broader systemic issues, with opinions ranging from criticism of the GPL's enforcement to the claim that open source itself is exploitative, and suggestions ranging from Patreon-style micropayments (dismissed due to transaction fees) to a centralized foundation like the Linux Foundation administering funds. A lighter side conversation about sudo's xkcd-inspired mascot sparked a debate over gender representation, with some calling it misogynistic and others noting the character's ambiguous portrayal. Overall, the community reflected on the paradox of a tool that is both ubiquitous and underfunded, and the need for new models to support maintainers as they age out.

## [Anki ownership transferred to AnkiHub](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankis-growing-up/68610)
**Score:** 271 | **Comments:** 71 | **ID:** 46861313

> **Article:** The Anki forum post announces that Damien (dae), the original creator, is transferring ownership of the Anki project to AnkiHub, a company founded by the AnKing team that currently employs 35 people and sells deck subscriptions. The post states that Anki will remain open source at its core, Damien will remain involved at a more sustainable level, and there are no investors involved, with a stated goal of avoiding "enshittification." A specific detail is that AnkiHub's deck content is hosted on a private platform requiring account agreement to view listings.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion clarifies the fragmented Anki ecosystem, distinguishing between the open-source desktop app (Anki), the official sync/deck service (AnkiWeb), the independent open-source Android client (AnkiDroid), and the new for-profit owner (AnkiHub). Key themes include widespread concern about potential "enshittification"—degrading the free product to push paid services—balanced by reassurance from the AGPL license's anti-DRM clause and the lack of venture capital investors. Technical insights note that the core FSRS scheduling algorithm is separately MIT-licensed, and the Rust-based core library supports multiple clients. Disagreements center on trust: some users are relieved by the no-VC structure and see it as preferable to abandonment, while others are skeptical due to AnkiHub's prior introduction of unrequested AI features in their add-ons. Community reactions highlight praise for AnkiDroid's openness contrasted with the paid iOS app's shortcomings, and some users mention exploring alternatives like Mochi.cards while questioning the new entity's governance and roadmap.

## [Leaked chats expose the daily life of a scam compound's enslaved workforce](https://www.wired.com/story/the-red-bull-leaks/)
**Score:** 266 | **Comments:** 152 | **ID:** 46852660

> **Article:** The article details leaked chat logs exposing the horrific conditions and operations of a scam compound in Laos called Muzahir. The chats reveal enslaved workers being forced to run "pig butchering" cryptocurrency scams, with employees threatened with violence for poor performance and punished by having their earnings withheld. The compound, run by Chinese organized crime, trafficked workers from across Asia and operated with apparent impunity due to corrupt local law enforcement in Laos's Golden Triangle region.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters revealed a complex debate about the ethics of scamming operations and their victims. Some commenters drew parallels between this modern slavery and historical chattel slavery, with one user arguing that slaves are actually the least productive workers, which explains why slavers don't push conditions to absolute extremes. Another thread examined the moral ambiguity of "scammer gets owned" YouTube videos, with some defending them as the least harmful response to scammers who destroy lives, while others argued the front-line workers are themselves victims without agency. The conversation also touched on broader themes of global inequality, with users noting that forced labor and human trafficking persist even within Western countries, and that the "Western bubble" often obscures the harsh realities faced by most of the world's population. Several commenters expressed surprise that such operations exist at all, highlighting a disconnect between perception and reality regarding modern slavery.

## [The TSA's New $45 Fee to Fly Without ID Is Illegal](https://www.frommers.com/tips/airfare/the-tsa-new-45-fee-to-fly-without-id-is-illegal-says-regulatory-expert/)
**Score:** 259 | **Comments:** 265 | **ID:** 46863162

> **Article:** Frommers reports that the TSA has started charging a $45 fee to passengers who attempt to fly domestically without a Real ID-compliant identification. A regulatory expert cited in the article argues the fee is illegal because it penalizes travelers for exercising their right to travel without ID, which federal law does not require. The fee appears designed to coerce individuals into obtaining costly Real IDs, and it may violate the Administrative Procedure Act. While passengers can still fly without ID by undergoing extra verification, the fee creates a financial barrier.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion around the TSA's $45 fee for passengers lacking Real ID revealed sharp divisions over its legality and intent. Many commenters argued the fee is an illegal money grab, noting that no federal law requires ID for domestic flights and that charging for the "privilege" of traveling violates the right to movement. Others countered that the fee covers the cost of extra staff needed for manual identity verification and acts as a deterrent, not a profit scheme. Participants shared personal anecdotes of flying without ID by invoking medical exemptions or refusing scanners, highlighting inconsistencies in TSA enforcement. The debate also touched on equity concerns, with some pointing out that Real ID acquisition costs disproportionately affect low-income and immigrant travelers, while others questioned the necessity of universal ID given existing surveillance. Side discussions included qualified immunity's role in blocking lawsuits against TSA and the ease of opting out of facial recognition, though these were less central.
