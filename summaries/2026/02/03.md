## [Todd C. Miller – Sudo maintainer for over 30 years](https://www.millert.dev/)
**Score:** 267 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46858577

> **Article:** The article highlights Todd C. Miller as the maintainer of the critical `sudo` utility for over 30 years, noting that he is currently seeking a sponsor to fund continued development. It underscores the paradox that `sudo`, a security pillar for trillions of dollars of global infrastructure, is maintained by an individual who receives little financial compensation. The post implicitly criticizes the unsustainable model where essential open-source infrastructure relies on the unpaid labor of maintainers who often cannot afford to work full-time on such projects.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters focused on the unsustainable economics of maintaining critical open-source infrastructure. A major theme is the exploitation of maintainers, with commenters arguing that corporations rely on free labor for essential tools like `sudo` while new maintainers cannot afford to step up due to financial pressures, potentially leading to a future of closed systems. This sparked debate over the nature of open source itself, with one view suggesting the model is inherently exploitative, while others countered that charging creates barriers to adoption and that the "free" nature is why FOSS spread. Technical disagreements emerged about `sudo`'s complexity and relevance; some called it bloated "creeping featuritis" and praised OpenBSD's simpler `doas` replacement, while others defended its extensive feature set for enterprise needs like LDAP integration and its use as a fine-grained access control tool in production. Proposed solutions like Patreon or GitHub Sponsors were dismissed as impractical due to the sheer number of projects users depend on and high transaction fees, leading to calls for a collective licensing body to extract fees from corporations. The thread also included lighter community reactions, noting the terrifying mascot and referencing relevant xkcd comics about dependency maintenance.

## [Nano-vLLM: How a vLLM-style inference engine works](https://neutree.ai/blog/nano-vllm-part-1)
**Score:** 207 | **Comments:** 24 | **ID:** 46855447

> **Article:** The article "Nano-vLLM: How a vLLM-style inference engine works" presents a compact, readable implementation of vLLM's inference engine, emphasizing its block-based KV caching and CPU/GPU memory mapping that enable efficient continuous batching. It walks through the core logic of managing virtual memory blocks for attention, a concept analogous to PagedAttention though not named as such. The author, a cloud infrastructure developer without an ML background, shares insights from their study of nano-vLLM and includes hand-drawn diagrams to clarify the architecture. A second part is promised, which will compare dense and Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, even though nano-vLLM is currently hardcoded for a dense Qwen3 model.
>
> **Discussion:** A key critique was that the article omitted explicit mention of PagedAttention, a foundational technique in vLLM, and that its polished style suggested AI generation. The author rebutted, explaining the piece was manually written from the viewpoint of a non-ML practitioner and that they had independently described the block management system without recognizing it as PagedAttention. This led to a meta-debate about the stigma around AI-assisted writing and how overly sanitized prose can itself raise suspicion. Some commenters appreciated the educational approach and called for similar "nano" explanations of other complex systems like Kubernetes and PostgreSQL. The thread also included a plug for a structured LLM outputs handbook and the author's link to the sequel article.

## [Waymo seeking about $16B near $110B valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-31/waymo-seeking-about-16-billion-near-110-billion-valuation)
**Score:** 186 | **Comments:** 266 | **ID:** 46856854

> **Article:** Waymo, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Alphabet, is seeking approximately $16 billion in funding at a near $110 billion valuation. This capital raise is intended to finance the massive capital expenditures required to scale its fleet of self-driving cars for a global rollout. The move underscores the significant investment needed to transition from a limited regional service to a large-scale, profitable autonomous ride-hailing business.
>
> **Discussion:** Users enthusiastically praised Waymo for providing a vastly less stressful and safer experience compared to human-driven taxis or ride-shares, with some declaring they would never want to interact with a human driver again. This enthusiasm was tempered by poignant reflections on the potential loss of meaningful human connection and the difficult, undignified conditions faced by professional drivers, raising urgent questions about mass job displacement. The necessity of external funding was debated, with finance-savvy commenters explaining that the capital-intensive nature of owning and maintaining a massive vehicle fleet makes a separate capital structure for Waymo logical, unlike Tesla's model which is built on existing manufacturing scale. A key thread compared Waymo's strategy to Tesla's, noting that while Tesla's valuation bets on future Full Self-Driving software atop massive production capacity, Waymo must first prove it can scale cost-effectively. Finally, several commenters challenged the notion that Waymo couldn't become "enshittified," drawing parallels to Uber's path of undercutting prices followed by hikes, and speculating on future monetization through in-car ads, data sales, or route manipulation, while others argued regulatory capture by powerful financial interests would shield it from political backlash.

## [Microsoft is walking back Windows 11's AI overload](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-is-reevaluating-its-ai-efforts-on-windows-11-plans-to-reduce-copilot-integrations-and-evolve-recall)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 264 | **ID:** 46854951

> **Article:** Microsoft is reportedly reevaluating its AI strategy for Windows 11, planning to streamline or remove certain Copilot integrations and evolve the controversial "Recall" feature. This follows significant user and critical pushback against what was perceived as an overload of unnecessary AI features. The move signifies a potential retreat from aggressively baking AI into every facet of the OS, with specific features like Copilot in Notepad and Paint cited as examples of misjudged additions.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion is overwhelmingly critical of Microsoft's recent Windows 11 direction, framing the rollback as a failure of initial governance and product sense. Commenters argue the AI features were added due to internal careerism and hype-driven KPIs, not user need, pointing to absurd integrations like Copilot in Notepad. A key theme is nostalgia for the Ballmer era, with many asserting current leadership has disconnected from the core product, alienating users with ads, forced services, and bloat. This has driven several users to switch to Linux, while others debate the technical feasibility of reverting changes, with one detailed comment listing pervasive stability and configuration issues in enterprise deployments. Disagreements include whether the Office brand is truly damaged and whether the kernel or userland is the problem, with a strong consensus that the OS has become an "advertising and user surveillance machine."

> **Article:** An ICE protester claims her Global Entry membership was revoked after an agent used facial recognition to identify her during a protest. The article details her account of being confronted by agents who scanned her face and later lost her trusted traveler status, which she attributes to political retaliation. This incident raises concerns about the use of biometric surveillance by immigration authorities against lawful protesters. The protester's experience is presented as part of a broader pattern of government monitoring of dissent.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters focused on whether this incident reflects systemic authoritarianism or an isolated claim, with deep political divisions. Some users, like SilverElfin, condemn it as proof of an unaccountable executive branch, while others, like nickff, argue the U.S. remains a robust democracy despite flaws, sparking debate over international democracy rankings. A key technical and strategic disagreement emerges over the use of facial recognition versus license plates for identification, with notepad0x90 asserting agents explicitly threaten protestors with being entered into a domestic terrorist database via facial recognition. Blame is sharply split: clipsy argues the GOP and electorate are responsible for enabling such actions, whereas others suggest the problem is structural. Sarcastic remarks about "fascism" and warnings about the potential collapse of the DHS or the country itself illustrate profound distrust and fatalism among some commenters. The thread also notes this story duplicates earlier discussions on the site.

**Score:** 151 | **Comments:** 106 | **ID:** 46853888

> **Article:** The European Union has launched the GOVSATCOM initiative, a program designed to provide secure satellite communication services to EU governments and agencies, as part of a broader push for technological sovereignty. This involves creating a centralized marketplace to access existing satellite capacity rather than launching new satellites immediately. The effort is linked to the larger IRIS² project, a planned secure connectivity constellation. A key strategy involves partnerships with non-EU nations like India, Japan, and the UAE for capital and technology, exemplified by Eutelsat's three-way ownership structure involving India's Bharti Group.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters focused on the EU's capacity to fund sovereignty initiatives against demographic and fiscal pressures, with sajithdilshan questioning affordability given aging populations and welfare costs. Pjc50 and celeritascelery debated the comparative scale of the EU welfare state versus the US, with pjc50 framing local spending as beneficial "import substitution." Alephnerd countered the affordability concern by highlighting the EU's multilateral partnership model with Asian nations, though baklavaEmpero raised trust concerns regarding Israel as a partner. A significant thread debated military spending levels, sparked by buckle8017's claim that the EU would need 10% GDP to replace US military support; bluebarbet cited NATO's 5% target, while kyboren argued historical US spending inertia meant a decade of very high investment would be required for true autonomy. Wongarsu clarified that GOVSATCOM is primarily a service marketplace, not a new satellite system, and derelicta dismissed the effort as "too little too late," reflecting broader skepticism about the EU's strategic timeliness.

## [EPA Advances Farmers' Right to Repair](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-advances-farmers-right-repair-their-own-equipment-saving-repair-costs-and)
**Score:** 148 | **Comments:** 61 | **ID:** 46859118

> **Article:** The EPA has issued new guidance that supports farmers' right to repair their own agricultural equipment by clarifying that temporary bypass of emissions controls for repair purposes does not violate the Clean Air Act, as long as systems are restored to compliance. This guidance aims to reduce repair costs and challenge manufacturers' use of digital restrictions to limit third-party repairs, though it does not mandate that manufacturers share tools or documentation. A specific detail includes the reference to federal penalties under 40 CFR § 89.1006, where dealers face fines of $32,500 per violation for rendering emissions controls inoperative. Critics argue the guidance lacks enforcement teeth and may be exploited by manufacturers to find alternative barriers.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters debated whether the EPA's guidance represents a substantive step for right to repair or a superficial gesture that manufacturers will circumvent with new excuses, with many citing historical patterns of industry resistance. Liability concerns dominated discussions, as examples from farm-equipment.com highlighted lawsuits and hefty fines against dealers for customer modifications, even when uninvolved, underscoring the legal risks that deter repair support. The political framing as anti-Clean Air Act regulatory relief sparked division: some saw it as a savvy tactic to appeal to conservative bases for pro-consumer gains, while others warned it could erode environmental standards and enable "rolling coal" under the guise of repair. Personal anecdotes, such as detuning tractors to avoid emissions systems for improved reliability but increased pollution, illustrated the technical and ethical tensions between repair accessibility and ecological impact, leaving the community skeptical about the EPA's commitment under the current administration.

## [LICENSE: _may be_ licensed to use source code; incorrect license grant](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/issues/8886)
**Score:** 146 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46861331

> **Article:** The GitHub issue titled "LICENSE: _may be_ licensed to use source code; incorrect license grant" highlights ambiguous wording in Mattermost's LICENSE.txt, specifically the phrase "You may be licensed to use source code to create compiled versions not produced by Mattermost, Inc." Critics argue that "may be" suggests uncertainty rather than a clear permission grant, especially when contrasted with the later clause "You are licensed to use compiled versions..." The issue notes that Mattermost has not clarified this language for years, raising concerns that the ambiguity is intentional to steer users toward commercial licensing. This specific phrasing has ignited debate about proper license drafting and the legal risks of using the software.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters focused on whether the word "may" in the license constitutes a valid permission grant or creates dangerous ambiguity. Some commenters assert that "may" is standard English for granting permission (e.g., "you may kiss the bride"), while others counter that in legal contexts it implies possibility and could be interpreted against the drafter under the contra proferentem doctrine. Several participants share anecdotes about copyright trolls using vague attribution terms to extort settlements, drawing parallels to Mattermost's alleged strategy of maintaining uncertainty to promote commercial licenses. There is disagreement over the overall clarity of the license: some view it as a multiply-licensed (AGPL, MIT, commercial) document with poor phrasing but no trap, while others see the ambiguity as unethical and a deliberate business tactic. The community also debates default copyright status (Berne Convention) and stresses the importance of using standard, unambiguous licenses to avoid such disputes, criticizing Mattermost's prolonged refusal to revise the text.

## [Geologists may have solved mystery of Green River's 'uphill' route](https://phys.org/news/2026-01-geologists-mystery-green-river-uphill.html)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 36 | **ID:** 46855803

> **Article:** Geologists have solved the mystery of the Green River's seemingly uphill route by identifying a sinking lithospheric drip—a cold, dense anomaly 200 km below the surface—that tilted the landscape. This drip broke off between 2 and 5 million years ago, creating a bullseye-shaped topographic pattern that redirected the river's flow. The findings, presented in a rigorously peer-reviewed paper with over 100 citations, explain how the river carved a deep canyon against apparent gravitational gradients.
>
> **Discussion:** The thread began with criticism of the article's misleading header image, which showed the Maroon Bells rather than the Green River canyon, sparking complaints about lazy stock footage use in media, with parallels drawn to inaccuracies in shows like HGTV's House Hunters. This segued into a technical discussion of the lithospheric drip theory, where users calculated its descent speed at roughly 0.1 meters per year and debated whether glaciation could have contributed to the observed bullseye pattern, with references to the paper's credibility dismissing alternative ideas. Several commenters recommended John McPhee's Annals of the Former World and other geology books for deeper exploration, while a link to the open-access research paper was shared for verification. The conversation also included a humorous aside noting that co-author Dr. Adam Smith works at the University of Glasgow, playing on the famous economist's name. Overall, the discussion balanced scientific engagement with media skepticism and literary suggestions.
