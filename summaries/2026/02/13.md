## [US businesses and consumers pay 90% of tariff costs, New York Fed says](https://www.ft.com/content/c4f886a1-1633-418c-b6b5-16f700f8bb0d)
**Score:** 329 | **Comments:** 287 | **ID:** 46990056

> **Article:** A New York Fed study finds that U.S. businesses and consumers bear 90% of the cost of tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, contradicting the common political narrative that tariffs are paid by foreign nations. The article, published by the Financial Times, highlights how these tariffs—implemented under executive authority—have increased prices for American households and businesses without significantly reshoring manufacturing, despite claims that they would incentivize domestic production. The tariffs, targeting a broad range of goods from electronics to machinery, have disrupted supply chains and raised input costs for U.S. manufacturers, even as some packaging and logistics firms report explosive growth due to increased demand.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters widely agree that tariffs are ultimately paid by American consumers, not foreign governments, drawing parallels to sugar taxes where the burden falls on buyers despite being levied on producers. There is sharp disagreement over the policy’s intent: some defend tariffs as tools to reshape domestic economic behavior and reduce reliance on China, while others argue the broad, inconsistent application—often reversed with political tweets—undermines long-term investment and creates uncertainty for manufacturers. Technical insights emerge around supply chain dynamics, such as how tariffs on raw materials and machinery make domestic production harder to scale, and how carriers like FedEx and DHL shift tariff payment responsibility to recipients, making the cost invisible until delivery. A recurring theme is the class impact: tariffs act as regressive taxes that disproportionately hurt low- and middle-income households, contrasting with progressive tax preferences among critics. Some highlight historical precedent, noting that targeted tariffs on autos once successfully encouraged onshoring, but warn that today’s sweeping, legally dubious measures lack the stability and precision needed for meaningful industrial policy. The community largely views the current approach as economically illiterate, politically opportunistic, and counterproductive to the very goals its proponents claim to pursue.
