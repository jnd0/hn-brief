## [Sizing chaos](https://pudding.cool/2026/02/womens-sizing/)
**Score:** 485 | **Comments:** 250 | **ID:** 47066552

> **Article:** The Pudding’s “Sizing chaos” visualizes how women’s clothing sizes vary wildly across brands, revealing that the median American woman has a 37‑inch waist yet often cannot find a consistent fit. By aggregating size charts from dozens of retailers, the article shows that a “size 8” can differ by up to 6 inches in waist measurement, and many popular brands simply do not carry sizes that accommodate the median body. It also highlights ancillary issues such as the near‑absence of functional pockets in women’s pants and the lack of an industry‑wide sizing standard. The piece concludes by questioning whether market forces will ever align sizing to real‑world body data.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between blaming the obesity epidemic and critiquing the fashion industry’s deliberate exclusion of average‑sized women, with some arguing that larger waist averages justify broader size ranges while others see the problem as a corporate choice to prioritize brand image over fit. Several users pointed out that the market already serves niche segments—plus‑size, tall, or petite lines—yet mainstream brands maintain “exclusive” sizing to reinforce status signaling, making better‑fitting options a low‑priority profit driver. Technical insights emerged about the difficulty of reducing women’s bodies to a single measurement, noting that shoulder‑bust‑waist‑hip ratios and height create a multidimensional fit problem that simple S‑M‑L labels cannot solve. A minority defended the current system, suggesting that billions of women manage to shop successfully and that any brand offering a more inclusive size range would face limited demand, while others called for standardized measurements and better consumer education on health and nutrition. The thread also touched on related grievances, such as the lack of pockets in women’s clothing, reinforcing the perception that design choices often sacrifice practicality for aesthetics.

## [Cosmologically Unique IDs](https://jasonfantl.com/posts/Universal-Unique-IDs/)
**Score:** 352 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 47064490

> **Article:** The article argues that a universally unique identifier (CCUID) must be large enough to avoid any chance of collision across the entire observable universe, taking into account the maximum number of IDs that could ever be generated before proton decay. By applying the birthday paradox to a hypothetical scenario where every atom receives an ID, the author concludes that roughly 800 bits of randomness are required to keep the collision probability negligible. The piece also discusses how the finite speed of light limits the causal contact between independently generated IDs, suggesting that locality should influence the design of UUID schemes. It ends by proposing a speculative “cosmological” ID format that encodes cosmic region, timestamp, and random entropy.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly challenged the article’s assumption that a naïve birthday‑paradox calculation applies universally, pointing out that collisions only matter when IDs can ever come into causal contact, which drastically reduces the needed bit length to perhaps 256 bits. Several users highlighted existing practical schemes such as Snowflake IDs and ULIDs, noting that combining timestamps with modest random fields can provide ample uniqueness without the overhead of hundreds of bits. A thread of discussion explored deterministic identifiers that embed provenance or hierarchical information, with some proposing tree‑based or content‑addressed DAG approaches as alternatives to pure randomness. Others injected physics‑level speculation—ranging from relativistic travel effects to many‑worlds interpretations—while the majority converged on the view that, given current data volumes (well under a yottabyte), 128‑ or 256‑bit IDs are more than sufficient for real‑world systems.

## [DNS-Persist-01: A New Model for DNS-Based Challenge Validation](https://letsencrypt.org/2026/02/18/dns-persist-01.html)
**Score:** 251 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 47064047

> **Article:** The Let’s Encrypt blog post introduces DNS‑PERSIST‑01, a new ACME challenge that stores a persistent DNS TXT record containing the ACME account URI to prove domain control for the certificate’s lifetime. Unlike the traditional DNS‑01 flow, the record is checked at renewal with a short TTL and can be invalidated simply by removing it, allowing CAs to cache the lookup for up to ten days. The method aims to eliminate the need for frequent DNS updates, especially for long‑lived or internal domains that lack API‑driven DNS providers. Implementation details include using the account identifier in clear text and relying on standard DNS caching behavior rather than additional cryptographic tokens.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters praised the operational simplification for environments without programmable DNS, but many raised security concerns about exposing the plain‑text account URI in a publicly queryable record. Some pointed out that any party controlling the domain’s DNS—or capable of a man‑in‑the‑middle attack on Let’s Encrypt’s DNS queries—could obtain certificates, echoing the inherent risk of DNS‑01. Others highlighted that providers like AWS Route 53 can enforce granular IAM policies (e.g., limiting record types and values) to mitigate credential leakage, while suggestions to use per‑domain accounts or random identifiers aimed to reduce correlation across sites. The debate also covered revocation mechanics, with the consensus that deleting the DNS record forces revalidation after the ten‑day cache window, though several participants argued for a shorter TTL. Overall, the community balanced the convenience of persistent validation against the trade‑offs in privacy and attack surface.

> **Discussion:** Commenters immediately split along lines of personal opinion about Colbert, with several users framing their arguments as ad hominem declarations before addressing the substantive issues of censorship and media control. A recurring theme was the Streisand effect: participants argued that suppressing the interview only fueled its viral spread, citing the massive view count and comparing the situation to China’s Great Firewall and German transparency lawsuits. The thread also veered into tangential anecdotes about corporate policies at fast‑food chains, flagging abuse, and the mechanics of online moderation, reflecting frustration with perceived tech‑elite gatekeeping. While some defended Colbert’s willingness to speak out, others warned against what they saw as “whataboutism” and called for more nuanced discourse, highlighting the polarized nature of the debate. Overall, the discussion blended political critique, media‑censorship theory, and meta‑commentary on Hacker News’s own moderation practices.
