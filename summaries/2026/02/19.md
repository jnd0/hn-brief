## [Cosmologically Unique IDs](https://jasonfantl.com/posts/Universal-Unique-IDs/)
**Score:** 438 | **Comments:** 139 | **ID:** 47064490

> **Article:** The article argues that universally unique identifiers must account for the finite lifespan of the universe, locality constraints, and the probability of collisions across all possible generations of IDs. It critiques a simplistic birthday‑paradox estimate that yields about 800 bits, showing that a more realistic bound based on the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe (~10^80) requires only around 532 bits to keep collision probability negligible. The piece also references alternative schemes such as Snowflake IDs and deterministic UUID designs that embed timestamps or locality information. It concludes that while absolute guarantees are impossible, a modest increase in bit length can make collisions astronomically unlikely for any practical or cosmological scale.
>
> **Discussion:** Participants argue that any realistic collision analysis must factor in the speed of light and the limited window of meaningful interaction before cosmic expansion isolates regions from each other. Some commenters point out that the universe will only support about 10^56 nanoseconds of computable time before proton decay, which dramatically reduces the effective number of ID generations. Others bring up practical systems like Snowflake IDs and version‑1 UUIDs, debating whether embedding timestamps or node hashes can reduce size while preserving uniqueness. A recurring theme is the tension between deterministic schemes that carry provenance and random schemes that avoid coordination, with several users noting that even 128‑bit or 256‑bit random IDs are astronomically safer than needed. The conversation also touches on the philosophical question of whether future physics or alien civilizations could alter these calculations, but most agree that for any foreseeable scenario the required bit length is far smaller than the article’s initial 800‑bit estimate.
