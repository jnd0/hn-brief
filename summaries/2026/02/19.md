## [There is unequivocal evidence that Earth is warming (2024)](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/)
**Score:** 224 | **Comments:** 268 | **ID:** 47065678

> **Article:** NASA’s 2024 climate‑change evidence page presents a suite of observations that together make the warming trend “unequivocal.” It cites satellite and ground‑based temperature records showing the global average has risen about 1.2 °C since pre‑industrial times, CO₂ concentrations now exceed 420 ppm, sea level has climbed roughly 8–9 inches since 1900, Arctic sea‑ice extent has shrunk about 13 % per decade, and ocean acidification has increased by 30 % since the 1990s. The article points to NASA Earth‑observing missions such as Terra, Aqua and GRACE as the data sources that continuously monitor these changes, and it stresses that climate models predict further warming unless greenhouse‑gas emissions are sharply reduced. It also notes that the evidence spans multiple independent lines—temperature, ice, sea level, atmospheric composition and ecosystem shifts—making the conclusion robust even when individual datasets are scrutinized. The piece concludes that the warming is driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gases and that decisive action now will avoid far higher costs later.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters agree that the warming itself is undeniable, citing NASA’s temperature records and the visible retreat of glaciers, but they diverge sharply on the attribution of that warming. Some argue that the link to CO₂ is tenuous and point to water vapor from air travel as a larger driver, while others counter that the water‑cycle contribution is orders of magnitude smaller and that CO₂’s radiative forcing is well‑documented. A recurring theme is the moral framing of climate action, with several invoking Pascal’s wager to argue that the low‑cost, high‑benefit nature of mitigation makes inaction irrational, and a few push back by noting that the wager’s logic is historically unsound and can be stretched to absurd extremes. The geopolitical dimension surfaces repeatedly, with debates over whether the United States should shoulder responsibility for historical emissions or focus on curbing the current emissions of China, which still produces more total CO₂ than any other nation. Skepticism about climate messaging surfaces in the form of accusations that ESG hype and political blame games have turned the issue into a “con job,” while others express existential resignation, suggesting humanity’s extinction is inevitable and that personal choices to limit offspring are the only rational response. Technical clarifications, such as a back‑of‑the‑napkin estimate showing air‑travel water vapor is negligible compared with natural evaporation, help ground the conversation in data, but the thread remains split between pragmatic urgency and fatalistic fatalism.
