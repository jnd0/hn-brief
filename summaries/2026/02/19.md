## [Microsoft says bug causes Copilot to summarize confidential emails](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-says-bug-causes-copilot-to-summarize-confidential-emails/)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 66 | **ID:** 47060202

> **Article:** Microsoft disclosed that a bug in its Microsoft 365 Copilot Work tab caused the AI to summarize email messages that were marked as confidential, despite sensitivity labels and DLP policies being in place. The issue, discovered internally, allowed Copilot to ingest and generate summaries of protected content, prompting Microsoft to issue a fix and reassure customers that no data was sent outside the organization. The company emphasized that the problem was limited to the summarization feature and that the underlying model was not trained on the exposed emails. Users are urged to review their DLP settings and sensitivity labels while Microsoft works on a broader solution to prevent similar retrieval‑time leaks.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters highlighted two intertwined problems: the inability to guarantee that confidential data never enters the model’s training pipeline and the fundamental mismatch between traditional access‑control models and the way Copilot retrieves information. Several argued that DLP policies are ineffective because they rely on manual classification and act only after data has already been ingested, while others pointed out that all major vendors, including OpenAI, paraphrase user inputs for training, making data leakage a systemic risk. Technical insight from SignalStackDev emphasized that the only reliable safeguard is pre‑retrieval filtering, where a structured query is vetted against a permission layer before any content reaches the LLM’s context window. The community also debated Microsoft’s use of the term “advisory” to downplay the incident, with lich_king noting that advisories are deliberately limited to avoid regulatory scrutiny and that the company rarely publishes full incident reports. A few users expressed broader frustration, joking about switching to Linux or watching The Matrix, while others warned that the pattern of retrofitting human‑centric permission models onto AI agents will keep producing bugs.

## [DNS-Persist-01: A New Model for DNS-Based Challenge Validation](https://letsencrypt.org/2026/02/18/dns-persist-01.html)
**Score:** 223 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 47064047

> **Article:** Let's Encrypt has introduced a new DNS-based challenge validation method called DNS-PERSIST-01 that allows certificate issuers to cache DNS record lookups for up to 10 days instead of rechecking them for every certificate issuance. The method involves creating a specific DNS record containing the ACME account URI, which serves as proof of domain control that remains valid until the record is removed. This approach addresses the operational pain point of frequent DNS-01 challenge validation while maintaining security through the requirement that the account's private key is still needed to issue certificates.
>
> **Discussion:** The community response was mixed, with many expressing excitement about solving operational challenges while raising security concerns. Several users pointed out that exposing account URIs in DNS records could enable reverse lookups and correlation between domains, though others noted this information is already exposed in certificates. Technical debates emerged around the 10-day caching period, with some preferring shorter intervals for security, and discussions about whether the account URI should be replaced with a random identifier or public key. Users shared practical workarounds like using AWS Route53's granular API permissions and bind's update policies to limit the scope of compromised credentials. The conversation also touched on broader DNS infrastructure issues, with suggestions for alternative DNS providers and debates about the security implications of DNS-based certificate issuance in general.
