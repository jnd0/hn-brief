The EU's latest crusade against digital addiction has reached its inevitable absurdity with the move to "kill infinite scrolling." As if our tech overlords would simply comply with bureaucratic whims rather than paying lip service while continuing business as usual, the Commission targets what they claim is an addictive design practice without proposing any actual laws against it. The real irony here is that they're focusing on the scrollbar—a red herring that doesn't address the core issue: the advertising business model that underpins nearly every "free" service we use. If the EU were serious about digital well-being, they'd go after the monetization that creates perverse incentives for engagement at all costs. But that would threaten the economic foundations of their own digital ecosystem, so instead we get performative regulation that allows politicians to posture while changing nothing fundamental.

Meanwhile, OpenAI continues its transformation from idealistic non-profit to profit-seeking machine, quietly dropping "safely" from its mission statement. This didn't happen in isolation; it follows the removal of persuasion and manipulation from their Tracked Categories earlier this year. The pattern is unmistakable: safety concerns take a backseat when the competitive landscape heats up and venture capitalists start demanding returns. The sycophancy problem where AI models become overly agreeable to users isn't just a technical quirk—it's a feature when your business model relies on keeping users engaged rather than providing accurate information. And let's not forget that the only reason safety was ever a priority was because OpenAI had no competition; now that Google and others are breathing down their necks, those inconvenient ethical considerations become… flexible.

These two stories reveal the same underlying tension: the impossible balance between ethical principles and market forces. When regulators target infinite scrolling but not advertising, and when AI companies drop safety language but not profit motives, we're watching the same movie with slightly different subtitles. The tech industry has mastered the art of saying the right things while building systems that exploit human psychology for profit. What's remarkable isn't that these compromises are happening, but how transparent they've become. The masks are off, and yet we're expected to believe that everything's still fine as long as the mission statement looks vaguely progressive.

The world of tech journalism took another hit this week with Ars Technica's remarkable decision to publish an article containing fabricated quotes generated by an AI tool—a move that would be comical if it weren't so concerning. What makes this particularly pathetic isn't just that they used AI-generated quotes (which is bad enough), but that they've been steadily declining in quality since their Condé Nast acquisition years ago. Long-time users remember when Ars employed actual experts who understood the technology they were writing about, not just journalists regurgating press releases with occasional technical buzzwords sprinkled in for credibility. The comment sections have devolved into echo chambers, the articles increasingly read like PR pieces, and now we have AI fabrications completing the trifecta of journalistic malpractice.

The broader pattern here isn't isolated to Ars Technica. The entire media landscape is struggling with the AI transition: either leaning into it without proper safeguards (like Ars did), or panicking and banning AI entirely without understanding how to regulate its use responsibly. Meanwhile, the most skilled human writers are being let go or replaced with cheaper, less knowledgeable alternatives. What's particularly galling is the lack of accountability—Ars pulled the story without providing any meaningful explanation of how it happened or what changes they'll implement to prevent recurrence. It's the same pattern we see across tech: failures are acknowledged, lessons are not learned, and business continues as usual.

Speaking of privacy violations, some enterprising engineer discovered that a smart sleep mask is broadcasting users' brainwave data to an open MQTT for all the world to see. The sheer gall of IoT manufacturers continues to astonish—they'll harvest sensitive biometric data, use hardcoded credentials, and then broadcast it to the internet with the security sophistication of a teenager's first web project. The neuroscientists in the comments are rightfully horrified—EEG data is incredibly sensitive, potentially revealing medical conditions, cognitive states, and even thoughts in some contexts. What's particularly impressive is that the manufacturer appears to have built a sleep tracking device that's not just privacy-invasive, but technically incompetent.

The reverse engineering process reveals a classic IoT failure story: the app was decompiled, Bluetooth protocols were probed, and the entire security architecture was found to be practically nonexistent. Hardcoded credentials, unencrypted data transmission, no authentication—this isn't just a bug; it's a feature. What's genuinely disturbing is that this isn't an isolated incident. The same pattern repeats across every IoT device category: smart speakers, security cameras, even refrigerators—all designed to collect data with minimal regard for user privacy or security. The market has consistently rewarded cheap, convenient products over secure, private ones, and we're all paying the price.

The concept of digital preservation continues its downward spiral as publishers increasingly block the Internet Archive and similar services. The tension here is fascinating: publishers want to control access to their content while preventing AI training, but in doing so they're eroding the historical record that future generations will need. Brewster Kahle makes the obvious point—libraries are fundamental to our cultural memory—but this argument falls on deaf ears in a world where quarterly reports matter more than historical context. The proposed Wikipedia-style platform for news is an interesting idea, but fundamentally misunderstands the economics of professional journalism. Wikipedia works precisely because it doesn't attempt to replace professional reporting; it summarizes and contextualizes it.

What's particularly insidious about this trend is how it intersects with AI. Publishers aren't just blocking AI scrapers; they're blocking the very preservation tools that would allow us to verify AI outputs in the future. Imagine a world where AI systems are trained on increasingly narrow, curated datasets while the raw material of the internet becomes inaccessible—a perfect recipe for algorithmic hallucinations that can never be fact-checked. The irony is that the same companies creating these AI systems are contributing to the information decay that will make their products less useful over time.

On a brighter note, the Zig language continues its steady march toward 1.0 with implementations of io_uring and Grand Central Dispatch for cross-platform async I/O. What's interesting isn't the technical achievement itself (which is impressive), but the ongoing debate about whether to use Zig before it reaches 1.0. The skeptics raise valid points—frequent breaking changes and rewrites make it challenging for production code—while proponents make the case that for performance-critical workloads, the potential cost savings (some claim 90% reduction in cloud compute) outweigh the stability concerns. This debate mirrors the tension between innovation and stability that we see across the entire software landscape.

The YouTube-as-storage project represents a fascinating exercise in constraint-based thinking—encoding files into video frames using fountain codes and uploading them to YouTube. Technically clever, but practically questionable given YouTube's terms of service and compression algorithms that would likely corrupt the data. Still, it's a reminder that the most interesting innovations often emerge at the edges of what's possible, even if they're not immediately practical. The project highlights how developers continue to exploit platform limitations, turning services designed for one purpose into tools for entirely different uses—a pattern we've seen everywhere from Twitter as a blogging platform to Discord as a community hub.

What emerges from today's stories is the familiar pattern of technological advancement outpacing our ability to govern it. Whether it's infinite scrolling, AI safety, IoT privacy, or digital preservation, we're building tools that affect society at scale while developing governance mechanisms that are either nonexistent or toothless. The EU's approach to infinite scrolling is emblematic of this disconnect—targeting surface-level symptoms while ignoring the systemic drivers. Similarly, OpenAI's mission statement changes reflect a common pattern where ethics becomes a luxury once market pressures intensify.

Perhaps what's most concerning isn't any individual story, but the sheer velocity of change across all these domains. Privacy boundaries are shifting, information is becoming less accessible, and the tools we rely on are increasingly optimized for engagement and profit rather than human wellbeing. The pace of change means that by the time any regulatory framework catches up, the technology has moved on, leaving us perpetually playing catch-up.

Worth watching: Sameshi, the 2KB chess engine that achieves 1,200 Elo by disabling castling, en-passant, and promotions—a fascinating exercise in minimalist design that asks what's really essential in a game engine.
