> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly debated the usefulness of the Ã¢ÂÂYIYBYÃ¢ÂÂ label, with some arguing that any development is inherently YIMBY and that the term merely restates the NIMBY mindset. A recurring theme was the tension between local democratic decisions and broader regional housing needs, with users like rsync and Retric questioning whether outcomes that exclude affected residents can still be called democratic. Several participants pointed to practical consequences of lowÃ¢ÂÂdensity zoningÃ¢ÂÂsuch as traffic, parking shortages, and the scarcity of walkable corner shopsÃ¢ÂÂwhile others, like colechristensen and joshuaheard, defended density limits as essential for preserving neighborhood character and preventing investorÃ¢ÂÂdriven housing markets. The discussion also touched on freeÃ¢ÂÂspeech concerns, suggesting that legal challenges to NIMBY activism may chill advocacy, and debated the geographic logic of placing new units in places like RanchoÃ¢ÂÂ¯PalosÃ¢ÂÂ¯Verdes versus more suitable nearby cities. Throughout, the thread reflected a split between idealistic YIMBY optimism and grounded skepticism about the real costs and benefits of densification.

## [Fraud investigation is believing your lying eyes](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/fraud-investigation/)
**Score:** 122 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 46915587

> **Article:** The article examines a massive fraud scandal in MinnesotaÃ¢ÂÂs childÃ¢ÂÂcare subsidy program, highlighting a YouTube expose by Nick Shirley that alleged overÃ¢ÂÂbilling and falsified attendance records at dozens of centers. It cites a state audit claiming a Ã¢ÂÂmore than 50Ã¢ÂÂ¯% fraud rateÃ¢ÂÂ based on internal estimates and describes how officials conducted compliance checks at nine facilities while keeping Ã¢ÂÂongoing investigationsÃ¢ÂÂ at four others. The piece critiques the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on Ã¢ÂÂpayÃ¢ÂÂandÃ¢ÂÂchaseÃ¢ÂÂ reimbursement tactics, arguing they are costly and ineffective compared to preÃ¢ÂÂauthorization reforms that have cut fraud by 68Ã¢ÂÂ¯% in similar Medicare programs. It also notes the political fallout, including a federal Senate hearing that referenced the video and a controversial deployment of thousands of ICE agents.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters debated the credibility of the 50Ã¢ÂÂ¯% fraud figure, with some pointing to the original audit by CCAP investigations manager Jay Swanson and others questioning its methodology and lack of criminal convictions. Several users argued that MinnesotaÃ¢ÂÂs response was either too laxÃ¢ÂÂciting continued investigations and minimal prosecutionsÃ¢ÂÂor, conversely, that the state had already taken aggressive legal action, referencing ongoing prosecutions and legislative efforts. The thread also examined the efficacy of Ã¢ÂÂpayÃ¢ÂÂandÃ¢ÂÂchaseÃ¢ÂÂ versus priorÃ¢ÂÂauthorization models, noting research showing a 68Ã¢ÂÂ¯% fraud reduction when payments are vetted in advance. A side dispute emerged over the claim that the video prompted a massive ICE deployment, with participants correcting the timeline and clarifying that most arrests targeted undocumented immigrants rather than fraudsters. Overall, the discussion reflected tension between blaming systemic government weakness and attributing the scandalÃ¢ÂÂs exposure to sensationalist journalism.

## [LLMs could be, but shouldn't be compilers](https://alperenkeles.com/posts/llms-could-be-but-shouldnt-be-compilers/)
**Score:** 110 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46912781

> **Article:** The article argues that while LLMs technically could be used as compilers to translate natural language into executable code, they fundamentally should not be. The author contends that the core issue is not determinism but that LLMs are "functionally underspecified by default," meaning their outputs are not guaranteed to be semantically correct or consistent. The piece contrasts this with traditional compilers, which operate on precise, unambiguous specifications to produce reliable results. It ultimately frames the use of LLMs for this purpose as forcing a square peg into a round hole, prioritizing a flawed interface over a proper engineering solution.
>
> **Discussion:** The conversation centered on whether non-determinism is the primary disqualifier for LLMs acting as compilers. One prominent technical insight challenged the initial premise, arguing that the crucial property for a compiler is not determinism—which many non-deterministic systems possess—but "semantic closure," where outputs are fully defined and correctness is internally verifiable, a quality LLMs lack. While some participants countered that determinism is essential for debugging and reproducible builds, others noted that many modern software systems, like JIT compilers, are already heuristic-driven and not perfectly deterministic. A deeper philosophical debate emerged about the nature of programming itself, with some arguing that since developers test the final output regardless of the toolchain, LLM-generated code is no different from compiler-generated machine code, while others insisted that the unpredictability of LLMs introduces an unacceptable level of unreliability. The community reaction was sharply divided, ranging from those who found the discussion obvious to those engaging in nuanced comparisons between software engineering principles and the emergent behavior of AI systems.

## [C isn't a programming language anymore (2022)](https://faultlore.com/blah/c-isnt-a-language/)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46907350

> **Article:** The article argues that C has ceased to be a conventional programming language and now functions primarily as a universal interface and ABI for system software. It points out that the massive amount of existing infrastructure written in C forces developers to work within CÃ¢ÂÂs constraints even when they never intend to write C code themselves. The author cites the prevalence of C in operating system kernels, drivers, and lowÃ¢ÂÂlevel libraries as evidence that CÃ¢ÂÂs role has shifted from language to lingua franca for interoperability. The piece suggests that this situation raises the question of whether a purposeÃ¢ÂÂbuilt interÃ¢ÂÂprocess interface could replace CÃ¢ÂÂs deÃ¢ÂÂfacto status.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between defending CÃ¢ÂÂs historical dominance and criticizing the articleÃ¢ÂÂs tone, with pizlonator calling the post Ã¢ÂÂwhinyÃ¢ÂÂ and urging more curiosity about why C became foundational. Several participants, including drnick1 and stackghost, emphasized that CÃ¢ÂÂs minimal reflection of hardwareÃ¢ÂÂoriginally the PDPÃ¢ÂÂ11 architectureÃ¢ÂÂmade it a natural portable bridge, though others noted that modern CPUs have added layers of abstraction that weaken this argument. Technical grievances surfaced around CÃ¢ÂÂs type system, as smallstepforman and 1718627440 debated the merits of unspecified default sizes versus explicit fixedÃ¢ÂÂwidth types. A broader cultural thread emerged from okanat and mjg59, who argued that shifts toward higherÃ¢ÂÂlevel ecosystems, HTTP/JSON APIs, and declining systemsÃ¢ÂÂprogramming research have cemented CÃ¢ÂÂs legacy role, while also questioning whether newer languages or interfaces could realistically supplant it.
