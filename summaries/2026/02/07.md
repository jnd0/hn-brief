> **Article:** The article argues that C has ceased to be a conventional programming language and now functions primarily as a universal interface and ABI for system software. It points out that the massive amount of existing infrastructure written in C forces developers to work within Câs constraints even when they never intend to write C code themselves. The author cites the prevalence of C in operating system kernels, drivers, and lowâlevel libraries as evidence that Câs role has shifted from language to lingua franca for interoperability. The piece suggests that this situation raises the question of whether a purposeâbuilt interâprocess interface could replace Câs deâfacto status.

> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between defending Câs historical dominance and criticizing the articleâs tone, with pizlonator calling the post âwhinyâ and urging more curiosity about why C became foundational. Several participants, including drnick1 and stackghost, emphasized that Câs minimal reflection of hardwareâoriginally the PDPâ11 architectureâmade it a natural portable bridge, though others noted that modern CPUs have added layers of abstraction that weaken this argument. Technical grievances surfaced around Câs type system, as smallstepforman and 1718627440 debated the merits of unspecified default sizes versus explicit fixedâwidth types. A broader cultural thread emerged from okanat and mjg59, who argued that shifts toward higherâlevel ecosystems, HTTP/JSON APIs, and declining systemsâprogramming research have cemented Câs legacy role, while also questioning whether newer languages or interfaces could realistically supplant it.
