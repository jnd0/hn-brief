## [Things Unix can do atomically (2010)](https://rcrowley.org/2010/01/06/things-unix-can-do-atomically.html)
**Score:** 243 | **Comments:** 89 | **ID:** 46909468

> **Article:** The 2010 article catalogs operations that POSIX‑compatible Unix‑like systems can perform atomically, such as creating a file with O_CREAT | O_EXCL, renaming or linking files, and using fcntl‑based advisory locks (F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW). It highlights that rename(2) is guaranteed to be an atomic replacement of a pathname, and notes Linux‑specific extensions like mandatory locking and the limitations of certain file‑system behaviours. The author frames the list as a practical reference for developers needing reliable single‑step filesystem actions.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly expanded the list, noting modern tools like Linux’s renameat2 + RENAME_EXCHANGE (exposed as mv --exchange) that allow atomic swapping of two paths, a feature the original post missed. A debate emerged over the article’s “Unix” label, with some insisting it should only cover POSIX standards while others argued Linux‑specific behaviours belong in the discussion, especially regarding lock reliability and mandatory locking quirks. Practical deployment strategies were shared, from using symlink indirection in Nix and GNU Stow to Chrome’s update mechanism and phone OS dual‑filesystem snapshots, though one user dismissed symlink‑based rollouts as unrealistic for their workflow. The thread also dissected the atomicity of O_APPEND writes, with differing views on whether filesystem bugs or required flags like O_SYNC affect guarantees, and clarified that advisory locks (flock, fcntl) only work when all processes cooperate. Finally, participants questioned whether true multi‑object transactions are possible, suggesting higher‑level approaches such as at‑family syscalls, inotify/watchman, or custom virtual filesystems for conditional atomic actions.

## [C isn't a programming language anymore (2022)](https://faultlore.com/blah/c-isnt-a-language/)
**Score:** 106 | **Comments:** 166 | **ID:** 46907350

> **Article:** The article argues that C has ceased to be a conventional programming language and now functions primarily as a universal interface and ABI for system software. It points out that the massive amount of existing infrastructure written in C forces developers to work within C’s constraints even when they never intend to write C code themselves. The author cites the prevalence of C in operating system kernels, drivers, and low‑level libraries as evidence that C’s role has shifted from language to lingua franca for interoperability. The piece suggests that this situation raises the question of whether a purpose‑built inter‑process interface could replace C’s de‑facto status.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between defending C’s historical dominance and criticizing the article’s tone, with pizlonator calling the post “whiny” and urging more curiosity about why C became foundational. Several participants, including drnick1 and stackghost, emphasized that C’s minimal reflection of hardware—originally the PDP‑11 architecture—made it a natural portable bridge, though others noted that modern CPUs have added layers of abstraction that weaken this argument. Technical grievances surfaced around C’s type system, as smallstepforman and 1718627440 debated the merits of unspecified default sizes versus explicit fixed‑width types. A broader cultural thread emerged from okanat and mjg59, who argued that shifts toward higher‑level ecosystems, HTTP/JSON APIs, and declining systems‑programming research have cemented C’s legacy role, while also questioning whether newer languages or interfaces could realistically supplant it.
