## [C isn't a programming language anymore (2022)](https://faultlore.com/blah/c-isnt-a-language/)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 164 | **ID:** 46907350

> **Article:** The article argues that C has ceased to be a conventional programming language and now functions primarily as a universal interface and ABI for system software. It points out that C’s design was tightly coupled to the PDP‑11 architecture and that modern hardware abstractions have long outpaced its original model. The author claims that despite numerous alternatives, C’s entrenched role in legacy code, operating system kernels, and cross‑language bindings keeps it indispensable. A concrete example given is the reliance on C for in‑process interoperability, such as the mechanisms used by cgo and foreign function interfaces.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between defending C’s historical dominance—citing Unix and Windows’s early adoption—and questioning whether that legacy justifies its continued primacy. mjg59 emphasizes that C now serves as the de‑facto interoperability layer, forcing developers to confront its constraints even when they never intend to write C code. Others, like drnick1 and stackghost, note that C only minimally mirrors modern hardware, with its abstraction rooted in PDP‑11 rather than current CPU micro‑architectures. Critics such as smallstepforman and 1718627440 debate C’s type system, arguing over whether fixed‑width integer types should have been built in from the start.

## [LLMs could be, but shouldn't be compilers](https://alperenkeles.com/posts/llms-could-be-but-shouldnt-be-compilers/)
**Score:** 104 | **Comments:** 112 | **ID:** 46912781

> **Article:** The article argues that while large language models (LLMs) have the theoretical capacity to translate natural‑language specifications into executable code, they should not be treated as compilers. It highlights that LLMs are fundamentally nondeterministic and often produce hallucinations, making reliable, repeatable builds impossible. The author cites the need for precise, deterministic specifications—something English cannot provide efficiently—as a core reason to reject LLMs as compilation tools. A concrete point made is that even with temperature set to zero and a fixed seed, the underlying model’s stochastic training still leads to unpredictable behavior.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly focused on determinism, with codingdave and rvz insisting that the stochastic nature of LLMs disqualifies them as compilers, while CGMthrowaway countered that determinism is not essential; instead, a compiler must be semantically closed, guaranteeing that any output belongs to a well‑defined equivalence class. Several participants, such as moregrist and thwarted, emphasized the practical need for reproducible builds and exact repeatability, arguing that nondeterministic code generation would cripple debugging. Others, like raw_anon_1111 and mickdarling, drew parallels to human oversight, suggesting that the same verification processes applied to people could be used for LLM outputs, though skeptics like bigstrat2003 warned that introducing random errors defeats the purpose of computers. The thread also touched on performance concerns, with rileymichael noting that low‑level optimizations still matter on platforms like the JVM, while skydhash argued that most developers aren’t performance‑sensitive, making the reliability debate more about correctness than speed. Throughout, there was consensus that the core issue is not merely randomness but the lack of a well‑specified interface and predictable semantics from LLM‑generated code.

One example is 26‑year‑old Murmu from Jharkhand, who earns about US $350 a month—far more than the $130–150 she could make sewing fast‑fashion garments or the $100 she might earn from piece‑work agriculture. The article argues that, despite the psychological toll, such jobs provide a rare source of income and digital inclusion in regions previously plagued by poverty, land‑lord exploitation and even Maoist insurgency. It also notes that as AI improves, these moderation roles could be automated, potentially eliminating the current “least‑bad” employment option for many rural women.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters split between defending the work as a pragmatic lifeline and condemning it as modern‑day exploitation. Some users, like simianwords, stress that the wages and autonomy outweigh the distress of viewing abusive content, framing the jobs as essential progress for impoverished communities. Others, such as pinnochio and unstyledcontent, highlight the severe mental‑health risks and question whether material gains justify exposing workers to trauma, urging a re‑examination of the underlying labor model. A recurring theme is the accusation of neocolonialism and “bonded labour” by foreign tech firms, while contributors like alephnerd and lazide point out that alternatives in remote Jharkhand—manual farm labor, factory shifts, or even joining insurgent groups—are often far worse. The debate also touches on the ethics of “volunteering” for such roles and whether the industry should invest in better safeguards or seek to eliminate the need for human moderation altogether.
