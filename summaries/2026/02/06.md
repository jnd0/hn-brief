## [We tasked Opus 4.6 using agent teams to build a C Compiler](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler)
**Score:** 501 | **Comments:** 467 | **ID:** 46903616

> **Article:** Anthropic’s blog post describes how they used the Opus 4.6 model, orchestrated by autonomous agent teams, to generate a from‑scratch C compiler written in Rust. Over roughly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and about $20,000 in API usage, the model produced a 100 k‑line compiler capable of building Linux 6.9 for x86, ARM, and RISC‑V, as well as large projects such as QEMU, FFmpeg, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Redis. The authors note that the compiler can compile the kernel but still relies on GCC for a 16‑bit boot stub and that its generated code is less efficient than GCC even with all optimizations disabled. The post frames the effort as a proof‑of‑concept pushing the limits of current LLM capabilities.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters praised the achievement as a striking demonstration that an LLM can produce a functional, clean‑room compiler, yet many highlighted its practical shortcomings, especially the poor optimization quality and the need to fall back to GCC for the 16‑bit boot stage. A recurring debate centered on whether the result constitutes plagiarism, with some arguing that the model cannot reproduce code verbatim but may still be heavily influenced by the vast corpus of existing compilers it was trained on. The $20 k cost and the uncertainty about hidden bugs sparked skepticism about the project’s viability for production use, while others compared the expense to human development effort and suggested early‑stage AI tools are still worth exploring. Overall, the thread balanced admiration for the technical milestone with caution regarding performance, legal, and economic implications.

## [LinkedIn checks for 2953 browser extensions](https://github.com/mdp/linkedin-extension-fingerprinting)
**Score:** 381 | **Comments:** 185 | **ID:** 46904361

> **Article:** The GitHub project “linkedin-extension-fingerprinting” documents how LinkedIn probes browsers for up to 2,953 installed Chrome extensions by requesting their web‑accessible resources. By constructing URLs of the form chrome‑extension://[extension‑ID]/[path] the site can infer which extensions are present, effectively fingerprinting users. The repository includes a compiled list of the targeted extensions, many of which are LinkedIn scrapers or automation tools such as “Apollo Scraper” and “LinkedGPT”. LinkedIn uses this data to detect and block automated activity and potentially to track users across sessions.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters noted that the extension list is dominated by tools for scraping and mass outreach, confirming LinkedIn’s motive to curb abuse that threatens its revenue streams. Several users highlighted that Firefox is immune because its extension IDs are randomly generated per profile, whereas Chrome’s stable IDs enable reliable fingerprinting. Ethical concerns were raised about LinkedIn’s privacy intrusion and the likelihood that the data was harvested by violating Chrome Web Store terms, while others argued that protecting a platform from malicious bots is a legitimate business need. Technical debate surfaced around whether swapping extension‑specific IDs for browser‑specific ones could uniquely identify individuals, with consensus that Chrome’s deterministic IDs make such tracking feasible. Finally, participants called for patches or browser‑level defenses, noting that ad‑blockers like uBlock Origin already evade detection by using dynamic URLs, and urging both LinkedIn and extension developers to mitigate the vulnerability.
