## [We tasked Opus 4.6 using agent teams to build a C Compiler](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler)
**Score:** 592 | **Comments:** 577 | **ID:** 46903616

> **Article:** Anthropic’s blog post details how the Opus 4.6 large‑language model, orchestrated with autonomous agent teams, was used to generate a 100 000‑line Rust‑based C compiler from scratch. The compiler, built without any internet access, can compile the Linux 6.9 kernel for x86, ARM and RISC‑V, as well as large projects such as QEMU, FFmpeg, SQLite, PostgreSQL and Redis. The effort required roughly 2 000 Claude code sessions and cost about $20 000 in API usage. Despite succeeding in building a bootable system, the generated code is noticeably less efficient than GCC, and the tool lacks a native 16‑bit x86 backend, resorting to GCC for that stage.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters praised the technical achievement, noting that producing a functional compiler that can handle real‑world codebases is a milestone for generative AI, while others highlighted the practical shortcomings such as poor optimization performance and reliance on external tools for bootstrapping. A debate emerged over the claim of a “clean‑room” implementation, with some arguing that the model inevitably draws on patterns from its training data and may inadvertently replicate existing compiler code, whereas others pointed out that the LLM does not store verbatim source but synthesizes knowledge. The $20 000 cost and the question of economic viability sparked criticism, with some comparing it unfavorably to a single engineer’s effort, while others reminded that early‑stage tech often incurs losses before scaling. Additional concerns were raised about potential security implications, such as AI‑embedded compilers echoing the “Trusting Trust” scenario, and speculation about future models that could produce more efficient, self‑contained compilers without external dependencies. Overall, the community acknowledged the experiment’s significance but remained skeptical about its readiness for production use.
