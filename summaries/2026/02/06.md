## [It's 2026, Just Use Postgres](https://www.tigerdata.com/blog/its-2026-just-use-postgres)
**Score:** 499 | **Comments:** 308 | **ID:** 46905555

> **Article:** The TigerData blog post argues that by 2026 PostgreSQL has matured enough to serve as the default data platform for most applications, citing its built‑in JSONB, full‑text search, and emerging vector‑search capabilities that eliminate the need for separate specialized stores. It claims a single Postgres stack simplifies architecture, reduces operational overhead, and can handle workloads from OLTP to analytics without adding extra services. The author also promotes TigerData’s managed Postgres offering as a turnkey solution that abstracts tuning and scaling concerns. Implicit in the piece is a call for teams to default to Postgres before considering niche databases or caches.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly pushed back against the “just use Postgres” mantra, warning that it masks the hidden CAPEX and OPEX of scaling Postgres beyond its design limits and that purpose‑built systems like ClickHouse, Redis, or MySQL still provide measurable benefits for high‑throughput or specialized workloads. Several users highlighted operational pain points such as constant vacuuming, permission quirks in managed clouds, and the larger on‑disk footprint of PostgreSQL rows, while others praised its ease of use for exploratory tasks and small‑scale services, sometimes preferring SQLite for ultimate simplicity. A side debate emerged over the authenticity of the article, with accusations that the post was AI‑generated and calls for transparency about LLM use.

## [LinkedIn checks for 2953 browser extensions](https://github.com/mdp/linkedin-extension-fingerprinting)
**Score:** 493 | **Comments:** 229 | **ID:** 46904361

> **Article:** The GitHub project mdp/linkedin-extension-fingerprinting documents how LinkedIn probes a visitor’s browser for up to 2,953 installed Chrome extensions by requesting their web‑accessible resources via URLs of the form chrome‑extension://<extension‑ID>/<path>. The technique relies on the fact that Chrome exposes each extension’s ID and resources to any webpage, while Firefox generates a per‑profile random UUID that prevents the same fingerprinting. LinkedIn uses the gathered data to infer the presence of automation or scraping tools, potentially flagging or blocking users. The repository includes the full list of detected extensions, many of which are marketed as LinkedIn scrapers, AI assistants, or lead‑generation tools.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly noted that Firefox is effectively immune because its extension IDs are randomized per installation, whereas Chrome’s static IDs make the fingerprinting feasible. Several users argued that the practice turns a browser’s extension set into a unique personal identifier, raising privacy concerns and prompting debate over whether LinkedIn’s motive is bot detection, anti‑scraping enforcement, or broader user tracking. Technical explanations highlighted that extensions like uBlock Origin deliberately hide their resources, rendering them invisible to LinkedIn’s scan, and some participants questioned the security implications of cross‑origin requests to the Chrome Web Store. The thread also featured broader criticism of LinkedIn and Google for exploiting such mechanisms, with suggestions that browsers should block these probes or that extension developers add protective settings. Overall, the discussion blended technical clarification, ethical objections, and calls for stronger privacy safeguards.

## [A new bill in New York would require disclaimers on AI-generated news content](https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/02/a-new-bill-in-new-york-would-require-disclaimers-on-ai-generated-news-content/)
**Score:** 395 | **Comments:** 147 | **ID:** 46910963

> **Article:** A bill introduced in the New York State Senate would require any news article that is “substantially composed, authored, or created through the use of generative artificial intelligence” to carry a clear disclaimer stating that AI was used. The legislation cites the need for transparency in the face of growing AI‑generated content and has garnered support from news unions and guilds that see labeling as a way to protect journalistic integrity. Proponents argue the rule will help readers distinguish human‑written reporting from machine‑generated text, while critics warn it could raise First Amendment challenges and create a costly compliance burden for publishers. The bill is part of a broader wave of state‑level AI regulations, including NY’s RAISE safety framework and the SAFE for Kids Act.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly framed the bill as just one piece of a rapidly expanding New York AI regulatory landscape, with padolsey enumerating related statutes such as RAISE, S8420A, and the SAFE for Kids Act. Many expressed skepticism about enforceability, noting that without technical means to detect AI use, the law may rely on voluntary compliance and could punish honest publishers disproportionately, as raincole and crimsonsupe argued. mbreese highlighted the free‑speech tension, suggesting that a union‑driven labeling system might achieve the same goal without running afoul of constitutional protections. Others warned the disclaimer requirement could devolve into a “Prop 65”‑style over‑warning, diluting its impact, while Llamamoe and several participants insisted that passing AI‑generated content as human should be illegal outright. The thread also touched on practical concerns, such as whether minor edits or spell‑checking count as “substantial” AI involvement and how the rule might affect employment and liability in the newsroom.

## [The RCE that AMD won't fix](https://mrbruh.com/amd/)
**Score:** 332 | **Comments:** 141 | **ID:** 46906947

> **Article:** The article details a remote‑code‑execution (RCE) vulnerability in AMD’s driver auto‑update utility, which downloads update binaries over plain HTTP from an unencrypted URL. Because the download can be intercepted and altered via a man‑in‑the‑middle attack—such as DNS cache poisoning or BGP hijacking—an attacker could execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on any system running the updater. AMD’s response, quoted in the piece, labels the flaw as “out of scope” for its bug‑bounty program and indicates no intention to patch it. The author argues that this stance effectively leaves millions of AMD GPU users exposed to a trivial network‑level exploit.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly framed the issue as a symptom of broader industry neglect, contrasting the proactive security posture of Linux distributions, which bundle drivers and avoid such update mechanisms, with AMD’s apparent complacency. A recurring theme was the disagreement over AMD’s “out of scope” classification: some users condemned it as indefensible incompetence, while others pointed out that bug‑bounty programs are not guarantees of fixes for every exploit. Technical debate centered on the exploit’s practicality, with participants noting that a compromised DNS or a simple rogue Wi‑Fi hotspot could deliver malicious payloads, and that unsigned HTTP updates are a fundamental security flaw. The thread also broadened to critique hardware vendors’ software practices, cite similar issues in other OEM tools, and discuss the economics of security versus rapid hardware releases, highlighting a split between calls for immediate remediation and acceptance of corporate risk assessments.

> **Article:** Scott Aaronson recounts a narrowly avoided encounter with Jeffrey Epstein, describing how he was invited to a private dinner that would have placed him among a network of wealthy donors, scientists, and political figures linked to Epstein’s controversial activities. He explains that the invitation came through a mutual acquaintance involved in a quantum‑computing initiative funded by Epstein’s charitable foundation, and that he ultimately declined after learning about Epstein’s alleged sex‑trafficking allegations. Aaronson reflects on the moral dilemmas faced by academics when lucrative funding sources are tied to illicit behavior, noting that many high‑profile researchers have either accepted or rejected such support. The post uses this personal anecdote to explore broader questions about power, corruption, and the responsibility of the scientific community.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly turned the anecdote into a broader debate over how power corrupts, with several users invoking the classic “power corrupts” maxim and arguing that limited terms, taxation, and antitrust regulation are the only viable antidotes. A heated sub‑thread focused on Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation, contrasting his massive charitable giving with accusations that the foundation serves as a tax‑avoidance vehicle and a conduit for political influence, while others defended philanthropy as a net good. Speculation about Epstein’s connections to intelligence agencies—particularly Mossad and possible Russian ties—sparked a back‑and‑forth about the plausibility of state‑sponsored sex‑trafficking networks, with users citing his email attempts to secure a Russian visa and his relationship with UK ambassador Peter Mandelson. The discussion also touched on wealth inequality, with participants arguing that higher taxes on the ultra‑rich would reduce corruption, while skeptics warned that simply raising taxes could merely shift power to bureaucrats. Throughout, commenters mixed moral outrage with attempts at nuanced analysis, but consensus remained elusive, leaving the thread marked by both ideological clashes and occasional factual clarifications.

## [Things Unix can do atomically (2010)](https://rcrowley.org/2010/01/06/things-unix-can-do-atomically.html)
**Score:** 210 | **Comments:** 81 | **ID:** 46909468

> **Article:** The 2010 article catalogs operations that Unix‑like systems can perform atomically, such as creating files with O_EXCL, linking and unlinking, renaming a single pathname, and swapping a symlink target to achieve zero‑downtime deployments. It notes that the rename(2) system call replaces a pathname atomically, and highlights the use of advisory file locks (fcntl F_SETLK/F_SETLKW) for coordinated access. The author also points out limitations, for example that atomicity applies to one file at a time and does not extend to multi‑object transactions. A concrete example given is using a symlink that points to a new directory to switch live code without intermediate states.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly expanded the list with newer Linux‑only primitives such as mv --exchange (renameat2 RENAME_EXCHANGE), sparking a debate over whether the article’s “Unix” scope should include Linux extensions. Several users defended the classic symlink‑swap deployment model, citing real‑world use in Nix, GNU Stow, and Chrome’s update mechanism, while others argued that relying on a single‑file atomic rename can still leave race windows when multiple operations are needed. The thread also delved into the nuances of O_APPEND writes, with one side insisting it is universally atomic on POSIX filesystems, and another stressing crash‑consistency concerns that require fsync on parent directories. File‑locking mechanisms like fcntl and flock were mentioned, and participants discussed practical tooling such as inotify, incron, and custom virtual filesystems for conditional actions. Overall, the conversation highlighted both the enduring relevance of the article’s core concepts and the evolution of atomic filesystem primitives in modern Linux environments.

## [Systems Thinking](http://theprogrammersparadox.blogspot.com/2026/02/systems-thinking.html)
**Score:** 208 | **Comments:** 100 | **ID:** 46909439

> **Article:** The blog post “Systems Thinking” revisits Gall’s Law, asserting that a functional complex system must evolve from a simpler, already‑working system, and that building a complex system from scratch rarely succeeds. It contrasts this principle with the practice of large‑scale software projects that attempt exhaustive up‑front specifications, arguing that such approaches ignore the dynamic, evolving nature of real‑world requirements. The author cites examples from both software engineering and mechanical engineering to illustrate where the law holds and where it breaks down. Finally, the article speculates that AI‑driven specification languages might reshape how developers manage complexity in the future.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters largely agreed that incremental evolution beats big‑up‑front design, but they debated the universality of Gall’s Law, noting that it fits software more than mechanical engineering where complex machines can be engineered from detailed plans. A recurring theme was the tension between planners who favor extensive specifications and practitioners who champion rapid prototyping and iterative refinement, with several users sharing personal experiences of failed “big‑design” projects. The conversation also explored how AI could enable a shift toward high‑density specification files that are easier to version and discuss, though skeptics warned that specifications alone cannot capture unknown‑unknowns. Overall, the thread highlighted a split between those who see planning as essential for cost control and those who view it as an illusion of omniscience, emphasizing the need for balanced, adaptive processes in complex system development.
