## [We tasked Opus 4.6 using agent teams to build a C Compiler](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler)
**Score:** 535 | **Comments:** 504 | **ID:** 46903616

> **Article:** Anthropic’s engineering team used Opus 4.6, orchestrated by autonomous agent teams, to generate a 100,000‑line C compiler written in pure Rust that can compile the Linux 6.9 kernel for x86, ARM and RISC‑V. The effort required roughly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and cost about $20 000 in API usage. While the compiler successfully builds large projects such as QEMU, FFmpeg and PostgreSQL, it lacks a native 16‑bit x86 code generator and falls back to GCC for that boot stage, and its generated code is less efficient than GCC even with all optimizations disabled. The article emphasizes that the implementation was a clean‑room effort with no internet access during development.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters praised the milestone as a striking proof that LLMs can produce functional system software, yet many highlighted the practical shortcomings: the compiler’s performance lags far behind decades‑old GCC, it cannot emit the required 16‑bit boot code without external help, and it still relies on GCC for linking and assembly. A heated debate emerged over the “clean‑room” claim, with some accusing the model of regurgitating existing compiler code while others argued that the LLM merely recombines learned patterns rather than copying verbatim. The $20 k price tag and the uncertainty of hidden bugs sparked concerns about commercial viability, though others pointed out that early AI projects often run at a loss before scaling. Overall, the thread balanced admiration for the technical achievement with skepticism about efficiency, originality, and the path toward truly autonomous, production‑grade compilers.
