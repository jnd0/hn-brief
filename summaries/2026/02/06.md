## [Flock CEO calls Deflock a “terrorist organization” (2025) [video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kZGrDz7PU)
**Score:** 580 | **Comments:** 400 | **ID:** 46903556

> **Article:** The short video features the CEO of Flock, a $658 million‑funded surveillance company, labeling the activist group Deflock as a “terrorist organization” whose primary motivation is chaos and likening it to Antifa. He argues that Flock operates within a democratic, capitalistic system where disputes can be settled in court, and claims the company is not forcing its cameras on anyone. The CEO contrasts Deflock’s tactics with the more “above‑board” approaches of groups like the ACLU and EFF, emphasizing that elected officials choose Flock for community safety. He concludes that while Deflock has the right to its views, its methods are regrettable and should be condemned.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly turned the interview into a broader critique of surveillance capitalism, noting that Flock’s massive VC backing enables aggressive law‑fare against smaller activist groups. Several users highlighted real‑world pushbacks, citing municipalities such as Mountain View and Staunton that disabled Flock installations after uncovering unauthorized data sharing and a “statewide lookup” feature used by hundreds of agencies. The thread devolved into a semantic battle over labels, with participants accusing the CEO of weaponizing the term “terrorist” while others warned that such language dilutes its historical meaning. Amid the polemics, a few contributors offered concrete technical insights, referencing FOIA requests, privacy‑law violations, and the feasibility of disabling cameras, underscoring the tension between civil‑rights advocacy and corporate surveillance agendas.

## [LinkedIn checks for 2953 browser extensions](https://github.com/mdp/linkedin-extension-fingerprinting)
**Score:** 354 | **Comments:** 177 | **ID:** 46904361

> **Article:** The GitHub project mdp/linkedin-extension-fingerprinting documents how LinkedIn probes a visitor’s browser for the presence of 2,953 Chrome extensions by requesting their web‑accessible resources via chrome‑extension://[extension‑ID]/… URLs. The technique leverages the stable extension IDs published in the Chrome Web Store, allowing LinkedIn to infer which automation or scraping tools a user has installed. The author notes that Firefox is largely immune because its extensions use randomly generated UUIDs that change per profile, preventing such fingerprinting. The repository includes the full list of detected extensions, many of which are marketed as LinkedIn scrapers, AI assistants, or lead‑generation tools.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly identified the list as dominated by scraping and sales‑automation extensions, confirming LinkedIn’s motive to block or track tools that harvest its data. A split emerged between those defending LinkedIn’s anti‑abuse stance and critics who saw the practice as invasive tracking by a major data broker, with several users calling it a security vulnerability that should be patched. Technical debate centered on Chrome’s static extension IDs versus Firefox’s per‑profile random UUIDs, with some noting that privacy‑focused extensions like uBlock Origin deliberately hide their resources to evade detection. Others questioned the legality of LinkedIn’s data collection method, suggesting it may violate Chrome Web Store terms, while a few offered mitigation ideas such as modifying extensions or using browsers that randomize IDs.
