## [How I use Claude Code: Separation of planning and execution](https://boristane.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code/)
**Score:** 609 | **Comments:** 377 | **ID:** 47106686

> **Article:** The article outlines a workflow for using Claude Code that strictly separates the planning and execution phases. The author claims that using explicit language like "deeply," "in great details," and "go through everything" is necessary to force the model to thoroughly read and analyze code instead of skimming surface-level signatures. A specific detail is the assertion that without such phrasing, Claude will only perform a superficial review of files, leading to incorrect implementations. This method aims to improve output quality by compelling deeper engagement with the existing codebase before generating changes.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the validity, mechanics, and productivity implications of the author's prompting technique. A key technical debate explores why phrases like "read deeply" might work, with explanations ranging from the model's attention mechanism being biased toward expert-level discourse in its training data to claims it's merely post-training reinforcement learning behavior or outright superstition lacking statistical proof. A major disagreement pits developers who find the planning-heavy workflow saves significant time on complex tasks against those who argue the overhead of writing detailed specs outweighs any benefit for experienced coders. Several commenters reframe the role as becoming a "software manager" for an unreliable intern, emphasizing that this approach enforces better practices like atomic commits and thorough documentation, even if it introduces new workflow complexities. The thread reveals a community split between skepticism of prompt engineering magic and endorsement of the structured, risk-averse methodology for managing LLM limitations.

## [What not to write on your security clearance form (1988)](https://milk.com/wall-o-shame/security_clearance.html)
**Score:** 456 | **Comments:** 199 | **ID:** 47102576

> **Article:** The 1988 guide warns applicants against writing anything that could be interpreted as a security risk, such as admitting to past drug use, foreign contacts, or even a childhood joke about being a Japanese spy. It stresses that lying on the SF‑86 form is a felony and that the government prefers applicants to pick the nearest “bin” rather than disclose ambiguous facts. The article cites a real‑world incident where a security officer tore up a form after the applicant answered truthfully about a prior FBI inquiry, illustrating how the system punishes honesty. It also notes that the form asks whether you have ever been a member of a communist party, a question many Eastern Europeans would have to answer affirmatively if they wanted to enter the U.S.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters split over whether the clearance process encourages deception, with boothby calling the advice to lie a felony and cs02rm0 noting that travel forms still ask about espionage involvement, prompting many allied intelligence officers to omit such history. TrackerFF and albedoa clashed over which vices attract the most scrutiny, with TrackerFF claiming weed use is punished more harshly than alcohol or debt, while albedoa argued financial indiscretions are the primary denial factor. Several threads invoked Goodhart’s Law and the “Seeing like a bank” analogy, suggesting that the form’s rigid categories force applicants into falsehoods and that a more flexible, asynchronous ticketing system could improve the experience. Personal anecdotes ranged from a 2002 denial after disclosing 40 joints and 10 ecstasy tablets to a clearance officer who forgave past “dumb shit” as long as the applicant demonstrated no intent to repeat it. Others criticized the broader security apparatus as a jobs program, pointing out that billions are spent on investigations that rarely prevent threats, while some defended the FBI’s wartime probe of a cryptographic key near a military installation as justified. The thread also drifted into light‑hearted domain‑ownership jokes, with users marveling at the novelty of owning milk.com and its lactoserv header.

## [Parse, Don't Validate and Type-Driven Design in Rust](https://www.harudagondi.space/blog/parse-dont-validate-and-type-driven-design-in-rust/)
**Score:** 197 | **Comments:** 49 | **ID:** 47103931

> **Article:** The article advocates for "Parse, Don't Validate," a type-driven design principle in Rust where programs should transform untrusted input into types that are correct by construction, rather than validating data after the fact. It demonstrates this with examples like wrapping a `f32` in a `NonZeroF32` newtype to prevent division by zero and creating a `NonEmptyVec<T>` type to guarantee a vector has at least one element. The core argument is that encoding invariants in the type system moves error checking to compile time, making illegal states unrepresentable and simplifying downstream logic.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the trade-offs and interpretations of the "Parse, Don't Validate" philosophy. A key tension emerges between the approach of creating many specialized types (as the article suggests) versus using fewer, more general types with many functions (a style common in languages like Clojure), with concerns about type incompatibility and code adaptability. Commenters debate the strength of different techniques, noting that simple newtypes provide encapsulation and clarity but are not true "correctness by construction" like dependent types, which can enforce invariants like array bounds at compile time even for runtime-determined lengths. The article's division-by-zero example is criticized for relying on encapsulation rather than pure type-level guarantees, while the non-empty vector example is praised as a better illustration. The conversation also explores Rust's potential future with pattern types as a lighter-weight alternative to full dependent typing, and acknowledges that parsing is always necessary for external, untrusted data.

## [Cloudflare outage on February 20, 2026](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-february-20-2026/)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 116 | **ID:** 47103649

> **Article:** Cloudflare's February 20, 2026, outage stemmed from a critical API design flaw where a GET request for BYOIP prefixes without a specific query parameter (`pending_delete`) incorrectly returned all prefixes instead of just those queued for deletion. This bug, combined with insufficient testing of the modified endpoint, caused a massive data deletion operation to execute unintentionally. The incident highlights systemic reliability challenges at Cloudflare, including recent network disruptions and leadership issues, as discussed in the linked blog post.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion centered on Cloudflare's reliability issues, with users debating whether recent outages reflect genuine systemic failures or recency bias. Technical analysis revealed a critical API design flaw: the `v1 prefixes` endpoint, modified to handle pending deletions, defaulted to returning all prefixes when the `pending_delete` parameter was absent (due to Go's query parameter handling), leading to the accidental deletion of all BYOIP prefixes. This design choice, overloading a non-destructive endpoint for a destructive operation, was widely criticized as dangerous. The outage also reignited debates about Cloudflare's leadership changes, AI-first strategy, and culture of rapid shipping over reliability, with some users alleging intentional code sabotage by engineers.
