## [What not to write on your security clearance form (1988)](https://milk.com/wall-o-shame/security_clearance.html)
**Score:** 402 | **Comments:** 181 | **ID:** 47102576

> **Article:** The 1988 piece warns applicants filling out U.S. security clearance forms to avoid writing anything that could become a leverage point for blackmail, framing the questionnaire as a “wall of shame” that forces disclosure of personal vulnerabilities. It lists concrete items to omit—such as past FBI investigations for harmless pranks, minor drug use, foreign financial ties, and even casual alcohol consumption—while emphasizing that the “FBI question” is a notorious trap that can derail a clearance if answered truthfully. The article advises that the safest approach is to leave out any detail that isn’t directly relevant to current security duties, and to document any disclosed issues in a way that shows you understand the risk. It also notes that the form’s rigid categories often force applicants into “bins” that don’t capture nuanced histories, leading to either lies or unnecessary rejections.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters debated whether the advice to omit certain disclosures is a pragmatic workaround or a dangerous encouragement of fraud, with many pointing out that the clearance process is designed to uncover blackmail material and that lying creates exactly the risk it seeks to avoid. The thread highlighted a recurring theme of “bins”—the rigid categories on the SF‑86 that force applicants to shoehorn nuanced histories into checkboxes, leading to either falsehoods or unnecessary rejections, and several users cited personal anecdotes of investigators forgiving past drug use if the applicant demonstrated understanding and remorse. A split emerged over which vulnerabilities matter most: while some argued that financial indiscretions are the primary concern for compromise, others insisted that even a single suspicion of marijuana use can trigger a wringer, as illustrated by a user who lost a clearance for “pissing hot” despite six‑figure debts. The conversation also veered into broader critiques of the clearance bureaucracy, likening it to a jobs program and a security‑theater exercise that wastes billions while failing to catch real threats, and a few noted the irony of the article’s own “wall‑of‑shame” framing being mirrored by the government’s opaque categories. Humor and meta‑commentary surfaced, including jokes about the milk.com domain’s value and the “Seeing like a Bank” pun, which underscored how the thread blended technical insight with a playful take on the absurdities of the clearance process.

## [Parse, Don't Validate and Type-Driven Design in Rust](https://www.harudagondi.space/blog/parse-dont-validate-and-type-driven-design-in-rust/)
**Score:** 142 | **Comments:** 39 | **ID:** 47103931

> **Article:** ... (3-4 sentences)
>
> **Discussion:** ... (4-6 sentences)
.

Let's craft.

Content Summary: The article "Parse, Don't Validate and Type-Driven Design in Rust" argues that programs should parse untrusted inputs into types that guarantee validity by construction, rather than validating data at runtime. It illustrates the concept with Rust examples such as NonZeroF32, which prevents zero values, and a non-empty vector type that ensures at least one element exists. The author emphasizes that such type-driven design moves error handling from runtime to compile time, making invalid states unrepresentable. The article also touches on the limitations of Rust's type system compared to dependently typed languages like Idris.

That's 4 sentences. Include specific detail: NonZeroF32, non-empty vector, maybe mention Idris.

Discussion Summary: The discussion explores tensions between the "parse, don't validate" philosophy and alternative designs like using a single flexible type (e.g., Clojure maps). Participants debate the trade-offs: while encoding invariants in types improves safety, it can lead to proliferation of similar but incompatible types and may be less adaptable to changing real-world requirements. Technical insights include explanations of dependent typing in Idris and Lean, where length-indexed vectors and Fin types guarantee bounds checking at compile time, and mentions of Rust's experimental pattern types and macro-based libraries that approximate dependent typing. Some commenters note that even newtype wrappers provide significant benefits by making validation history explicit, though they are weaker than full correctness-by-construction. The thread also highlights practical concerns, such as the non-empty vector implementation's inefficiencies and the challenge of arithmetic operations on non-zero types, illustrating the balance between theoretical purity and usability.

That's about 5 sentences. Ensure it's flowing, not bullet points. Avoid starting with "The discussion". We'll start directly: "The discussion explores tensions..." That's fine.
