## [Show HN: SQL-tap – Real-time SQL traffic viewer for PostgreSQL and MySQL](https://github.com/mickamy/sql-tap)
**Score:** 217 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 47011567

> **Project:** SQL-tap is a real-time SQL traffic viewer for PostgreSQL and MySQL that operates as a transparent proxy, intercepting and displaying database queries as they flow between applications and the database. The project aims to provide developers with immediate visibility into SQL activity without requiring changes to database configurations, making it particularly useful for debugging and development environments. The creator emphasizes that while latency concerns are commonly raised, the actual technical challenge lies in correctly implementing the complex PostgreSQL and MySQL wire protocols, not in the minimal microseconds of added delay.
>
> **Discussion:** The community debate centers on whether a proxy-based approach like SQL-tap is preferable to passive methods like packet capture, eBPF, or native database logging. Many users argue that TLS encryption renders packet capture useless, while eBPF, though powerful, introduces kernel-space complexity and context-switching overhead that makes extensions a more efficient alternative—though they’re incompatible with managed services like RDS. A key insight emerges: proxies aren’t just for observation; they enable active policy enforcement, credential rotation, and tenant isolation—capabilities impossible with passive monitoring. Critics rightly point out that proxies add network hops and operational complexity, especially when not co-located, and that enabling query logging or using tools like pg_stat_statements is simpler and more reliable in production. Yet defenders counter that for development, debugging, or legacy systems where logging can’t be enabled, a lightweight proxy offers unmatched convenience and real-time interactivity. The UI and usability of SQL-tap drew praise for exposing WordPress’s query bloat, with users requesting features like query sorting, filtering, and execution frequency tracking—highlighting a broader appetite for developer-centric, interactive SQL observability tools.
