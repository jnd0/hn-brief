## [My smart sleep mask broadcasts users' brainwaves to an open MQTT broker](https://aimilios.bearblog.dev/reverse-engineering-sleep-mask/)
**Score:** 475 | **Comments:** 214 | **ID:** 47015294

> **Article:** The article details a reverse‑engineered smart sleep mask that claims to monitor EEG, deliver electrical stimulation around the eyes, vibration, heating and audio, then streams the raw brainwave data over Bluetooth to a phone which forwards it to an openly accessible MQTT broker (e.g., mqtt.eclipse.org). The author shows MQTT topics such as “sleepmask/EEG” and payloads containing 256‑Hz samples, timestamps and device IDs, noting that the broker requires no authentication and exposes users’ sleep data to anyone on the internet. The post also cites the mask’s advertised 20‑hour battery life and links the hardware to the Kickstarter project “Dreampilot AI,” warning that the lack of encryption and public data transmission constitute a serious privacy risk.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between those who see the mask as a plausible, if ambitious, Kickstarter gadget and those who view it as a speculative fiction stunt. Skeptics such as flax and llm_nerd highlighted the thinness of the prototype, the dubious battery claim, and the absence of concrete hardware or protocol documentation, questioning whether a single wearable could comfortably combine EEG sensing, eye‑muscle stimulation, heating, audio and a 20‑hour runtime. Others, including petercooper and llm_nerd, demonstrated that LLMs can hunt Bluetooth peripherals when paired with MCP‑style agents, and saw the mask as a realistic shortcut that leverages cheap firmware and open MQTT for rapid prototyping. The thread also turned into a privacy debate, with SubiculumCode and willturman warning that broadcasting raw EEG to an open MQTT broker leaves users exposed, while speedgoose emphasized the broader IoT security problem of open brokers being used for DDoS relays. Finally, several participants framed the device as a sci‑fi seed for shared dreaming or Inception‑style neural manipulation, while a few, like girvo and devmor, cautioned that LLM‑generated code can be brittle and that the quality of the reverse‑engineered protocol remains uncertain.

## [Platforms bend over backward to help DHS censor ICE critics, advocates say](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/platforms-bend-over-backward-to-help-dhs-censor-ice-critics-advocates-say/)
**Score:** 276 | **Comments:** 167 | **ID:** 47015406

> **Article:** The article investigates claims that major tech platforms have actively assisted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in censoring criticism of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including by removing content and providing user data upon request. Advocates highlight Apple's Advanced Data Protection feature as a specific vulnerability, arguing it could be compromised by government backdoors despite promises of encryption. The piece details how platforms allegedly exceeded legal obligations by proactively suppressing dissent, citing instances where ICE critics faced deplatforming without clear judicial oversight. This cooperation raises alarms about the erosion of free speech and the normalization of state surveillance through corporate partnerships.
>
> **Discussion:** The thread erupts with accusations of political hypocrisy, as users note Republicans' anti-censorship rhetoric clashes with their support for suppressing ICE criticism, while Democrats face similar scrutiny over vaccine mandates and cancel culture. A central debate pits corporate vulnerability against ethical responsibility, with some arguing publicly traded firms cannot defy sovereign governments without risking stock price and retaliation, while others demand they appeal to public conscience to resist unethical demands like ICE contracts. Technical solutions for anonymity surface, including decentralized platforms used in Hong Kong protests and USENET, though participants acknowledge hurdles like app store restrictions and the need for clever cryptography to anonymize centralized services. The conversation darkens as comparisons to authoritarian regimes intensify, with references to far-right ideologies and Chinese-style censorship, and users express alarm that U.S. tech giants are enabling state overreach that could undermine their own dominance and user trust. Historical parallels emerge, such as France's CapGemini subsidiary being forced to divest from ICE after public backlash, highlighting how corporate alignment with government can backfire. Amid the anger, some question whether decentralized alternatives are practical, noting the challenges of scaling peer-to-peer networks across vast rural areas and the persistent threat of government pressure on any platform.

## [Show HN: Sameshi – a ~1200 Elo chess engine that fits within 2KB](https://github.com/datavorous/sameshi)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 69 | **ID:** 47014500

> **Project:** Sameshi is a self‑hosted chess engine that fits in roughly two kilobytes of source code and claims a ~1200 Elo rating on Chess.com bullet games. It runs a mailbox board representation, a material‑only evaluation, and a shallow alpha‑beta search while deliberately disabling castling, en‑passant, and promotion by filtering Stockfish’s legal moves. The author later released a readable version of the code and notes that the rating applies only to the restricted rule set, not to full modern chess. The project demonstrates how aggressive minification can shrink a functional engine to a size comparable to a QR code.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between awe at the sheer size of the engine and skepticism about its claim to be a full chess engine, with several noting that the reported ~1200 Elo rating applies only to a variant stripped of castling, en‑passant, and promotion, a point the author confirmed by filtering Stockfish’s legal moves and arguing that such a constrained game makes the rating less meaningful. Technical threads explored the use of a mailbox board representation versus bitboards, the material‑only evaluation squeezed into the tiny code, and the impact of simple move‑ordering tricks on search depth, with one user pointing out that a captures‑first sort can roughly double effective depth. Comparisons to other ultra‑compact engines—ToledoChess’s 2KB JavaScript version, asmFish’s 130 KiB x86 port, and the 4
