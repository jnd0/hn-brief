## [Show HN: Sameshi – a ~1200 Elo chess engine that fits within 2KB](https://github.com/datavorous/sameshi)
**Score:** 147 | **Comments:** 40 | **ID:** 47014500

> **Project:** Sameshi is a 2 KB chess engine that achieves roughly 1,200 Elo on Chess.com bullet, using a mailbox board representation and a material‑only evaluation function. The author deliberately filtered Stockfish’s legal moves to exclude castling, en‑passant, and promotions, so the rating reflects a constrained variant rather than full‑rule chess. The source is heavily minified, with single‑letter variable names and no comments, making it difficult to read but easy to fit in the size limit. The project demonstrates that a tiny engine can still play at a respectable level by relying on simple search and pruning techniques.
>
> **Discussion:** The thread quickly split between admiration for the size‑only achievement and skepticism about the rating’s relevance, with many noting that the engine’s 1,200 Elo is measured only after disabling castling, en‑passant, and promotions, a limitation that some called “cheating” while others defended it as a fair test of pure search. Technical comments highlighted the trade‑offs of using a mailbox board over bitboards, explaining that the former saves bytes at the cost of slower move generation, and pointed out that the evaluation function is limited to material because piece‑square tables would exceed the 2 KB budget. Several users speculated about the potential Elo gain if the engine were allowed another 2 KB, with references to the TCEC 4 KB category where engines reach around 3,000 Elo, and a few suggested that even a simple captures‑first move ordering could roughly double effective search depth. The conversation also turned into a code‑golf challenge, with requests for a readable version and jokes about reverse‑engineering the minified source, while some praised the author’s willingness to share the minified code as a “spirit of FOSS”. Finally, a couple of participants raised the broader philosophical question of how many bytes would be needed to encode a human mind, echoing a Westworld‑style analogy, and a few mentioned tools like cutechess for more accurate Elo estimation.
