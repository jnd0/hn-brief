## [MinIO repository is no longer maintained](https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/7aac2a2c5b7c882e68c1ce017d8256be2feea27f)
**Score:** 442 | **Comments:** 319 | **ID:** 47000041

> **Article:** The Hacker News post links to a MinIO commit that announces the project will no longer maintain its open‑source repository, effectively ending the free community edition and redirecting resources toward a paid product. The commit cites the difficulty of sustaining a large‑scale open‑source effort without revenue, noting that the team’s chronic back pain was alleviated once they stopped unpaid maintenance. The announcement also references the company’s shift to a commercial‑open‑source model, where basic features remain free but advanced capabilities are locked behind a subscription. The move has sparked a wave of community reaction, with users weighing the trade‑off between convenience and long‑term reliability.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters split between those who view MinIO’s pivot as a pragmatic business move and those who see it as a betrayal of the open‑source community, with jbstack accusing the project of a bait‑and‑switch after luring users with a free FOSS promise. Others, such as StopDisinfo910, argue that contributors have no moral obligation to continue unpaid work, while jillesvangurp offers a practical checklist for assessing risk, emphasizing contributor diversity, license flexibility, and the resilience of foundations over single‑company backing. Technical evaluations surface a range of alternatives: victormy praises RustFS for speed and user‑friendly console, gunapologist99 highlights Garage’s simple single‑binary setup, and PunchyHamster warns that RustFS’s contributor‑license agreement feels like a repeat of MinIO’s rug‑pull. Milvus maintainer redskyluan echoes the broader industry tension, noting that free users subsidize paid customers and that AI‑driven workloads amplify the need for truly open storage, while jamiemallers points out the recurring pattern of open‑source adoption followed by a closed‑source pivot that forces costly migrations. Finally, apexalpha calls for a new license that forces large‑revenue companies to pay, and mananaysiempre reminds the community that Redis’s own licensing history shows how fragile promises can be when a single vendor controls the project.

## [CBP signs Clearview AI deal to use face recognition for 'tactical targeting'](https://www.wired.com/story/cbp-signs-clearview-ai-deal-to-use-face-recognition-for-tactical-targeting/)
**Score:** 246 | **Comments:** 140 | **ID:** 47005081

> **Article:** The article discusses how Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has signed a deal with Clearview AI to use facial recognition technology for "tactical targeting" purposes. This partnership raises concerns about government agencies potentially circumventing legal restrictions by outsourcing surveillance capabilities to private companies. Clearview AI's technology allows for identifying individuals by matching their faces against a vast database of images scraped from the internet without users' consent.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News thread centers on concerns about government outsourcing surveillance to private companies to bypass legal restrictions. Commenters debate whether the distinction between government and private surveillance is meaningful when private companies effectively act as government contractors. Some argue that governments should face higher standards since they can directly deprive people of liberties, while others see this separation as artificial. The discussion also explores technical aspects of facial recognition, including its evolution from earlier methods to modern AI systems, and practical countermeasures like wearing face masks. There's also debate about the ethical responsibility of software engineers working for companies like Clearview AI and whether constitutional amendments guaranteeing anonymity would be beneficial or problematic.

## [OpenAI has deleted the word 'safely' from its mission](https://theconversation.com/openai-has-deleted-the-word-safely-from-its-mission-and-its-new-structure-is-a-test-for-whether-ai-serves-society-or-shareholders-274467)
**Score:** 227 | **Comments:** 97 | **ID:** 47008560

> **Article:** OpenAI quietly removed the word “safely” from its mission statement, a change documented in its IRS 990 filings and highlighted in the article as part of a broader shift from a nonprofit‑driven safety ethos to a for‑profit structure. The piece notes that the April 15 2025 Preparedness Framework update dropped the “persuasion‑manipulation” risk category, moving those concerns to terms‑of‑service restrictions rather than pre‑release testing. By framing the change as a test of whether AI will serve society or shareholders, the author argues that the new corporate focus may prioritize profit over public safety. The article cites the mission‑statement evolution—from “benefits humanity” in 2021 to “safely benefits humanity” in 2022 and back to a stripped‑down version in 2025—as concrete evidence of the strategic pivot.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters on Hacker News seized on the mission‑statement edit as a symptom of a deeper tension between profit motives and safety guarantees, with many arguing that “safely” was a legal liability shield that OpenAI could no longer afford once it became a public company. Some framed the Preparedness Framework’s removal of the persuasion‑manipulation category as a deliberate shift of responsibility to users, while others warned that such a move could enable election‑swinging propaganda and called for stricter pre‑release audits. The thread split over whether AI will become a commodity with thin moats—hardware fabs and silicon fabs—versus a strategic arms race driven by investor hype, with participants like amelius and overgard debating the economic logic of an “arms race to nothing” if LLMs never achieve AGI. A parallel conversation about the ethics of using archive.is highlighted the community’s ambivalence toward “purity tests,” with observationist defending the site as a necessary workaround for paywalls despite its black‑hat tactics. Legal liability surfaced repeatedly, with users suggesting that corporate leaders could face criminal charges for negligent harm, and others noting that dropping “safely” may simply be a hedge against investor lawsuits. Finally, the absence of a safety team in xAI’s hiring deck and Anthropic’s public‑benefit‑corporation status sparked curiosity about how other labs balance mission language with profit imperatives, underscoring a broader uncertainty about the future governance of advanced AI.

> **Article:** The article discusses the European Commission's proposed measures to address addictive design in digital platforms, particularly focusing on infinite scrolling and cookie popups. Critics argue these actions are more about political leverage than genuine public health concerns, while supporters emphasize the need to curb harmful behaviors linked to excessive usage. The conversation highlights concerns over overregulation, the potential for unintended consequences on small businesses, and the distinction between protecting users and stifling innovation. Participants stress the importance of balancing consumer rights with the realities of global tech markets. Technical insights reveal that the EU is not targeting individual users but rather specific corporations, using negotiation rather than strict enforcement. Community reactions range from skepticism about motives to calls for simpler, more transparent solutions.
>
> **Discussion:** Debaters centered on whether the EU’s moves are genuine efforts to protect users or strategic political moves against powerful companies. Many questioned the feasibility of banning features like infinite scrolling and criticized the lack of clear, enforceable rules. Others argued that the focus on corporate accountability could undermine innovation and disproportionately affect smaller platforms. There was agreement on the need for transparency, with some suggesting alternatives like stricter data policies rather than design restrictions. Overall, the conversation reflected a tension between public health concerns and the complexities of regulating modern digital ecosystems.

## [Open source is not about you (2018)](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 157 | **ID:** 47003219

> **Article:** The article argues that open source maintainers have no obligation to users beyond making code publicly available, rejecting the notion that publishing software implies a duty to provide documentation, respond to bugs, or review pull requests. The author, Rich Hickey, frames open source as a personal, non-committal act—comparing it to putting a note on a bulletin board—and asserts that users who expect support are misunderstanding the nature of free software. This perspective is grounded in the idea that maintaining software is voluntary labor, and users who demand time or attention from maintainers are imposing an unfair burden.
>
> **Discussion:** The community is sharply divided between those who believe open source implies a social contract of basic courtesy and those who see it as a purely voluntary, no-strings-attached act. Many contributors argue that ignoring bug reports, leaving PRs unreviewed, or offering no documentation is not just inconsiderate—it actively drives away potential contributors and erodes the health of the open source ecosystem, citing personal experiences of wasted effort and emotional exhaustion. Others counter that expecting maintenance, documentation, or responsiveness is entitlement masquerading as courtesy, emphasizing that public code is not a promise but a gift, and users who can’t navigate undocumented projects should seek alternatives. A key technical insight emerges around project governance: several commenters suggest that maintainers can and should signal their intentions via clear CONTRIBUTING files or by disabling features like issues and PRs to manage expectations, rather than leaving users guessing. Underlying the debate is a tension between individual autonomy and collective responsibility, with some warning that the culture of unpaid labor in open source is unsustainable unless maintainers are empowered to set boundaries, while others fear that normalizing indifference will kill the collaborative spirit that made open source valuable in the first place.

## [US repeals EPA endangerment finding for greenhouse gases](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/12/climate/trump-repeals-epa-endangerment-finding)
**Score:** 153 | **Comments:** 92 | **ID:** 47001865

> **Article:** The Trump administration has repealed the EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, removing the agency's authority to regulate emissions from vehicles and other sources. This action eliminates key regulatory tools for addressing climate change and air pollution, potentially allowing for cheaper but more polluting vehicles to be sold in the US market. The repeal represents a significant shift in environmental policy, prioritizing economic considerations over emissions controls.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals deep divisions over climate policy and its global implications. Some commenters argue that repealing emissions regulations will make the US vulnerable to international pressure as other nations clean up their air and potentially impose trade restrictions. Others contend that most countries prioritize cheap electricity over emissions reductions, with only Western nations taking aggressive climate action. Technical debates emerged about CO2's health impacts, with some claiming elevated concentrations pose direct physiological threats while others countered that current atmospheric levels are not immediately harmful to human health. The conversation also touched on broader political dynamics, with some viewing Republican climate policy as deliberately undermining government functionality, while others criticized Democratic border policies. Several commenters expressed frustration with the politicization of climate science and the tendency to flag politically charged discussions on HN. The repeal's implications for international relations, domestic air quality, and the balance between economic and environmental priorities remained central points of contention throughout the discussion.

## [IronClaw: a Rust-based clawd that runs tools in isolated WASM sandboxes](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw)
**Score:** 137 | **Comments:** 65 | **ID:** 47004312

> **Article:** IronClaw is a Rust-based implementation of the clawd protocol that runs tools in isolated WASM sandboxes. The project aims to provide a more secure environment for AI agents by isolating tool execution from the main agent process. It requires a Near AI account and claims to offer verifiable inference on TEEs for open source models, while proxying Anthropic models through trusted TEEs.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion reveals significant skepticism about the security model and practical benefits of IronClaw. Many commenters argue that traditional VM isolation is sufficient and that the real challenge lies in controlling agent actions before they occur, not sandboxing them after the fact. Some developers shared alternative approaches, like using Docker containers with restricted access or implementing key brokers that prevent agents from directly accessing credentials. There's also debate about whether WASM is the right technology choice, with some suggesting OCI containers might be more appropriate. The conversation highlights broader concerns about AI agent security, with participants questioning whether sandboxing can truly prevent malicious actions when agents have access to sensitive credentials and APIs. Several commenters expressed frustration with what they perceive as poorly defined security architectures that lack clear threat models or explanations of what threats they actually mitigate.
