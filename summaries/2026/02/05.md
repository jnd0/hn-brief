## [I miss thinking hard](https://www.jernesto.com/articles/thinking_hard)
**Score:** 1196 | **Comments:** 659 | **ID:** 46881264

> **Article:** The article reflects on a March 2025 Mastodon post by Aral Balkan, which likens coding to shaping a lump of clay and argues that the iterative process of creation is essential for truly understanding a problem. Balkan claims that modern “agentic” tools often deliver a finished artifact that bypasses the learning that comes from hands‑on experimentation, turning developers into consumers of pre‑shaped solutions. He warns that skipping the messy, exploratory phase trades deep insight for a superficial simulacrum of the intended product. The piece concludes that the rise of AI‑driven code generation threatens the authentic practice of discovery in software development.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters split between nostalgia for the “hard thinking” of manual coding and enthusiasm for AI‑augmented productivity. Users like topspin, paladin314159, and gkoberger argue that generative tools free them to focus on architecture, design trade‑offs, and higher‑level problem solving, effectively increasing the intensity of their thought. In contrast, voices such as socalgal2, keyle, and helloplanets caution that reliance on LLMs erodes the learning curve, can produce janky results, and forces developers to constantly battle the model’s default, average solutions. A recurring theme is the tension between abstraction—accepting libraries, OSes, and engines as given—and the desire to understand underlying mechanisms, with Krssst noting that unlike deterministic APIs, AI models lack stable specifications. The thread also touches on practical benefits, as monch1962 describes using AI to prototype ideas in short bursts, while skeptics like zackmorris warn that the shift may diminish the craft of programming altogether. Overall, the community debates whether AI is a liberating step toward deeper cognition or a shortcut that undermines the foundational skill of thinking hard.

## [The Great Unwind](https://occupywallst.com/yen)
**Score:** 220 | **Comments:** 165 | **ID:** 46889008

> **Article:** The article “The Great Unwind” examines the current reversal of the yen carry‑trade, noting that Japanese investors are rapidly selling U.S. Treasury holdings as the Bank of Japan maintains a zero‑interest‑rate policy. It claims that this liquidation is pressuring global bond markets and could trigger broader volatility, especially in assets like gold and silver that have recently seen sharp price swings. The piece also links the yen unwind to broader geopolitical moves, such as China’s push to promote the yuan as a reserve currency, and warns that the strategy may expose hidden debt risks in the United States.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly turned the thread into a debate over the stewardship of occupywallst.com, with users like knuckleheads accusing jart (Justine Tunney) of hijacking the site’s original activist purpose, while jart defended her role as a neutral platform provider. The conversation then shifted to the macro‑economic claims of the article: sharifhsn and others dissected the yen carry‑trade unwind, agreeing that Japan’s ZIRP fuels the phenomenon but rejecting the notion that it alone explains recent market turbulence, and they highlighted the need for expert sources beyond the article’s LLM‑generated narrative. Opinions diverged on China’s ambitions, with UltraSane dismissing the yuan as a viable reserve currency while others speculated about a future gold‑backed alternative. Side discussions emerged about unrelated market moves, such as Microsoft’s stock pressures from AI investments and a notable 40 % drop in silver prices, illustrating the thread’s broad but interconnected focus on financial speculation and activist credibility.

## [How Jeff Bezos Brought Down the Washington Post](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/how-jeff-bezos-brought-down-the-washington-post)
**Score:** 201 | **Comments:** 208 | **ID:** 46890034

> **Article:** The New Yorker article argues that Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post has paradoxically accelerated its decline despite early digital gains. After a brief profit surge tied to the 2016 election, the paper posted losses of $100 million in 2024 and underwent two voluntary buyouts—in 2023 and 2025—that cut newsroom staff from more than 1,000 to under 800. The piece contends that Bezos’s push for rapid digital expansion, combined with editorial shifts that alienated long‑time readers, left the Post vulnerable to subscriber churn and a shrinking local news footprint. Ultimately, the author suggests that Bezos’s focus on prestige and influence, rather than sustainable journalism, has “brought down” the historic newspaper.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly contrasted the Post’s fate with the New York Times, noting that the Times has turned games and cooking newsletters into profitable subscription hooks while the Post failed to replicate such verticals. A recurring theme was the tension between financial losses—several hundred‑million‑dollar deficits cited for 2023‑2025—and Bezos’s seemingly limitless personal wealth, prompting debate over whether profit motives or political calculations drove the layoffs. Users also blamed the Post’s editorial drift, accusing it of abandoning local coverage and shifting its political tone, which they linked to subscriber cancellations. Some participants defended Bezos’s acquisition as a prestige move rather than a profit venture, while others argued that billionaire ownership inevitably reshapes newsroom independence, echoing broader concerns about media consolidation and the impact of tech platforms on journalism.

## [French streamer unbanked by Qonto after criticizing Palantir and Peter Thiel](https://twitter.com/Ced_haurus/status/2018716889191498172)
**Score:** 193 | **Comments:** 64 | **ID:** 46888438

> **Article:** A French livestreamer posted that Qonto, a French neobank backed by Peter Thiel, abruptly deactivated his card, closed his account, and blocked his funds shortly after he criticized Palantir. The streamer claims the action was retaliation for his remarks and emphasizes that he “doesn’t believe in coincidences.” Qonto’s public policy states it can close business accounts for prohibited activities, and the streamer’s account was a business‑type account. The tweet that sparked the discussion links to a translated version of the streamer’s accusation.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly split between those who see the timing as suspicious and those who attribute the closure to routine compliance or a breach of Qonto’s terms of service. Several users pointed out that Qonto regularly terminates business accounts for policy violations, noting the bank’s list of prohibited activities as a more plausible cause than a personal vendetta by Thiel. Others invoked broader concerns about “de‑banking” in Europe, citing examples like Wise’s arbitrary bans and Thiel’s past retaliation against Gawker, while emphasizing the lack of concrete evidence linking the streamer’s criticism to the account closure. A minority dismissed the claim as a post‑hoc fallacy, arguing the streamer’s small audience makes him an unlikely target for a high‑profile retaliation. Overall, the thread highlighted tension between fears of elite‑driven financial censorship and the reality of banks’ discretionary power to enforce their service agreements.

## [Attention at Constant Cost per Token via Symmetry-Aware Taylor Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00294)
**Score:** 143 | **Comments:** 77 | **ID:** 46886265

> **Article:** The paper proposes a “symmetry‑aware” Taylor expansion of the softmax in self‑attention, claiming that attention can be computed with constant cost per token regardless of sequence length. By truncating the series at the fourth order, the authors report element‑wise errors comparable to Float16 precision and suggest the method reproduces true attention without the usual quadratic overhead. The approach leverages incremental computation of higher‑order terms to keep the per‑token state size fixed, aiming to replace the standard QK V formulation with a polynomial‑time alternative. Experimental sections claim near‑identical performance to conventional transformers on benchmark tasks while achieving linear scaling.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly invoked prior lower‑bound results, arguing that any exact attention that lets every token see every other token must remain O(n²) and that sub‑quadratic schemes inevitably sacrifice information. Several users questioned the practicality of the Taylor approximation, noting concerns about convergence, the adequacy of element‑wise error as a metric, and whether four terms truly capture the sharp “needle‑in‑haystack” behavior of softmax. Others pointed out that similar tricks (e.g., computing KV first) already yield linear‑time components, but emphasized that the quadratic matrix multiplication step is unchanged in the paper. Skepticism was balanced by curiosity: some participants highlighted the claim of Float16‑level accuracy and asked for downstream benchmarks, while a few defended the idea that constant‑per‑token cost could be viable if the approximation error is negligible in practice. Overall, the thread mixed technical critique of the theoretical limits with cautious optimism about empirical results, and called for more rigorous evaluations on real models.

## [Claude Code for Infrastructure](https://www.fluid.sh/)
**Score:** 117 | **Comments:** 99 | **ID:** 46889703

> **Article:** Collin introduced fluid.sh, a “Claude Code for Infrastructure” tool that creates sandbox clones of production environments—VMs, Kubernetes clusters, etc.—so AI agents can safely run commands, test changes, and generate infrastructure-as-code such as Ansible playbooks. The system uses ephemeral SSH certificates and requires human approval before creating sandboxes on low‑resource hosts or installing packages, aiming to prevent accidental modifications to live systems. Fluid.sh is positioned as a safety layer that lets large‑scale infrastructures be managed by LLMs without granting them direct production access.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters quickly questioned whether the project solves a real need, with several users lamenting the abundance of “build‑something” tools that lack clear end‑user value. Safety concerns dominated the thread, as many expressed distrust of letting LLMs touch production and praised the sandbox approach as a necessary guardrail, while others argued that existing sandboxing methods already exist and the differentiator was unclear. The lack of detailed documentation and a vague homepage drew criticism, prompting suggestions to improve onboarding and explain destructive actions. Technical debates surfaced around teaching domain experts to code versus teaching developers the domain, and whether a “sandpit” environment is feasible at scale. Despite the skepticism, a few participants shared positive experiences using Claude Code for debugging, noting that fluid.sh’s automatic Ansible generation could streamline ops workflows.

**Score:** 99 | **Comments:** 63 | **ID:** 46888824

> **Article:** The Newsweek article reports that Steve Bannon has suggested the federal government could use Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to monitor and potentially intervene in U.S. elections. It cites a claim that ICE will expand to over 40,000 agents, a figure Bannon allegedly plans to leverage for “ensuring voting integrity.” The proposal includes deploying ICE personnel to traditionally Democratic precincts and using tools such as facial‑recognition software to identify likely GOP voters. Critics in the piece warn that such actions could amount to voter intimidation and a breach of democratic norms.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters immediately flagged the proposal as illegal voter intimidation, while another user invoked a Supreme Court precedent to argue that presidential actions aimed at election integrity are insulated from legal challenge. A heated debate emerged over whether the sheer number of ICE agents could realistically affect outcomes, with some pointing out the concentration of decisive votes in swing states and others dismissing the threat as logistical nonsense. The thread also veered into constitutional gun‑rights arguments, with participants questioning if armed voters could counter ICE presence at polls. Meta‑discussion about HN’s scope surfaced, as users argued whether the story constituted a credible threat or an off‑topic proposal, and several contributors framed the whole episode as part of a broader civil‑war‑like political crisis.

## [Microsoft's Copilot chatbot is running into problems](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-pivotal-ai-product-is-running-into-big-problems-ce235b28)
**Score:** 82 | **Comments:** 104 | **ID:** 46887564

> **Article:** Microsoft’s AI‑driven Copilot suite, billed as the company’s “pivotal” product, is facing serious setbacks, including low paid‑user conversion rates and widespread reports of hallucinations and poor integration. The Wall Street Journal article notes that only about 3.3 % of trial users convert to paying customers and that usage among existing subscribers fell from 18.8 % to 11.5 % since July. Internally, three separate Microsoft groups are developing products under the Copilot name without coordination, leading to inconsistent experiences such as the failed attempt by Nadella to use the Edge‑based Copilot for a live webpage. Analysts argue that the high operational and capital costs of running large language models are outpacing the revenue generated, putting the initiative’s viability in doubt.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters largely echo the article’s concerns, criticizing Microsoft’s “AI‑first” strategy as being driven more by headline numbers than genuine user value. Many point to the fragmented internal structure—three Copilot teams operating in silos—and cite the infamous Nadella email incident as evidence of poor product readiness. Others contrast Microsoft’s approach with competitors, noting that users are gravitating toward ChatGPT and Gemini, which enjoy higher adoption despite similar challenges. A recurring theme is the mismatch between Microsoft’s enterprise‑focused revenue model and the end‑user experience, with some arguing that the company’s push for integration feels like checkbox ticking rather than thoughtful design. While a few defenders highlight occasional technical strengths, the consensus paints Copilot as a costly, under‑delivered feature that threatens to erode confidence in Microsoft’s AI ambitions.
