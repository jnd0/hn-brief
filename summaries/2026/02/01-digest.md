Mobile carriers can pinpoint your phone’s GPS location at any time, not because of some rogue exploit, but because the protocols themselves—UMTS and LTE—were designed to let networks request that data directly from the device. This isn’t a bug; it’s baked into the baseband processor, operating below the OS, below your apps, below even the illusion of control. The justification? Emergency services. E911 compliance. Noble intent, sure—but the mechanism is blind to intent. It runs in the background, invisible, untouchable by user settings, and entirely outside the app permission model we’ve been taught to trust. The real kicker? That baseband processor, mandated by regulation, has access to your mic, your radio, your GPS—potentially even when the phone appears powered off. And while some argue warrants or carrier oversight prevent abuse, the architecture assumes compliance, not resistance. There’s no kill switch, no opt-out, no transparency. Just a backdoor dressed as public safety.

This dovetails with the growing unease around platform trust—Apple’s latest Platform Security PDF touts memory-safety improvements in iBoot and ADP for iCloud, but let’s be honest: unless you’ve manually enabled Advanced Data Protection, your backups are still decryptable by Apple. The defaults matter. So does opacity. You can praise Apple’s hardware-backed security all day, but without open firmware, you’re trusting a black box engineered by a company that still answers to investors, not cryptographers. And don’t get me started on WhatsApp: U.S. investigators are now probing whether its end-to-end encryption is as airtight as claimed. Sure, the Signal Protocol is sound, but when the client is closed-source, how do you know there’s no side-channel exfiltration? No seeded RNG? No silent metadata bleed? The crypto is only as strong as the machine it runs on—and that machine isn’t yours.

Which brings us to zero trust. Netbird’s emergence as a self-hostable alternative to Tailscale reflects a quiet rebellion: people don’t want to outsource their network control plane to another SaaS vendor, no matter how slick the UI. Headscale gets nods, but its SQLite backend and full-state sync don’t scale. Nebula, Octelium, Pangolin—there’s a whole ecosystem of people trying to rebuild secure networking without surrendering to convenience. Because once you’ve seen how easily a Funnel endpoint can be scraped via certificate transparency logs, you start questioning every “just works” feature. The same skepticism applies to cloud providers. One founder’s GCP account nuked overnight—six months of quota approvals undone by an automated system that offered no human appeal—should be a wake-up call. AWS, Azure, Cloudflare: they all play the same game. You’re not a customer; you’re a liability score. And when the algorithm flags you, good luck getting a real person on the line. Vendor lock-in isn’t just technical—it’s bureaucratic, and far more dangerous.

Meanwhile, Finland’s proposal to ban social media for minors—following Australia’s lead—has sparked the usual ideological trench warfare. On one side: yes, algorithmic feeds are attention engines optimized for addiction, not connection. The internet circa 2004—MySpace, phpBB, GeoCities—was messy, but it wasn’t designed to hijack dopamine circuits. On the other: bans don’t fix incentives. They just push kids to darker corners or fuel surveillance-grade age verification. The real problem isn’t access—it’s business models built on behavioral surplus. Regulate the tracking, the microtargeting, the infinite scroll, not the platforms themselves. But that would require political will, and we’re short on that. Instead, we get paternalistic UI bans while Meta and TikTok keep harvesting.

And speaking of harvesting: generative AI is now flooding Wikipedia with citations that look real but don’t substantiate anything. Over two-thirds of AI-edited articles fail verification. That’s not just noise—it’s epistemic pollution. LLMs don’t fact-check; they pattern-match. And when they’re trained on existing Wikipedia content—some of which is already dubious—they amplify the errors. The system was fragile before; now it’s under active attack. Worse, the response often feels like astroturfing—green-name accounts downplaying the issue, as if admitting AI’s unreliability would undermine the whole enterprise. But the writing’s on the wall: if we don’t rebuild verification from the ground up, Wikipedia becomes just another hallucination engine.

Which loops us back to the cognitive cost of all this. “Outsourcing Thinking” isn’t just a catchy title—it’s what we’re doing every time we let an LLM draft an email, write a function, or summarize a paper. Unlike a calculator, which gives deterministic output, LLMs are stochastic opinion machines. They don’t compute; they guess. And when we defer to them routinely, we lose the muscle memory for reasoning, for spotting bullshit, for knowing what a good answer even looks like. Some argue this is inevitable—like complaining about cars making people lazy walkers. But driving doesn’t erode your ability to navigate; AI might. Especially when the next generation treats it as the source of truth, not a sketchpad.

That’s why projects like Pi, a minimal coding agent with tight context control, are interesting—not because they’re smarter, but because they’re constrained. The goal isn’t autonomy; it’s augmentation. But even then, the sandboxing question looms. If your agent can run code, especially in a language like Python, how do you stop it from escaping? Most “security” measures are theater. VMs, containers, firewalls—bypassable if the interpreter is in play. And if the agent has internet access? Game over. We’re building digital id, and we’re doing it without seatbelts.

Elsewhere, the absurdity continues. Autonomous cars and drones being fooled by sticker-modified road signs? That’s not prompt injection—it’s environmental hacking. And the fact that some people are now deliberately trolling Waymo cars as a form of anti-tech protest says more about cultural alienation than it does about AI robustness. But let’s not pretend this is just about stickers. If real-world systems are using vision-language models in production (and evidence suggests they are), then they’re vulnerable to any visual perturbation that shifts the semantic interpretation. And no amount of “more training data” fixes a fundamental lack of world models.

On a lighter note, someone built a code editor and game engine for the Nintendo DS. It runs one script line per frame. That’s not a limitation—it’s a philosophy. In an era of bloated frameworks and megabyte-sized npm packages, there’s something radical about programming within hard constraints. The DS homebrew scene thrives precisely because it’s not trying to be anything else. It’s tinkering for the sake of it. Like the guy who made “List animals until failure”—a simple parser with hardcoded responses and Easter eggs. No AI, no cloud, just a dumb little game that sparks joy because it’s predictable, finite, and human.

Meanwhile, Swift fans are having a rough time. The language may feel more ergonomic than Rust, but Xcode’s bloat, SPM’s weakness, and memory leaks in SwiftUI apps are real. And let’s not pretend Swift is cross-platform—Apple’s ecosystem is its oxygen. Outside of that, it’s a language in exile. Rust may be harder, but at least it doesn’t tie your hands behind your back and call it safety.

And finally: Berlin’s potato surplus. A record harvest, so many spuds they’re giving them away. Poetic, in a way. While we argue about blockchain, AI, and zero trust, farmers are drowning in earth apples. One user joked about leveraged potato ETFs. Another pointed out that you can’t short a tuber. But maybe that’s the lesson: some systems—agricultural, social, cognitive—don’t optimize well. They’re messy, perishable, and resistant to abstraction. And maybe that’s okay.

Worth watching: Genode OS. Not because it’ll replace Linux, but because its capability-based, microkernel-driven design is one of the few real attempts to build security into the stack from the ground up. If we ever get serious about untrusted code, we’ll end up reinventing something like it.
