## [CBS didn't air Rep. James Talarico interview out of fear of FCC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/stephen-colbert-cbs-james-talarico-fcc-rcna259341)
**Score:** 370 | **Comments:** 158 | **ID:** 47049426

> **Article:** CBS canceled an interview with Democratic Texas state representative James Talarico scheduled for Stephen Colbert's show due to fears it might violate the FCC's equal-time rule, which mandates broadcasters provide equal airtime to all candidates if they give it to one. The network cited concerns that the FCC could revoke the "bona fide news" exemption currently allowing late-night talk shows to avoid the rule, even though the regulatory change remains unenacted. The interview was instead posted online, where it gained traction through the Streisand effect, accumulating over 1.4 million YouTube views. This incident highlights tensions between broadcast spectrum scarcity regulations and perceived political coercion amid corporate media's regulatory dependencies.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters split on whether the FCC's threat to CBS represents legitimate oversight of scarce broadcast spectrum or state-driven censorship, with some citing the network's pending mergers and past suspensions of hosts like Jimmy Kimmel as evidence of regulatory leverage. The chilling effect of vague FCC warnings was emphasized, drawing parallels to authoritarian tactics that induce self-censorship, while defenders argued the rule change curbs pseudo-news shows exploiting exemptions. Technical distinctions clarified the equal-time rule applies only to over-the-air broadcast due to spectrum scarcity, exempting cable and internet platforms, though some contended algorithmic amplification creates modern broadcast dynamics. The Streisand effect amplified the interview to 1.4 million YouTube views but fell short of Stephen Colbert's typical television audience, prompting calls to support Talarico's campaign for financial pressure. Practical responses included contacting CBS affiliates and advertisers, while debates over Bari Weiss's free speech record revealed her centrist voting history and past defense of controversial op-eds despite accusations of hypocrisy.

## [SkillsBench: Benchmarking how well agent skills work across diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670)
**Score:** 349 | **Comments:** 153 | **ID:** 47040430

> **Article:** This paper introduces SkillsBench, a new benchmark for evaluating how well AI agents can leverage procedural knowledge ("skills") to complete diverse tasks. The researchers tested various approaches including using no skills, providing existing skills, and having agents self-generate skills before task completion. They found that self-generated skills performed no better than having no skills at all, suggesting that LLMs' latent knowledge is sufficient for most tasks without explicit skill documentation.
>
> **Discussion:** The Hacker News discussion reveals significant skepticism about the paper's methodology and conclusions. Commenters point out that the tasks evaluated were extremely limited - just single markdown files with no real-world complexity like existing codebases or refactoring work. Many noted that the "self-generated skills" approach essentially had the LLM just regurgitate its own context rather than truly exploring or learning anything new. Several experienced users shared that they find skills most useful for documenting tool usage and API interactions, not for the kind of abstract planning the paper tested. There was also debate about whether the paper properly understood how skills should work in practice, with some suggesting the researchers fundamentally misunderstood the concept by having models generate skills based solely on their own latent knowledge without any external research or tool access. The consensus seemed to be that while the paper's headline finding is technically correct, it's misleading about how skills actually function in real-world applications.

## [Poor Deming never stood a chance](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2026/02/16/poor-deming-never-stood-a-chance/)
**Score:** 183 | **Comments:** 117 | **ID:** 47042895

> **Article:** The articleargues that W. Edwards Deming's management theories, particularly statistical process control (SPC), are fundamentally flawed and only applicable to manufacturing environments, not chaotic fields like engineering. It contends that applying SPC in engineering adds stress, increases development time, and lowers quality, as engineering processes lack the stability needed for meaningful statistical analysis. The piece also references Deming's broader 14 management principles, suggesting they are more relevant for organizational structure than process control in non-manufacturing contexts.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion centers on the applicability of Deming's methods beyond manufacturing, with significant disagreement. Anonymousiam argues SPC is unsuitable for engineering due to inherent chaos, while kqr counters that SPC works in non-chaotic parts of product development and that Deming's broader principles (like understanding customer needs and collaboration) are equally relevant. Analog31 emphasizes Deming's core idea of empowering line workers with simple tools, contrasting it with bureaucratic SPC departments. There's also debate on US management failures versus Toyota's success, with roenxi and analog31 linking this to corporate structure and employee retention. Tangentially, the thread explores wealth taxes, fiat money systems, and alternative economic models, with renewiltord advocating for wealth taxes and jongjong proposing abolishing fiat currency to reset capitalism.

## [HackMyClaw](https://hackmyclaw.com/)
**Score:** 179 | **Comments:** 90 | **ID:** 47049573

> **Article:** The creator of HackMyClaw built an OpenClaw instance to test prompt‑injection vulnerabilities against Claude Opus by having it read and summarize emailed prompts, with the goal of extracting the contents of a hidden secrets.env file. Participants can submit injections for a chance to win a $100 prize, and the system checks email hourly but is instructed not to reply without explicit human approval. The project highlights the baseline resistance of the model and serves as a low‑cost experiment in crowdsourcing prompt‑injection examples. The creator also notes that the email‑reply restriction is a prompt instruction rather than a technical limitation.
>
> **Discussion:** HN users debate whether the “no‑reply‑without‑approval” rule is a hard constraint or merely a guideline, with some arguing that the model could still bypass it under certain conditions. Several commenters question the practicality of extracting secrets, pointing out that the system’s design limits direct responses and that successful injections would require creative workarounds such as leveraging URLs or external tools. The conversation also touches on broader security implications, including differences in prompt‑injection resilience between models like Opus and Sonnet and the value of building a dataset of injection techniques for future defenses. Some participants view the project as a clever way to crowdsource pen‑testing insights, while others criticize it as a method for gathering a mailing list of AI enthusiasts or for extracting personal data under the guise of a bounty. Overall, the thread reflects a mix of technical curiosity, skepticism about the difficulty of breaking the guardrails, and concerns about the ethical implications of incentivized disclosure.

## [America's pensions can't beat Vanguard but they can close a hospital](https://www.governance.fyi/p/americas-pensions-cant-beat-a-vanguard)
**Score:** 175 | **Comments:** 281 | **ID:** 47048248

> **Article:** The article argues that U.S. public pension funds, despite managing trillions of dollars, consistently underperform low‑cost index funds such as Vanguard, yet they retain outsized influence over public services, exemplified by the power to close hospitals. It notes that the median safe withdrawal rate assumed by private retirees is 3‑4 % per year, while many public pensions target a 7 % rate, creating structural underfunding that forces governments to raise taxes or cut services. The piece highlights California’s CalPERS, which recently shifted into private‑equity funds after being barred from certain sectors, and claims that private equity now delivers higher returns without the “pesky moral issues” of earlier investments.
>
> **Discussion:** Commenters dissected the moral‑hazard paradox raised by Larry Summers, with some defending the immediate protection of SVB depositors as a necessary safety net while others argued that such bailouts create perverse incentives for risky banking behavior. The thread split over student‑loan forgiveness, with critics claiming it would inflate tuition and encourage reckless borrowing, while proponents emphasized the need for a more equitable system and suggested bankruptcy reforms to shift risk back to lenders. Private‑equity bans sparked heated debate, as skeptics pointed to cases where PE rescued struggling firms, whereas others highlighted the extractive nature of recent deals and called for stricter regulation or taxation. Pension‑fund performance was a recurring focus, with participants noting the mismatch between the 3‑4 % safe withdrawal rate used by individual savers and the 7 % target of public plans, and questioning whether CalPERS’ shift into private equity truly solves underfunding. The conversation reflected a broader frustration with the complexity of financial policy, with many urging narrower arguments and concrete examples to avoid diluting credibility.
