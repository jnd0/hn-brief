The thread explored age-related learning dynamics, with proponents citing neuroplasticity enabling faster skill acquisition in youth versus adults' advantages in disciplined study and prior knowledge, while skeptics questioned whether measurable progress in novel fields remains comparable across life stages. Technical critiques focused on the structure's failure under lateral loads and impracticality at shelter scales, yet a subset envisioned applications in 3D-printed composites or medical devices where origami-inspired folding offers cost-effective strength. Parental involvement emerged as a contentious theme, with several users arguing that guided experimentation diminishes the narrative of solo brilliance, while others acknowledged the rarity of sustained youth engagement in complex hands-on projects. Overall, the discussion balanced admiration for Wu's hands-on experimentation against skepticism about headline claims, framing his work as a stepping stone rather than a definitive solution.  

Qwen3.5, a new multimodal AI model, aims to provide native multimodal capabilities and run high-performance AI locally. It targets future hardware like the 2026 M5 Max MacBook Pro, with benchmarks suggesting near-Sonnet 4.5 performance. The release includes various model sizes for different use cases and hardware constraints. Discussion: The Hacker News discussion centered on skepticism about the model's training methods and benchmarks, with some users suggesting it may be benchmarking or training on frontier model outputs rather than demonstrating genuine advancement. There was debate about the practicality of running large open-source models locally, with questions about optimal hardware configurations and whether the increasing model sizes make local deployment impractical compared to cloud solutions. Users also discussed the need for better benchmarks that can't be easily gamed, with some proposing novel approaches to generate truly novel test cases that prevent overfitting. Technical discussions included specific hardware recommendations, with mentions of the AMD Strix Halo's 128GB memory configuration and comparisons to other GPU setups for running large models.  

Anthropic's efforts to hide Claude's AI actions have sparked backlash among developers. Critics argue that concealing AI behavior undermines transparency, while others defend the changes as necessary for scalable, long-running agent teams. Comments highlight frustrations over outdated codebases, slow feedback loops, and the need for better visibility into AI outputs. Some users prefer traditional prompts and code reviews, while others embrace new tools for automation and maintenance. The conversation reflects broader debates about balancing innovation with reliability in AI development. Multiple voices expressed disagreement over how much transparency is needed for AI agents. Some praised the new approaches for improving speed and reducing noise, while others criticized the lack of control and the risk of agents making irreversible changes. Technical concerns centered on code quality, maintenance, and the real-world impact of autonomous AI teams. The debate underscores the tension between efficiency gains and the need for clear oversight in complex AI systems.  

Western Digital has declared its hard-drive inventory exhausted for the entire year, attributing the shortage to surging demand from AI-driven workloads. AI models now require petabytes of training data and high-resolution video output, with the Seedance 2.0 platform cited as an example of cost-effective CGI production. The piece argues that massive state and private subsidies for AI are distorting market signals, allowing prices to rise unchecked and creating a bubble that could burst when funding dries up. Discussion: Commenters split between those who see the shortage as a genuine reflection of AI’s appetite for compute and storage and those who view it as a symptom of irrational capital flows. Several users point out the physical constraints of building new factories, noting that producers need price signals strong enough to justify multi-year capex, and warn that a temporary boom could leave them stranded if demand collapses. Others highlight broader hardware scarcity, arguing that AI will strain GPUs, CPUs, RAM, networking gear, and even energy supplies, while some skeptics cite the 2022 GPU crash and the lingering effects of reduced semiconductor investment.
