## [Marc Andreessen Bet Big on Trump. It's Paying Off for Silicon Valley](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-cfpb-marc-andreessen-silicon-valley)
**Score:** 12 | **Comments:** 0 | **ID:** 46842252

> **Article:** The ProPublica article details how venture capitalist Marc Andreessen advocated for and supported Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, particularly pushing for the appointment of financial deregulation proponents like Keith Noreika at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This strategic influence helped shape policies favorable to fintech startups and Silicon Valley interests, leading to regulatory rollbacks that benefited the tech and financial sectors. The article suggests Andreessen's political engagement has yielded tangible returns for the tech industry through deregulation and policy shifts.
>
> **Discussion:** Since no comments were available on the HN post, there is no community discussion to summarize. The absence of user engagement means no themes, disagreements, technical insights, or reactions can be reported. Typically, such an article might spark debate over the ethics of tech leaders influencing politics, the impact of deregulation on innovation and consumer protection, or skepticism about the long-term wisdom of aligning with controversial political figures—but none of these appear here. As a result, the discussion section remains empty due to a lack of input.

## [Show HN: An Open Source Alternative to Vercel/Render/Netlify](https://github.com/aryankashyap0/shorlabs)

> **Project:** Shorlabs is an open-source platform presented as an alternative to hosting services like Vercel, Render, and Netlify, aiming to provide developers with a self-hostable solution for deploying and managing web applications. The project was submitted as a Show HN to gain visibility within the Hacker News community.
>
> **Discussion:** The discussion quickly shifted from technical evaluation to moderation action, as a moderator (tomhow) called out apparent vote manipulation and banned the involved accounts and domains. The moderator emphasized that genuine, interesting projects do not need artificial promotion and that the HN team is vigilant about maintaining discussion integrity. Community reaction was minimal due to the swift intervention, with no technical feedback on the project itself, underscoring Hacker News's strict stance against self-promotion tactics that violate site guidelines.
