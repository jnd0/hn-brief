## [Semantic ablation: Why AI writing is generic and boring](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/16/semantic_ablation_ai_writing/)
**Score:** 211 | **Comments:** 175 | **ID:** 47049088

> **Article:** The article "Semantic ablation: Why AI writing is generic and boring" argues that large language models (LLMs) produce homogenized text because their training objectives, particularly reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), systematically reward blandness and penalize surprising or distinct phrasing. It claims LLMs replace rare, domain-specific tokens with common synonyms—such as substituting a 1-in-10,000 token with a 1-in-100 synonym—thereby diluting semantic density and eroding the "jagged edges" that make human writing engaging. The piece frames this as an intended outcome of aligning models with human preferences for clarity and safety, making originality difficult to recover through prompting alone. The author, a professor of pharmaceutical technology and biomaterials, positions the issue as a cultural loss rather than a technical flaw, noting AI's prevalence in blogs, news articles, and even obituaries has created a pervasive "AI voice" that feels soul-crushing to many readers.
>
> **Discussion:** The thread debates whether AI writing is inherently inferior to human prose, with svara and lich_king acknowledging its utility for average writers seeking clear communication, while barrkel and Terretta insist LLMs strip away the distinctive "luminous translucency" of human voice even when prompted for style. SignalStackDev provides a technical insight that RLHF concentrates probability mass toward median human preferences by penalizing distinctiveness, making prompt engineering insufficient to recover originality once models are heavily tuned. This creates tension between prompt-engineering optimism—lurquer argues careful prompts can remediate blandness—and skepticism from contributors like co_king_5, who question whether critics can reliably detect generic prose. Community reactions range from resigned cultural criticism about AI's ubiquity (stephc_int13, empiko) to nitpicky skepticism from NitpickLawyer, who dismisses the piece as uninformed, while resiros questions why labs don't prioritize artistic writing and delis-thumbs-7e argues "generative AI" is a misnomer. PurpleRamen adds nuance by suggesting model collapse fears may have been averted through awareness, highlighting the complexity of technical and cultural impacts.
